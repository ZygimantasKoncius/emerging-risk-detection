Business General MutualFirst Financial, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“MutualFirst” or the “Company”), is the sole owner of MutualBank (“MutualBank” or the “Bank”). The Bank is an Indiana commercial bank regulated by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (“IDFI”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). MutualFirst is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). The words “we,” “our” and “us” in this Form 10-K refer to MutualFirst and MutualBank on a consolidated basis, unless indicated otherwise herein. At December 31, 2014, we had total assets of $1.4 billion, loans of $1.0 billion, deposits of $1.1 billion and stockholders’ equity of $127.5 million. Our executive offices are located at 110 E. Charles Street, Muncie, Indiana 47305-2400.

Market Area We are a community-oriented bank offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities we serve. We are headquartered in Muncie, Indiana and offer our financial services through 30 full service retail financial center offices in Delaware, Elkhart, Grant, Kosciusko, Randolph, St. Joseph and Wabash counties. MutualBank also has trust offices in Carmel and Crawfordsville, Indiana and a loan origination office in New Buffalo, Michigan. Mutual has a subsidiary, Summit Mortgage, Inc., that operates a mortgage banking firm in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. In addition, we originate residential mortgage and commercial loans in the counties contiguous to those counties. We also originate indirect consumer loans throughout Indiana and contiguous states as described in “Lending Activities - Other Consumer Lending.” 3 The market areas where MutualBank operates in Indiana have historically experienced an unemployment rate that has exceeded the federal and state unemployment rates, though that difference was reduced in 2014 to below the state rates. At the end of 2014, the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) was 5.4% at the federal level and 5.8% at the state level, compared to 6.5% and 6.3% at the end of 2013 at the federal and state level, respectively. Our footprint had an unemployment rate of 5.7% and 6.9% at year-end 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our markets are experiencing new jobs in the aerospace industry, and jobs in the auto and recreational vehicles industry have improved since the beginning of the recession. During 2014, improvements in local home values, unemployment and the local economy resulted in increasing levels of home sales and residential mortgage activity. Economic forecasts for 2015 include continuing, but not significant, improvement in unemployment and the overall economy in our footprint markets. Competition We face strong competition from other banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers and finance companies in originating commercial, real estate and other loans and in attracting deposits. Our wealth management division faces strong competition from other banks, brokerage firms, financial advisers and trust companies. We attract deposits primarily through our branch network. Competition for deposits comes principally from local banks and credit unions, but also comes from the availability of other investment opportunities, including mutual funds. We compete for deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. We also offer alternative investment products through a broker/dealer. Internet Website and Information The Company maintains a website at www.bankwithmutual.com - “About Us – Investor Relations.” The information contained on that website is not included as part of or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. The Company’s filings with the SEC are available on that website and also are available on the SEC website at sec.gov - “Search for Company Filings.” Lending Activities General. Our loans carry either a fixed- or an adjustable-rate of interest. At December 31, 2014, our net loan portfolio totaled $1.0 billion, which constituted 70.9% of our total assets. Our loan portfolio increased by 4.3% in 2014, primarily due to increased commercial construction and development, commercial and industrial, and consumer loans including open end and junior loans; however, that increase was slightly offset by a decrease in commercial real estate and consumer first mortgage loans. Loans up to $600,000 may be approved by certain individual loan officers. Loans in excess of $600,000, but not in excess of $1.2 million, may be approved by one Executive Loan Committee member along with one other loan officer to the total of their combined individual lending authority. Loans up to $3.0 million or to a borrower whose aggregate debt is no more than $5.0 million, may be approved by a majority vote of the Executive Loan Committee. All loans in excess of $3.0 million and loans of any amount to a borrower whose aggregate debt will exceed $5.0 million must be approved by the Board of Directors. Business Banking Officers may advance additional credit exposure for a commercial loan relationship requiring Board approval up to the lesser of: 10% of the existing previously approved credit exposure to the client, or $100,000. Any additional exposure approved under the 10% Rule must be approved by the Senior Vice President of Business Banking or his designate, and reported to the appropriate Loan Committee during the next meeting. 4 Major loan customers. At December 31, 2014, the maximum amount that we could lend to any one borrower and the borrower’s related entities was approximately $20.5 million. At December 31, 2014, our five largest lending relationships were with commercial borrowers and public entities and constituted an aggregate of $24.9 million in loans outstanding and $50.9 million, or 4.9%, of our $1.0 billion gross loan portfolio in loans and commitments. As of December 31, 2014, our largest lending relationship to a single borrower or group of related borrowers consisted of one loan with a total commitment of $12.2 million, with no outstanding balance at year-end. The loan in this relationship is secured by commercial real estate. Our next four largest relationships consist of $11.3 million in loans and commitments with $2.7 million outstanding which is secured primarily by bonds; $11.0 million in loans and commitments with $7.9 million outstanding which is secured by commercial real estate; $9.7 million in loans and commitments with $7.6 million outstanding which is secured primarily by commercial business assets; and $6.7 million in loans and commitments issued and outstanding which is secured primarily by commercial real estate. As of December 31, 2014, all loans within these relationships were performing as agreed. 5 The following table presents information concerning the composition of our loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages as of the dates indicated.

We originate loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences in our market areas for purchase, refinance, home equity and construction purposes. At December 31, 2014, these loans totaled $523.2 million, or 50.9% of our gross loan portfolio. We generally underwrite and document our one- to four-family loans based on the loan applicant’s employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property, consistent with secondary market standards or other prudent underwriting guidelines. For loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%, we generally require private mortgage insurance to reduce our exposure to below 80%. Properties securing our one- to four-family loans are appraised or evaluated consistent with regulatory requirements and prudent lending principles. Origination and servicing practices ensure perfection of our lien position and appropriate monitoring of insurance and tax payments. We generally underwrite and document our one- to four-family first lien position home equity loans based on the loan applicant's employment, credit history and the appraised value of the subject property, consistent with prudent underwriting guidelines. Nearly all first lien home equity loans have a loan-to-value maximum of 80%. Exceptions would be limited to work-out loan circumstances. Properties securing our one- to four-family loans are appraised or evalutated consistent with regulatory requirements and prudent lending principles. Our origination and servicing practices ensure perfection of our lien position and appropriate monitoring of insurance coverage. We originate consumer first mortgage one- to four-family loans on either a fixed- or adjustable-rate basis, and generally maintain a tax or insurance escrow account for these loans. Our pricing strategy for mortgage loans includes setting interest rates that are competitive with the secondary market and other local financial institutions and are consistent with our internal needs. Adjustable-rate mortgage or ARM loans are offered with initial fixed rate terms between one and 10 years. After the initial period, the interest rate for each ARM loan adjusts annually for the remainder of the term of the loan using a margin over the standard one-year treasury index. During fiscal 2014, we originated $17.7 million of one- to four-family ARM loans and $86.8 million of one- to four-family fixed-rate mortgage loans. By way of comparison, during fiscal 2013, we originated $15.9 million of one- to four-family ARM loans and $140.9 million of one- to four-family fixed-rate mortgage loans. Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences have contractual maturities of up to 30 years and are generally fully amortizing, with payments due monthly. A majority of loans with fixed-rate maturities in excess of 15 years are sold on the secondary market. Some loans are retained if their terms meet current portfolio needs consistent with balance sheet objectives. These retained loans normally remain outstanding, however, for a substantially shorter period of time because of home sales, refinancing and other prepayments. A significant change in interest rates could alter considerably the average life of a residential loan in our portfolio. Our one- to four-family loans are generally not assumable, do not contain prepayment penalties and do not permit negative amortization of principal. Most are written using underwriting guidelines that make them readily saleable in the secondary market. At December 31, 2014, our fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loan portfolio totaled $392.4 million, or 38.2% of our gross loan portfolio. 9 Our one- to four-family residential ARM loans are fully amortizing loans with contractual maturities of up to 30 years, with payments due monthly. Our ARM loans generally provide for specific minimum and maximum interest rates, with a lifetime cap and floor, and a periodic adjustment on the interest rate over the rate in effect on the date of origination. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on these loans may not be as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. In order to remain competitive in our market areas, we sometimes originate ARM loans at initial rates below the fully indexed rate. ARM loans generally pose different credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrower’s required payments increase, which may increase the potential for default. Our payment history for ARM loans has not been substantially different from fixed rate loans. See “Asset Quality - Non-performing Assets” and “Classified Assets.” At December 31, 2014, our one- to four-family ARM loan portfolio totaled $130.8 million, or 12.7% of our gross loan portfolio. Construction-permanent loans on one- to four-family residential properties are obtained through referral business with builders, from walk-in customers and through referrals from realtors and architects. The applicant must submit complete plans, specifications and costs of the project to be constructed, which, along with an independent appraisal, are used to determine the value of the subject property. Loans are based on the lesser of the current appraised value and/or the cost of construction, including the land and the building. We generally conduct regular inspections of the construction project being financed. Residential construction loans are done with one closing for both the construction period and the long-term financing. Loans are generally granted with a construction period between six and 12 months. During the construction phase, the borrower generally pays interest only on a monthly basis, and the loan is automatically converted to amortizing payments upon completion of the construction. Single family construction loans with loan-to-value ratios over 80% usually require private mortgage insurance. Consumer Open End and Junior Liens. At December 31, 2014, our consumer loans on residential properties, including home equity lines of credit and subordinate home improvement loans, totaled $71.1 million, or 6.9% of our gross loan portfolio. These loans may be originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 100% of the value of the property securing the loan. The term to maturity on our home equity and home improvement loans may be up to 15 years. Most home equity lines of credit have a maximum term to maturity of 20 years and require a minimum monthly payment based on the outstanding loan balance per month, which amount may be re-borrowed at any time. A limited number of home equity lines of credit are approved with monthly payments of accrued interest only. Other consumer loan terms vary according to the type of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. 10 Commercial Real Estate Lending. We offer a variety of multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) loans for acquisition and renovation. These loans are secured by the real estate and improvements financed, and the collateral ranges from industrial and commercial buildings to churches, office buildings and multi-family housing complexes. We also have a limited amount of farm loans. At December 31, 2014, multi-family and commercial real estate loans totaled $198.0 million, or 19.3% of our gross loan portfolio. Our loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate are originated with either a fixed or adjustable interest rate. The interest rate on adjustable-rate loans is based on a variety of indices, generally determined through negotiation with the borrower. Loan-to-value ratios on our multi-family and commercial real estate loans typically do not exceed 80% of the current appraised value of the property securing the loan. These loans typically require monthly payments, may not be fully amortizing and generally have maximum amortizations of 25 years. Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate are underwritten based on the income-producing potential of the property and the financial strength of the borrower. For income-producing properties, net operating income must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding debt. Owner-occupied CRE loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s ability to generate cash flow sufficient to repay the loan. We may require personal guarantees of the borrowers in addition to the real estate as collateral for such loans. We also generally require an assignment of rents or leases in order to be assured that the cash flow from the real estate can be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing multi-family and commercial real estate loans are performed by qualified independent appraisers approved by MutualBank’s board of directors, consistent with regulatory requirements. See “Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Repayments” in this Item 1. In order to monitor the adequacy of cash flows on CRE loans, the borrower is required to provide periodic financial information. Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. See “Asset Quality - Non-performing Assets” in this Item 1. Construction and Development Lending. MutualBank makes a variety of commercial loans for the purpose of construction or development of commercial real estate. Existing residential development loans are typically provided on property located within our market areas and are granted to developers and builders with previous borrowing experience with MutualBank. Financing of a development may include funding of land acquisition and development costs for lots as well as individual construction loans for speculative or pre-sold homes. New activity in residential development and construction lending has been limited by economic conditions for the past several years. We also provide construction-permanent financing for owner-occupied commercial properties for our business customers in our market areas as well as some income-producing property to established borrowers. We have a limited number of commercial real estate development loans. At December 31, 2014, we had $33.1 million in construction and development loans outstanding, representing 3.2% of our gross loan portfolio. 11 Loans financing land development may include funding the acquisition of the land, the infrastructure and lot sales. Development loans are secured by real estate and repaid through proceeds from the sale of lots. The maximum loan amount should not exceed 75% of the appraised value and projected lot sales should show full payout within 24-36 months of each phase being financed. Where the development loan is to be repaid through lot sales to third parties, the loan should be paid in full when no more than 80% of the lots in the phase or development are sold. Release prices should not be less than 85% of the net sales proceeds, or 125% of the original committed amount per lot, whichever is greater. Construction financing must be supported by prints and specs, and an appraisal by an approved appraiser. Construction draws must be supported by a detailed list of work completed, and where appropriate, lien waivers from all contractors. All construction loans should have a maturity date with a written end financing commitment. We also provide end financing to qualified borrowers. Our maximum advance on residential pre-sold and owner occupied commercial loans is 80% of appraised value. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction and development costs and the market for the project upon completion, there is risk inherent in the accuracy of estimated total loan funds required to complete a project, the related loan-to-value ratios and the likelihood of ultimate success of the project. These loans also involve many of the same risks discussed above regarding multi-family and commercial real estate loans and tend to be more sensitive to general economic conditions than many other types of loans. Economic conditions in our market areas over the past few years could cause borrowers to be unable to repay development loans due to reduced ability to market the properties consistent with original pro-forma estimates. However, we have seen stabilization in our markets in 2014 which is reflected in the decrease in non-performing assets. Other Consumer Lending. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity and carry higher rates of interest than residential mortgage loans. This reduces our exposure to interest rate risk on these loans. In addition, consumer loan products help to expand and create stronger ties to our customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. We offer a variety of secured consumer loans, including auto, boat and recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by savings deposits. We also offer credit cards and unsecured consumer loans. We originate consumer loans both in our market area through our financial centers and throughout Indiana as well as making consumer loans to customers residing in contiguous states through our indirect lending program. We employ credit scoring models for all consumer loan applications. These models evaluate credit and application attributes, with a review of the borrower’s employment and credit history and an assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, especially consumer loans secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by economic downturn, job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. At December 31, 2014, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $114.7 million, or 11.2% of our gross loan portfolio. 12 At December 31, 2014, auto loans totaled $14.7 million, or 1.4% of our gross loan portfolio. Auto loans may be written for up to six years and usually have a fixed rate of interest. Loan-to-value ratios are up to 100% of the MSRP or 120% of invoice for new autos and 110% of value on used cars, based on valuation from official used car guides. Loans for boats and recreational vehicles totaled $94.8 million at December 31, 2014, or 9.2% of our gross loan portfolio. Approximately $90.8 million of other consumer loans at December 31, 2014 had been originated indirectly through dealers and retailers. We generally buy indirect auto loans on a rate basis, paying the dealer a cash payment for loans with an interest rate in excess of the rate we require. This premium is amortized over the remaining life of the loan. As specified in written agreements with these dealers, prepayments or delinquencies are charged to future amounts owed to that dealer, with no dealer reserve or other guarantee of payment if the dealer stops doing business with us. Commercial Business Lending. At December 31, 2014, commercial business loans totaled $88.5 million, or 8.6% of our gross loan portfolio. Most of our commercial business loans have been extended to finance businesses in our market area. Credit accommodations extended include lines of credit for working capital needs, term loans to purchase capital goods and real estate, development lending to foster residential, business and community growth and agricultural lending for inventory and equipment financing. Our commercial business lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower’s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower’s capital and collateral as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower’s past, present and future cash flows also is an important aspect of our credit analysis. We may obtain personal guarantees on our commercial business loans. Nonetheless, these loans are believed to carry higher credit risk than residential loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may substantially depend on the success of the business itself (which, in turn, often depends in part upon general economic conditions). Our commercial business loans are usually secured by business assets. However, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. The terms of loans extended on the security of machinery and equipment are based on the projected useful life of the machinery and equipment, generally not to exceed seven years. Lines of credit generally are available to borrowers for up to 12 months, and may be renewed by us after an annual review of current financial information. 13 We issue a few financial-based standby letters of credit which are offered at competitive rates and terms and are generally on a secured basis. We continue to expand our volume of commercial business loans. Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Repayments. We originate loans through referrals from real estate brokers and builders, our marketing efforts, our existing and walk-in customers, and through our subsidiary, Summit Mortgage, Inc. Historically, we have originated many of our non-real estate consumer loans through relationships with dealerships. While we originate adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans, our ability to originate loans depends upon customer demand for loans in our market areas. Demand is affected by local competition and the interest rate environment. During the last several years, due to low market rates of interest, our dollar volume of fixed-rate, one- to four-family loans has exceeded the dollar volume of the same type of adjustable-rate loans. As part of our interest rate risk management efforts, we have from time to time sold our fixed rate, one- to four-family residential loans. We have occasionally purchased adjustable rate one- to four-family residential and commercial real estate loans. In periods of economic uncertainty, the ability of financial institutions, including us, to originate or purchase large dollar volumes of loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a resultant decrease in interest income. The Company originates consumer loans in Indiana and contiguous states through our indirect lending program. The indirect lending consumer portfolio consists of loans for autos, boats and recreational vehicles. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold $62.8 million of one- to four-family mortgage loans on the secondary market to FHLMC and Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”). As part of our interest rate risk management, the Company chose to sell these loans and recognized a gain on sale of $1.9 million. 14 The following table shows our loan origination, purchase, sale and repayment activities for the years indicated.

When a borrower fails to make a payment on a mortgage loan on or before the default date, a late charge and delinquency notice is mailed. All delinquent accounts are reviewed by a collector, who attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower once the loan is 30 days past due. If the loan becomes 30 days delinquent, the collector will generally contact the borrower by phone or send a letter to the borrower in order to identify the reason for the delinquency. Once the loan becomes 60 days delinquent, the borrower is asked to pay the delinquent amount in full, or establish an acceptable repayment plan to bring the loan current. Prior to foreclosure, a drive-by inspection is made to determine the condition of the property. If the account becomes 120 days delinquent, and an acceptable repayment plan has not been agreed upon, a collection officer will generally refer the account to legal counsel, with instructions to prepare a notice of intent to foreclose. The notice of intent to foreclose allows the borrower up to 30 days to bring the account current. During this 30-day period, the collector may accept a repayment plan from the borrower that would bring the account current prior to foreclosure. The Bank will suspend foreclosure activities when directed by government-sponsored entities or the Bank’s regulator; however we have received no such requests. For consumer loans, a similar collection process is followed, with the initial written contact being made once the loan is 20 days past due. Commercial loan relationships exceeding $250,000 are reviewed on a regular basis by the commercial credit department. Larger relationships are monitored through a system of internal and external loan review. All relationships that are deemed to warrant special attention are monitored at least quarterly. Individual commercial officers maintain communication with borrowers and recommend action plans to a Loan Quality Review committee which meets monthly to discuss credits graded Special Mention or worse. The Asset Classification committee meets quarterly and establishes specific allocations, based on appraisals or discounted cash flow analysis, for relationships that are deemed to be under-collateralized and at risk of non-payment. Collection and loss mitigation efforts are a cooperative effort between the Commercial Loan Department and the Risk Management Division. Delinquent Loans. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2014, the amounts and categories of delinquent loans that were still accruing interest. Accruing Loans Delinquent For 30 to 59 Days 60 to 89 Days (Dollars in thousands) Real estate Commercial $1,308 $705 Commercial construction and development - - Consumer closed end first mortgage 7,782 973 Consumer open end and junior liens 540 51 Consumer loans 910 128 Commercial and industrial 1,066 176 Total $11,606 $2,033 Total as a percent of total loans 1.1% 0.2% 16 Non-performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of non-performing assets in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated. Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status when the loan becomes more than 90 days delinquent or sooner when collection of interest becomes doubtful. At December 31, 2014, we had troubled debt restructurings totaling $6.8 million, $2.2 million of which were included in non-accruing loans. Troubled debt restructurings involve forgiving a portion of interest or principal or making other adjustments to assist a borrower who is unable to meet the original terms of the loan. These restructurings are included in non-accruing loans until they perform according to the modified terms for six months. Then, if continued payments under the modified terms are deemed probable, and it is anticipated all principal will be recovered, they are removed from non-accrual status. Foreclosed assets owned include assets acquired in settlement of loans. December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in thousands) Non-accruing loans(1): Commercial real estate $2,023 $1,349 $2,450 $7,592 $6,040 Commercial construction and development 209 1,103 5,989 9,314 7,399 Consumer closed end first mortgage 3,499 4,057 11,030 10,433 12,781 Consumer open end and junior liens 658 421 1,396 1,087 1,862 Total real estate loans 6,389 6,930 20,865 28,426 28,082 Other loans: Total consumer other 218 361 1,230 1,125 1,082 Commercial and industrial 605 1,109 1,315 1,160 1,019 Total other loans 823 1,470 2,545 2,285 2,101 Total non-accruing loans 7,212 8,400 23,410 30,711 30,183 Accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more: Consumer closed end first mortgage 226 175 177 1,127 1,449 Consumer open end and junior liens - 13 96 - 97 Total 226 188 273 1,127 1,546 Total nonperforming loans 7,438 8,588 23,683 31,838 31,729 Foreclosed assets: Real estate: Commercial real estate 1,366 2,477 1,138 2,003 2,288 Construction and development 34 1,699 50 97 97 Consumer closed end first mortgage 1,429 3,974 5,757 4,426 2,645 Other loans: Other Consumer 476 283 755 849 1,078 Commercial business - - - 17 19 Total foreclosed assets 3,305 8,433 7,700 7,392 6,127 Non-performing investments - - - - - Total non-performing assets $10,743 $17,021 $31,383 $39,230 $37,856 Total as a percentage of total assets 0.75% 1.22% 2.21% 2.75% 2.69% (1) Includes non-performing troubled debt restructurings. 17 For the year ended December 31, 2014, gross interest income that would have been recorded had the non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $350,000. The amount included in interest income on these loans for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $249,000. See Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Financial Condition at December 31, 2014 Compared to December 31, 2013 - Delinquencies and Non-performing Assets” for more information on our nonperforming assets. Other Loans of Concern. In addition to the non-performing assets set forth in the table above, as of December 31, 2014, there was an aggregate of $5.7 million of loans with respect to which known information about the possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms, which may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the non-performing asset categories. These loans have been considered in management’s determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. Management reviews each of these relationships at least quarterly to determine if further downgrades and specific loan allocations are prudent. Included in the $5.7 million above are 13 commercial real estate loans totaling $4.9 million, two construction and development loans totaling $659,000, and six commercial business loans totaling $91,000. Classified Assets. Our regulators require that we classify loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the board of directors. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by our regulators, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. In connection with the filing of the Bank’s periodic reports with the FDIC and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 18 On the basis of management’s review, at December 31, 2014, we had classified $26.2 million of the Bank’s assets as substandard or doubtful; including $2.9 million in substandard investments, $3.3 million in other real estate owned and repossessed assets, $19.6 million in substandard loans, and $441,000 in doubtful loans. The total amount classified represented 20.6% of our stockholders’ equity and 1.8% of our assets at December 31, 2014, compared to 31.4% and 2.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2013. Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded a provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $850,000, compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The provision for loan losses decreased in 2014 due to decreases in our non-performing and troubled loans, which warranted a decrease in our allowance for loan losses. Net charge-offs decreased to $1.1 million in 2014 compared to $3.9 million in 2013. The provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed below under “Allowance for Loan Losses.” Allowance for Loan Losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements, including the general allowance and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments. In addition, the allowance incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as provided in FASB ASC 310, Receivables. These accounting standards prescribe the measurement methods, income recognition and disclosures related to impaired loans. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. The general allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk evaluation of such loans or pools of loans. Changes in risk evaluations of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the general allowance. Loss factors are based on our historical loss experience as well as on significant factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed by management based upon its evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas and other conditions, such as credit quality trends (including trends in non-performing loans expected to result from existing conditions), collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions within portfolio segments and recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan. Senior management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management’s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management’s evaluation of the loss related to this condition is reflected in the general allowance for loan losses. The evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments. 19 The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. Our methodology as described permits adjustments to any loss factor used in the computation of the general allowance in the event that, in management’s judgment, significant factors which affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date are not reflected in the loss factors. By assessing the probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis, we are able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon any more recent information that has become available. Although the economy is stabilizing in the communities we serve and unemployment rates have improved compared to recent years, management has concluded that our allowance for loan losses should be greater than historical loss experience and specifically identified losses would otherwise indicate. This is while we continue to wait for the market to fully recover and partially due to the increase in higher risk loans like consumer and commercial, as a percentage of total loans. At December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses was $13.2 million, or 1.3% of the total loan portfolio, and approximately 177.0% of total non-performing loans. Our allowance for loan losses balance decreased 1.8% from December 31, 2013. Assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that are susceptible to significant change. In the opinion of management, the allowance, when taken as a whole, is adequate to absorb reasonable estimated loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. 20 The following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses.

It also may invest in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and certain mutual funds. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the management of our investment portfolio, subject to the direction and guidance of the Asset and Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer considers various factors when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases. 21 The objectives of our investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. See “Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”. Our investment securities currently consist of U.S. Agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal securities and corporate obligations. Our mortgage-backed securities portfolio currently consists of securities issued under government-sponsored agency programs. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. While mortgage-backed securities carry a reduced credit risk as compared to whole loans, these securities remain subject to the risk that a fluctuating interest rate environment, along with other factors like the geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of the mortgage loans and affect both the prepayment speed and value of the securities. Although the Bank has not had a trading portfolio in recent history, we are permitted by the Board of Directors to have a trading portfolio of up to $5.0 million and to trade up to $2.0 million in these securities at any one time. At December 31, 2014, however, we did not have a trading portfolio. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. A majority of MutualBank’s investment portfolio is under the management of its wholly owned subsidiary, Mutual Federal Investment Company. Mutual Federal Investment Company, a Nevada corporation, holds, services, manages and invests that portion of the Bank’s investment portfolio as may be transferred from time to time by the Bank to Mutual Federal Investment Company. Mutual Federal Investment Company’s investment policy, for the most part, mirrors that of the Bank. Mutual Federal Investment Company has hired a third party investment advisor to manage its securities portfolio, subject to the oversight of their Board of Directors. At December 31, 2014, MutualBank had $260.8 million in consolidated investment securities. The portfolio is comprised of available for sale securities. At that date, Mutual Federal Investment Company managed $231.8 million of the total available for sale portfolio. The following table sets forth the composition of our investment and mortgage-related securities portfolio and our other investments at the dates indicated. As of December 31, 2014, our investment securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity capital, excluding those issued by the United States Government or its agencies. 22 December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value (Dollars in thousands) Investment securities available-for-sale: Mortgage-backed securities $110,452 $113,290 $104,006 $103,517 $121,260 $126,375 Collateralized mortgage obligations 97,325 97,759 108,305 107,578 114,782 118,235 Federal agencies 4 4 5,005 4,774 13,008 13,014 Municipal obligations 27,246 29,252 27,357 27,338 3,129 3,264 Corporate obligations 21,763 20,501 24,648 21,141 24,147 20,309 Total investment securities held for sale 256,790 260,806 269,321 264,348 276,326 281,197 Investment in limited partnerships 1,582 N/A 2,092 N/A 2,603 N/A Federal Home Loan Bank stock 11,964 N/A 14,391 N/A 14,391 N/A Total investments $270,336 $260,806 $285,804 $264,348 $293,320 $281,197 The following table indicates, as of December 31, 2014, the composition and maturities of our investment securities, excluding Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock.

During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we did not recognize any OTTI on our investments. In 2014, the Bank sold six of the securities with previously recorded OTTI. Only one security in the portfolio continues to be deemed impaired as of December 31, 2014. The remaining two trust preferred securities were priced using a discounted cash flow analysis as of December 31, 2014. 23 Pooled Trust Preferred Securities. The Company has invested in pooled trust preferred securities. At December 31, 2014, the current par balance of our pooled trust preferred securities was $3.8 million. The original par value of these securities was $4.0 million prior to the OTTI write-downs in 2011 and earlier, based on valuations by a third party. OTTI taken on trust preferred securities prior to 2014 was the result of deterioration in the performance of the underlying collateral. The deterioration was the result of increased defaults and deferrals of dividend payments in the current year, creating credit impairment along with weakening financial performance of performing collateral, increasing the risk of future deferrals of dividends and defaults. No additional OTTI was determined in 2014. All pooled trust preferred securities owned by the Bank are exempt from the Volcker Rule. The following table provides additional information related to the Bank’s investment in trust preferred securities as of December 31, 2014.

A 15% recovery is applied to all projected defaults by insurance companies. No recovery is applied to current defaults. (2)Excess subordination represents the additional defaults in excess of both current and projected defaults that the CDO can absorb before the bond experiences any credit impairment. Excess subordinated percentage is calculated by (a) determining what percentage of defaults a deal can experience before the bond has credit impairment, and (b) subtracting from this default breakage percentage both total current and expected future default percentages. 24 The Bank’s trust preferred securities valuation was prepared by an independent third party. Their approach for determining fair value involved several steps including: (1) a detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in the trust preferred securities; (2) collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the trust preferred security; (3) terms of the trust preferred structure, as laid out in the indenture; and (4) discounted cash flow modeling. The Company uses market-based yield indicators as a baseline for determining appropriate discount rates, and then adjusts the resulting discount rates on the basis of its credit and structural analysis of specific trust preferred securities. The primary focus is on the returns a fixed income investor would require in order to allocate capital on a risk adjusted basis. There is currently no active market for pooled trust preferred securities; however, the Company looks principally to market yields for stand-alone trust preferred securities issued by banks, thrifts and insurance companies for which there is an active and liquid market. The next step is to make a series of adjustments to reflect the differences that exist between these products (both credit and structural) and, most importantly, to reflect idiosyncratic credit performance differences (both actual and projected) between these products and the underlying collateral in the specific trust preferred security. Importantly, as part of the analysis described above, MutualFirst considers the fact that structured instruments frequently exhibit leverage not present in stand-alone instruments, and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect this additional risk. The default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral were formed based on the evaluation of the collateral credit and a review of historical industry default data and current/near-term operating conditions. For collateral that has already defaulted, the Company assumed no recovery. For collateral that was in deferral, the Company assumed a recovery of 10% of par for banks, thrifts or other depository institutions, and 15% of par for insurance companies. Although the Company conservatively assumed that the majority of the deferring collateral continues to defer and eventually defaults, we also recognize there is a possibility that some deferring collateral may become current at some point in the future. Investments in Limited Partnerships. MutualBank has investments in eight Indiana limited partnerships that were organized to construct, own and operate two multi-unit apartment complexes in the Indianapolis area, one in Findley, Ohio, two in Goshen, Indiana, one in Elkhart, Indiana, and two in Niles, Michigan (the Pedcor Projects). The general partner in each of these Pedcor Projects is Pedcor Investments. All of the Pedcor Projects are operated as multi-family, low and moderate-income housing projects and have been performing as planned for several years. A low-and-moderate income housing project qualifies for certain federal income tax credits if it is a residential rental property, the units are used on a non-transient basis, and at least 20% of the units in the project are occupied by tenants whose incomes are 50% or less of the area median gross income, adjusted for family size, or alternatively, at least 40% of the units in the project are occupied by tenants whose incomes are 60% or less of the area median gross income. Qualified low-income housing projects generally must comply with these and other rules for 15 years, beginning with the first year the project qualified for the tax credit, or some or all of the tax credit together with interest may be recaptured. The tax credit is subject to the limitation for use as a general business credit, but no basis reduction is required for any portion of the tax credit claimed. As of December 31, 2014, at least 91.7% of the units in the Pedcor Projects were occupied, and all of the tenants met the income test required for the tax credits. One of the eight projects continues to provide tax credits to the Bank. 25 We received tax credits totaling $107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, $159,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $283,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012 from the Pedcor Projects. The Pedcor Projects continue to incur operating losses. We have accounted for our investments in the Pedcor Projects on the equity method. Accordingly, we have recorded our share of these losses as reductions to MutualBank’s investments in the Pedcor Projects. Of the eight investments in Pedcor projects, the Bank has written three projects down to zero and received tax credits on three projects. The following summarizes MutualBank’s equity in the Pedcor Projects’ losses and tax credits recognized in our consolidated financial statements.

Sources of Funds General. Our sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, payment of principal and interest on loans, interest earned on or maturation of other investment securities and funds provided from operations. Deposits. We offer deposit accounts to consumers and businesses having a wide range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of savings deposit accounts, NOW and demand accounts and certificates of deposit. We solicit deposits in our market areas as well as online through our internet banking product. We primarily rely on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits. Occasionally we will accept brokered deposits from a broker but only if no fee is paid. At December 31, 2014, our brokered deposits totaled $27.2 million, or 2.5% of total deposits, with an average interest rate of 1.58% and a 2.6 year weighted-average maturity. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates, and competition. The variety of our deposit accounts has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond to changes in consumer demand. We have become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows, as customers have continued to deposit in short-term products while rates remain low. We try to manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset/liability management, liquidity and profitability objectives, subject to competitive factors. Based on our experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. Our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on those deposits has been and will continue to be affected significantly by economic and market conditions. 26 The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts. At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with these reserve requirements. The following table sets forth the dollar amount of savings deposits in the various types of deposit programs we offered at the dates indicated.

Borrowings. We also utilize borrowings as a source of funds, especially when they are less costly than deposits and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand or when they meet our asset/liability management goals. Our borrowings historically have consisted of advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We may obtain advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis upon the pledging of certain collateral. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features. At December 31, 2014 we had $192.4 million in FHLB advances outstanding. Based on current collateral levels, we could borrow an additional $105.9 million from the FHLB at prevailing interest rates. In order to have access to FHLB advances, we are required to own stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis. At December 31, 2014, we had $12.0 million in that stock. 28 In 2013, the Company borrowed $7.6 million from First Tennessee Bank, N.A. to refinance existing long-term debt. The loan was originated at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.80%; however the Company entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the rate of the note at 3.92%. The balance of the loan at December 31, 2014 was $6.1 million and matures in December 2017. We also are authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s “discount window.” We have never borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank and currently do not have any assets pledged to them for borrowing. The Bank also has two fed fund lines totaling $15 million. There was no outstanding balance on either of these lines as of December 31, 2014. The Company acquired $5.0 million of issuer trust preferred securities in the 2008 acquisition of another financial institution. The net balance of these securities as of December 31, 2014 was $4.1 million due to the purchase accounting adjustment made at the time of the acquisition. The securities bore a fixed rate of interest of 6.22% for the first five years, resetting quarterly thereafter at the prevailing three-month LIBOR rate plus 170 basis points. In December 2009, the Company entered into a cash flow hedge with FTN Financial to fix the floating portion of the issued trust preferred security at 5.15% for the next five years starting on September 15, 2010. The Company has had the right to redeem the trust preferred securities, in whole or in part, without penalty, since September 15, 2010. These securities mature on September 15, 2035. The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the maximum month-end balance and average balance of FHLB advances and other borrowings.

Trust and Financial Services MutualWealth and MutualFinancial Advisors are the wealth management and brokerage divisions of the Bank that provide a variety of fee-based financial services, including trust, investment, insurance, broker advisory, retirement plan and private banking services, in our market areas. Trust services are provided to both individual and corporate customers, including personal trust and agency accounts, employee benefit plans and corporate bond trustee accounts. These activities provide a significant source of fee income to the Company and in 2014 constituted 33.0% of the Company’s non-interest income. Subsidiary and Other Activities As an Indiana commercial bank, MutualBank is allowed to invest in subsidiaries as authorized by Indiana law and the IDFI. Under FDIC regulations, those subsidiaries generally may only engage in activities as principal that are permissible for national bank subsidiaries, unless the Bank receives FDIC approval to engage in other activities permitted by Indiana law and the IDFI. Activities engaged in as agent, including insurance agency activities, are not subject to this FDIC limitation. The Bank's insurance agency subsidiary, Mishawaka Financial Services, Inc., is engaged in the sale, as agent, of life insurance and credit-life and health insurance to the Bank's customers and the general public. At December 31, 2014, MutualBank had an active investment subsidiary, Mutual Federal Investment Company, which is a Nevada corporation that holds and manages a portion of MutualBank’s investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, the market value of securities managed was $234.6 million. Mutual Federal Investment Company has one active subsidiary, Mutual Federal REIT, Inc., which is a Maryland corporation holding approximately $44.6 million in consumer closed end first mortgage loans. The Bank had one other active subsidiary as of December 31, 2014. Summit Service Corporation is the service corporation that controls the 100% wholly owned active subsidiary, Summit Mortgage, Inc., which is an Indiana corporation that originates and sells consumer closed end first mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2014, the corporation had $3.4 million in loans held for sale. 30 Employees At December 31, 2014, we had a total of 381 full-time and 57 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its employee relations to be good. How We Are Regulated MutualBank is an Indiana commercial bank subject to regulation by the IDFI and the FDIC, and the Company is a bank holding company subject to FRB regulation. The Dodd Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has authority to promulgate regulations intended to protect consumers with respect to financial products and services, including those provided by the Bank, and to restrict unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct by providers of consumer financial products and services. The FDIC regulates the Bank under these regulations. As a public company, the Company is subject to the regulation and reporting requirements of the SEC. Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that apply to us. This description, as well as other descriptions of laws and regulations contained in this Form 10-K, is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress and the Indiana General Assembly that may affect our operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the IDFI, the FDIC, CFPB, FRB or the SEC, as appropriate. Any legislative or regulatory changes in the future, including those resulting from the Dodd Frank Act, could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. MutualFirst. MutualFirst is a bank holding company subject to regulatory oversight by the FRB. MutualFirst is required to register and file reports with the FRB and is subject to regulation and examination by the FRB, including regulations requiring that the Company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for the Bank, particularly if the Bank is in financial distress. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Company and any of its non-bank subsidiaries. The Company’s direct activities and those of non-bank subsidiaries are subject to FRB regulation and must be closely related to banking, as determined by the FRB. The Company must obtain FRB approval to acquire substantially all the assets of another bank or bank holding company or to merge with another bank holding company. In addition, the Company must obtain FRB authorization to control more than 5% of the shares of any other bank or bank holding company and may not own more than 5% of any other entity engaged in activities not permitted for the Company. The IDFI also has oversight authority over the Company including acquisitions of other Indiana banks or bank holding companies and transactions with the Bank. The FRB imposes consolidated capital requirements on the Company. See “- Regulatory Capital Requirements” and “New Capital Regulations.” 31 MutualBank. As an Indiana commercial bank, MutualBank is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the IDFI. Indiana law and the IDFI extensively regulate many aspects of the Bank’s operations including branching, dividends, interest and fees collected, anti-money laundering activities, confidentiality of customer information, credit card operations, corporate governance, mergers and purchase and assumption transactions, insurance activities, securities investments, real estate investments, trust operations, lending activities, subsidiary operations and required capital levels. Under Indiana law, Indiana banks may have parity authority with national banks. To fund its operations, the IDFI has established a schedule for the assessment of “supervisory fees” for all Indiana financial institutions. These supervisory fees are computed based on the Bank’s total assets and trust assets and increase if the Bank experiences financial distress. The IDFI also charges fees for certain applications and other filings. The Bank’s primary federal regulator is the FDIC. See “- FDIC Regulation and Insurance of Accounts.” FDIC Regulation and Insurance of Accounts. As a state-chartered, non-member bank, MutualBank is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the FDIC. The FDIC does not assess fees for its examination and supervision of the Bank. The FDIC oversees the Bank’s operations under federal law, regulations and policies, including consumer compliance laws, and ensures that the Bank operates in a safe and sound manner. It regulates the Bank’s branching, transactions with affiliates (including the Company) and loans to insiders. Under FDIC regulations, the Bank generally is prohibited from acquiring or owning any equity investments impermissible for national banks and from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks without FDIC approval. During examinations, the FDIC may require the Bank to establish additional reserves for loan losses, which would decrease the Company’s net income. The FDIC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the FDIC, and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. The basic deposit insurance level is $250,000 per each separately insured depositor, as defined in FDIC regulations. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. Our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $1.0 million. Those premiums may increase due to strains on the FDIC deposit insurance fund due to the cost of bank failures. Also, if the Bank’s regulatory capital or supervisory ratings deteriorate, these deposit premiums may increase. 32 In accordance with the Dodd Frank Act, the FDIC has issued regulations setting insurance premium assessments based on an institution's total assets minus its Tier 1 capital instead of its deposits. The Bank’s FDIC premiums are based on its assignment under one of four risk categories based on the Bank’s capital, supervisory ratings and other factors. In order to improve the FDIC deposit insurance fund’s reserve ratio (the ratio of the net worth of the deposit insurance fund to estimated insured deposits) and address anticipated strains on the fund, the FDIC required each insured institution to prepay at the end of 2009 the estimated amount of its assessments through the end of 2012. We began paying regular deposit insurance premiums in 2013. Federal law requires that the reserve ratio of the FDIC deposit insurance fund be at least 1.35% by September 2020, and the FDIC has established a plan to meet that requirement. It also may prohibit the Bank from engaging in any activity that it determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund and may terminate our deposit insurance if it determines that we have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or are in an unsafe or unsound condition. Regulatory Capital Requirements. Both MutualFirst and MutualBank are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. The FDIC has established capital standards for the Bank, including a leverage ratio and a risk-based capital requirement, as well as capital standards for purposes of establishing the threshold for taking prompt corrective action against capital deficient institutions. The FDIC also may impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. The FRB has established similar leverage and risk-based capital requirements for the Company. See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Capital Resources” for information on the Company’s and the Bank’s compliance with these capital requirements. Under the FDIC capital regulations, the Bank must maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of 4% Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets, excluding intangibles. The FDIC can require a higher leverage capital ratio on an individualized basis if it determines the Bank is exposed to undue or excessive risk. The Bank also must meet a minimum risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% qualifying total capital (at least 50% Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital, which includes the loan loss allowance, up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets) to risk-weighted assets (most balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet assets weighted 0% to 100% based on relevant risks of types of assets). Under prompt corrective action standards, the FDIC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The FDIC is generally required to restrict the activities of an “undercapitalized institution,” which is a bank with less than either a 4% leverage capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 risked-based capital ratio or an 8.0% risk-based capital ratio. Any such institution must submit a capital restoration plan and, until such plan is approved by the FDIC, may not increase its assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or engage in any new activities, and generally may not make capital distributions. Any bank that has a Tier 1 risk-based or leverage capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% is considered “significantly undercapitalized” and must be made subject to one or more additional specified actions and operating restrictions that may cover all aspects of its operations and may include a forced merger or acquisition of the institution. A bank that becomes “critically undercapitalized” because it has a tangible equity capital ratio of 2.0% or less is subject to further restrictions on its activities in addition to those applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. In addition, a receiver or conservator must be appointed, with certain limited exceptions, within 90 days after a bank becomes critically undercapitalized. 33 To be considered well-capitalized under the current prompt corrective action standards, a bank must have at least a 5% leverage capital ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10% total risk-based capital ratio and no enforceable individualized capital requirement. Banks that are not well-capitalized are adequately capitalized under these standards until capital ratios fall to the under capitalized level. Once a bank is not well-capitalized it generally may not accept brokered deposits and is subject to limits on the rates it offers on deposits. See “New Capital Rules.” The FRB has established similar capital ratio requirements that apply to bank holding companies, including the Company, on a consolidated basis. To be considered well-capitalized a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, at least a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% and not a higher enforceable individualized capital requirement. Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), the Company and the Bank will be subject to new capital regulations adopted by the FRB and the FDIC, which create a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, increase the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, change the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, create an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios, and change what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless we elect to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, as discussed below; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. There are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 will be deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital will include AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. Because of our asset size, we have the one-time option of deciding in the first quarter of 2015 whether to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We are considering whether to elect this option. 34 The new requirements also include changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Company and the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets will be required, which amount will increase each year until the buffer requirement is fully implemented on January 1, 2019. The FDIC’s prompt corrective action standards change when these new capital regulations become effective. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% (new), a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8% (increased from 6%), a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10% (unchanged), and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged); and in order to be considered adequately capitalized, it must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Although we continue to evaluate the impact that the new capital rules will have on the Company and the Bank, we anticipate that the Company and the Bank will remain well-capitalized under the new capital rules, and will meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions. The Company’s major source of funds consists of dividends from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends depends on its earnings and capital levels and may be limited by FDIC or IDFI directives or orders. In addition, under Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends from undivided profits; however, in some circumstances it may be required to obtain IDFI approval of a dividend if the total dividends declared during the current year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds net income for the current year and retained net income for the prior two years, which excludes dividends paid during those years. The approval from IDFI is not required if the Bank meets exemption guidelines that mandate minimums for examination ratings and the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, and the Bank is not subject to corrective action or supervisory order agreements. Since the Bank became regulated by the IDFI, they have been exempt from the pre-approval requirements but are still required to notify the IDFI of any proposed dividend. It is the Bank’s policy to maintain a strong capital position, so, in times of financial or economic distress, the Bank will be less likely to pay dividends to the Company. The ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders is dependent on the receipt of dividends from the Bank. Under Maryland law, the Company cannot pay cash dividends if it would render the Company unable to pay its debts or would be insolvent (unless they are paid from recent earnings). 35 The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the FRB’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, a bank holding company may be prohibited from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is not adequately capitalized. A bank holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well-managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. Federal Securities Laws. The common stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, the Company is subject to the reporting, information disclosure, proxy solicitation, insider trading limits and other requirements imposed on public companies by the SEC under the Exchange Act. This includes limits on sales of stock by certain insiders and the filing of insider ownership reports with the SEC. The SEC and Nasdaq have adopted regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that apply to the Company as a Nasdaq-traded, public company, which seek to improve corporate governance, provide enhanced penalties for financial reporting improprieties and improve the reliability of disclosures in SEC filings. Volcker Rule Regulations. Regulations were recently adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of banks and their holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds, and certain other investments, including certain CMOs, CDOs, CLOs and others. The regulations became effective on April 1, 2014 with full compliance being phased in over a period ending on July 21, 2015. We have reviewed our investment portfolio and all currently owned trust preferred securities are exempt from the Volcker Rule regulations. 36 Federal Taxation General. We are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. MutualBank’s federal income tax returns have been closed without audit by the IRS through its year ended December 31, 2010. MutualFirst and MutualBank will file a consolidated federal income tax return for fiscal year 2014. Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to 1998, bad debt reserves created prior to the year ended December 31, 1997 were subject to recapture into taxable income if MutualBank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation eliminated these thrift recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to recapture should MutualBank make certain non-dividend distributions or cease to maintain a bank charter. Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. MutualBank is subject to the alternative minimum tax, and has $1.4 million available as credits for carryover. Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. MutualFirst may eliminate from its income dividends received from MutualBank as a wholly owned subsidiary of MutualFirst if it elects to file a consolidated return with MutualBank. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100% or 80%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payer of the dividend. Corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. State Taxation MutualBank is subject to Indiana’s financial institutions tax, which is imposed at a flat rate of 8.0% on “adjusted gross income” apportioned to Indiana. “Adjusted gross income,” for purposes of the financial institutions tax, begins with taxable income as defined by Section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and incorporates federal tax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several Indiana modifications including only considering members of the combined group which have Indiana nexus. Indiana legislature has reduced the financial institutions tax from 8.5% to 6.5% in 0.5% increments over the next four years. The full change will be effective at the end of 2017. Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes. The Company is subject to a Michigan business tax on apportioned capital employed in the state of Michigan. The Company also files the Pennsylvania Bank & Trust Company shares and loans tax report. Ultimately, this tax is based on apportioned adjusted capital in the state of Pennsylvania. 37 Internet Website We maintain a website with the address of www.bankwithmutual.com.

Risk Factors The following are certain risk factors that could impact our business, financial results and results of operations. Investing in our common stock involves risks, including those described below. These risk factors should be considered by prospective and current investors in our common stock when evaluating the disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly the forward-looking statements). These risk factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. If any of the events in the following risks actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe are immaterial do materialize, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks. The recent economic recession was severe in our primary market area of northern and east central Indiana, which is not a high growth market. If those local economic conditions do not continue to improve, our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted adversely as borrowers’ ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing loans decreases. A return of recessionary conditions could result in further increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and in our local market area. These conditions are impacted by changes to short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, monetary supply, consumer confidence and spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the economy in the United States generally and in our primary market area in particular. The economy continues to recover from the recent severe recession, which caused high unemployment levels, declining real estate values and eroded consumer confidence. The recession also reduced demand for commercial business and real estate loans in our local market. Declines in real estate values and other effects of the recession impacted household and corporate incomes, impairing the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and increasing our non-performing loans, loan charge-offs, provisions for loan losses and foreclosures. 38 Substantially all of our loans are located in northern and east central Indiana, which was impacted by the recession more severely than the national average. Our primary market area, which consists of Allen, Delaware, Elkhart, Grant, Kosciusko, Randolph, St. Joseph and Wabash counties in Indiana and Berrien county in Michigan, has experienced limited population growth of 0.64% from 2000 through 2010. This data from the census bureau reflects population increases in our northern region market of 2.02% compared to the reduction in population of our central region of (3.04%). Unemployment levels in our Indiana market dropped below the state level as of the end of 2014. According to data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, the national unemployment rate for the United States at December 31, 2014 was 5.6% (seasonally adjusted) compared to an average rate of 5.7% (not seasonally adjusted) for our market areas in Indiana. See “Item 1 - Business - Market Area.” A return of recessionary conditions and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further declines in real estate values and sales volumes and continued high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition. Stock prices for financial institution holding companies, including MutualFirst, would be expected to decline substantially, and it would be significantly more difficult to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets. A substantial portion of our assets consist of various types of loans that carry varying levels of credit and interest rate risk and that are sensitive to changes in the local and national economies. Loans Secured by Residential Property. At December 31, 2014, $594.3 million, or 57.8% of our total loan portfolio, was secured by one- to four-family residential property, including loans held for sale and home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. The decline in residential real estate values as a result of the downturn in the Indiana housing markets has reduced the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increased the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans. In addition, borrowers seeking to sell their homes may find that they cannot sell their properties for an amount equal to or greater than the unpaid principal loan balance. Though the housing market in Indiana continued to experience some improvement in 2014, a return to declines in real estate sales and the home values may result in higher than expected residential loan delinquencies or problem assets, a decline in demand for our products and services, or lack of growth or a decrease in deposits. These potential negative events may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital and liquidity and damage our financial condition and business operations. 39 Commercial Real Estate, Construction and Development and Commercial Business Loans. At December 31, 2014, $319.6 million of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate, construction and development and commercial business loans to small and mid-sized businesses the predominantly in our primary market area, which are the types of businesses that have a heightened vulnerability to local economic conditions. Though the recent recession has slowed our growth in this lending area since 2008, the Company did have growth in the commercial portfolio in 2014. At December 31, 2014, our loan portfolio included $33.1 million of commercial construction and development loans, $198.0 million of commercial real estate loans and $88.5 million of commercial business loans compared to $13.3 million, $200.8 million and $75.4 million for construction and development, commercial real estate and business loans, respectively, at December 31, 2013. Although we have seen a stabilization in the portfolio in 2014 and a reduction in non-performing loans, a decline in property values and other market impacts could lead to an increase in non-performing loans. See “Item 1 - Business of MutualBank - Asset Quality - Non-Performing Assets.” The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one- to four-family residential loans because the repayment of multifamily and commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrowers’ business and the real estate securing the loans as collateral, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions. Any delinquent payments or the failure to repay these loans would hurt our earnings. Additionally, commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Several of our commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or business loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to any one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Finally, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral, if any, is typically longer than a one- to four-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could require us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Other Consumer Loans. At December 31, 2014, $114.7 million, or 11.2% of our total loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans, of which $14.7 million consisted of automobile loans, $94.8 million consisted of boat/RV loans and $5.2 million consisted of other consumers loans, including unsecured lines of credit. Generally, we consider these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner-occupied residential properties, particularly in the case of loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Although our indirect loans, which totaled $90.8 million at December 31, 2014, were underwritten by a third party using our guidelines, they were primarily originated to customers outside of our normal lending area which present greater risks than other types of lending activities. As a result of this portfolio of consumer loans, it may become necessary to increase the level of our provision for loan losses, which could hurt our profits. 40 Adjustable Rate Loans. At December 31, 2014, $371.8 million, or 36.1% of our total loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate loans. Borrowers with adjustable rate loans are exposed to increased monthly payments when the related interest rate adjusts upward under the terms of the loan to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin. Any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable-rate loans, increasing the possibility of default. Borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly payments by refinancing their loans may no longer be able to find available replacement loans at comparably lower interest rates. In addition, declining real estate prices may prevent refinancing or a sale of the property, because borrowers have insufficient equity in the real estate. These events, alone or in combination, may contribute to higher delinquency rates and negatively impact our earnings. If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses or our non-performing assets increase, our earnings will suffer. Increases in our provision for loan losses adversely impact our earnings and operations. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience and evaluate current economic conditions. Management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, resulting in additions to our allowance. Additions to our allowance decrease our net income. Our regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review. These increases in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our allowance for loan losses was 1.30% of gross loans and 177.04% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2014, compared to 1.37% of gross loans and 156.15% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2013 and 1.63% of gross loans and 67.72% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2014, our non-performing assets (which consist of non-accrual loans, loans 90 days or more delinquent, non-accrual troubled debt restructurings and foreclosed real estate assets) totaled $10.7 million, which was a decrease of $6.3 million, or a 36.9% reduction in non-performing assets from December 31, 2013. This decrease reflects improved economic conditions within our market areas. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or real estate owned. We must reserve for estimated credit losses, which are established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, if appropriate, we must write down the value of properties in our REO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs including taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our REO. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, potentially distracting them from the overall supervision of our operations and other income-producing activities. 41 During 2014, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $850,000 compared to $1.3 million in 2013 and $6.0 million for 2012. We also recorded net loan charge-offs of $1.1 million in 2014, compared to $3.9 million in 2013 and $6.8 million in 2012. During 2014, we experienced less loan delinquencies and credit losses than in 2013 and 2012, due to improved economic conditions. If declining trends in the housing, real estate and local business markets return, we would expect increased levels of delinquencies and credit losses to return, which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and financial condition are affected significantly by changes in interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Because interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income. Changes in interest rates also may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates or continuing low interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we have been and continue to be subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. Also, increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed-rate assets, which could limit the funds we have available to reinvest in higher-yielding alternatives, and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher market interest rates. Changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2014, the fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale securities totaled $260.8 million. Gross unrealized gains on these securities totaled $6.3 million, while gross unrealized losses on these securities totaled $2.2 million, resulting in a net unrealized gain of $4.1 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2014, our interest rate risk analysis indicated that our net portfolio value would decrease by 12.8% if there was an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates. See the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Asset/Liability Management.” 42 Our strategies to modify our interest rate risk profile may be difficult to implement. Our asset/liability management strategies are designed to decrease our interest rate risk sensitivity. One such strategy is to increase the amount of adjustable rate and/or short-term assets. The Bank offers adjustable rate loan products as a means to achieve this strategy. The availability of lower rates on fixed-rate loans has generally created a decrease in borrower demand for adjustable rate assets. Additionally, these adjustable-rate assets may prepay. At December 31, 2014, 36.1% of our loan portfolio consisted of adjustable-rate loans, compared to 35.3% at December 31, 2013. We also are managing our liabilities to moderate our interest rate risk sensitivity. Customer demand is primarily for short-term certificates of deposit and transaction accounts. Using short-term liabilities to fund long-term, fixed-rate assets will increase the interest rate sensitivity of any financial institution. When needed, we are utilizing FHLB advances and repurchase agreements to mitigate the impact of customer demand by lengthening the maturities of these advances or entering into longer term repurchase agreements, depending on liquidity or investment opportunities. FHLB advances and repurchase agreements are entered into as liquidity is needed or to fund assets that provide for a spread considered sufficient by management. If we are unable to originate adjustable rate assets at favorable rates or fund loan originations or securities purchases with long-term advances or structured borrowings, we may have difficulty executing this asset/liability management strategy and/or it may result in a reduction in profitability. OTTI charges in our investment securities portfolio could result in losses and adversely affect our continuing operations. Our securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Our securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings, which may materially adversely affect our stockholders’ equity, regulatory capital and continuing operations. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by decreases in interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand, as well as the default rates of specific financial institutions whose securities provide the underlying collateral for these securities and changes in credit risk based on the condition of the issuer. The valuation of our investment securities also is influenced by the implementation of Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance on fair value accounting, which requires us to report our available-for-sale securities at their estimated fair value. We increase or decrease our stockholders’ equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. At December 31, 2014, the change in unrealized gains on securities available for sale from the level at December 31, 2013 was an increase of $9.0 million. The current market environment significantly limits our ability to mitigate our exposure to valuation changes in these securities by selling them. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI on at least a quarterly basis. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. We did not record any OTTI in 2014, 2013 or 2012. In 2014, we sold six of the seven securities in which we had previously recognized OTTI. As of December 31, 2014, we only have one security remaining in our portfolio that has been deemed impaired. 43 If our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses, or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves, our earnings could be reduced. We obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as real estate owned (“REO”), and at certain other times during the assets holding period. Our net book value (“NBV”) in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (fair value). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset’s NBV over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, the fair value of our investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our NBV in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs. Additional material charge-offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our regulators periodically review our REO and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Any increase in our charge-offs, as required by our regulator, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We face risks related to covenants in our loan sales to investors and secondary mortgage market conditions. Our agreements with investors to sell our loans generally contain covenants that require us to repurchase loans under certain circumstances, including some delinquencies, or to return premiums paid by those investors if the loans are paid off early. If we are required to repurchase sold loans under these covenants, they may be deemed troubled loans, with the potential for charge-offs and/or loss provision changes, which could impact our earnings and asset quality ratios adversely. The Bank was not required to repurchase any loans from investors during 2014 and two loans in 2013. Our ability to sell loans on the secondary mortgage market is impacted by interest rate changes and investor demand or expected return. If this market becomes less liquid, we may not be able to rely as much on loan sales to reduce our interest rate and credit risk. We use estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets, such as mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”). If our estimates prove to be incorrect, we may be required to write down the value of these assets which could adversely affect our earnings. We sell a portion of our one- to four-family loans in the secondary market. We generally retain the right to service these loans. At December 31, 2014, the value of our MSRs was $1.4 million. We use a financial model that uses, wherever possible, quoted market prices to value our MSRs. This model is complex and also uses assumptions related to interest and discount rates, prepayment speeds, delinquency and foreclosure rates and ancillary fee income. Valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model. The primary risk associated with MSRs is that they will lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments occasioned by declining interest rates. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. If prepayment speeds increase more than estimated or delinquency and default levels are higher than anticipated we may be required to write down the value of our MSRs which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. The Company obtains independent valuations at least semi-annually to determine if impairment in the asset exists. 44 Declining economic conditions may adversely impact the fees generated by our asset management and trust business. To the extent our asset management and trust clients and their assets become adversely impacted by weak economic and stock market conditions, they may choose to withdraw the assets managed by us and/or the value of their assets may decline. Our asset management revenues are based on the value of the assets we manage. If our clients withdraw assets or the value of their assets decline, our revenues from these activities may be adversely affected. These fees totaled $3.5 million and $3.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We face significant operational and reputational risks. As a community bank, maintaining our reputation in our market area is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. Our business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes impacting the banking industry. We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. We operate in many different financial service businesses and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a significant number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees’ execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions, data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Our loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have experienced an increase in losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. Our policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses may not prevent all such losses. 45 Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have national name recognition, greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer certain services or prices for services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. A tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. A tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may affect asset growth, our earnings capability and capital levels negatively. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, including brokered deposits, as well as cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings, especially from the FHLB and repurchase agreements, also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us or a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated. Our ability to borrow also could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations or continued deterioration in credit markets. 46 Our core deposit premium could be deemed partially or fully impaired in the future, which would reduce our earnings and the values of that intangible asset. At December 31, 2014, we had a core deposit premium of $840,000, due mainly to our 2008 acquisition of another financial institution. Under GAAP, we are required to periodically assess the value of this intangible asset based on a number of factors to determine if there is partial or full impairment. The factors taken into consideration include the market price of our stock, the net present value of our assets and liabilities and valuation information for similar financial institutions. This evaluation involves a substantial amount of judgment. If actual conditions underlying the factors differ from our assessment, the core deposit intangible could be subjected to faster amortization or partial or complete impairment, which would reduce the value of this asset and reduce our earnings, perhaps materially. We currently hold a significant amount of bank-owned life insurance. At December 31, 2014, we held $93.2 million of bank-owned life insurance or BOLI on key employees and executives, with a cash surrender value of $51.0 million. These policies are maintained to fund amounts owed under executive supplemental retirement plans. The eventual repayment of the cash surrender value is subject to the ability of the various insurance companies to pay death benefits or to return the cash surrender value to us if needed for liquidity purposes. We continually monitor the financial strength of the various companies with whom we carry these policies. However, any one of these companies could experience a decline in financial strength, which could impair its ability to pay benefits or return our cash surrender value. If we need to liquidate these policies for liquidity purposes, we would be subject to taxation on the increase in cash surrender value and penalties for early termination, both of which would adversely impact earnings. We may not be able to fully realize our deferred tax asset. At December 31, 2014, we had a $13.3 million deferred income tax benefit based on differences between the financial statement amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and reflecting mainly an allowance for loan loss timing difference and business tax and AMT carryover. The value of our deferred income tax benefit is reviewed regularly under various forecasts and assumptions, including anticipated levels of taxable net income, to determine the likelihood of realizing the benefit. If actual results or subsequent forecasts differ from our current judgments, to the extent that it becomes more likely than not that this benefit will not be fully realized, we would have to write down this asset, which would negatively impact results of operations and reduce our asset size. 47 If our investment in the FHLB of Indianapolis becomes impaired, our earnings and stockholders’ equity could decrease. At December 31, 2014, we owned $12.0 million in FHLB of Indianapolis stock. We are required to own this stock to be a member of and to obtain advances from our FHLB. This stock is not marketable and can only be redeemed by our FHLB. The most recent stock buyback initiated by FHLB was in 2014 to repurchase some excess member stock, and we reduced our holdings by $2.4 million at that time. Our FHLB’s financial condition is linked, in part, to the eleven other members of the FHLB System and to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their capital, which would cause our FHLB stock to be deemed impaired, resulting in a decrease in our earnings and assets. Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income. The Bank and the Company are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state regulators, which has extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank’s operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank’s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any change in these regulations and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations. See “Item 1 - How We Are Regulated.” In response to the recent financial crisis, Congress took actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions, and the FDIC has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB which has broad authority to issue regulations governing the services and products we provide consumers. This additional regulation could increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely impact our operations. That legislation also contains provisions that, over time, could result in the need for more regulatory capital requirements and loan loss provisions for the Company and the Bank and may increase interest expense due to the ability to pay interest on all demand deposits. In the recent economic downturn, federal and state banking regulators have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements. The FDIC and IDFI govern the activities in which the Bank may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection or benefit of stockholders. In addition, new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Recent regulatory changes regarding card interchange fee income does not currently apply to us but could change in the future. Prior year changes in overdraft protection programs decreased the amount of fees we receive for those services. During 2014, overdraft protection and nonsufficient fund fees totaled $2.1 million. Further, legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor. 48 Increases in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments will negatively impact our earnings. The Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% of total insured deposits as the minimum reserve ratio for the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund effective September 30, 2020. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by the statutory deadline and anticipates reaching a 1.15% ratio by 2018. Once the 1.15% ratio is reached, which was the minimum ratio prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% on institutions with assets less than $10 billion. The FDIC has not announced how it will implement this offset. In addition to the statutory minimum ratio, the FDIC must set a designated reserve ratio or DRR, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has set 2.0% as the DRR. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted final regulations under which insurance premiums are based on an institution's total assets minus its tangible equity instead of its deposits. Since the implementation of these changes, we have seen a decline in our deposit insurance premiums. The insurance costs were $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our future deposit insurance premiums may increase if the FDIC determines that it will not meet the required or anticipated minimum reserve ratios discussed, which could have a negative impact on our earnings. Our accounting policies and methods impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Application of these policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. These accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They may require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our controls and procedures may be ineffective. We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. As a result, we may incur increased costs to maintain and improve our controls and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls or procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 49 System failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities. The computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful. Though the third party vendors providing key components of our business infrastructure have been carefully chosen by us, we cannot control their actions, and their failures may impact the Bank’s ability to provide services to its customers and cause us to incur significant expense. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. We may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed. We are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise more capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital. In that regard, a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital in response to a deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market, deteriorating economic conditions, declines in real estate values and other factors. Should we be required by regulatory authorities to raise additional capital, we may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or preferred stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or convertible securities to new stockholders would be dilutive to our current stockholders. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or if the terms of such a capital raise are not advantageous, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 50 There may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. Our board of directors is authorized to allow us to issue additional common stock, as well as classes or series of preferred stock, generally without any action on the part of the stockholders. In addition, the board has the power, generally without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market value of the common stock could be adversely affected. Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders. Provisions in our charter and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Maryland and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of any class of our equity securities, including our common stock. These provisions include: a prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of 10% of total shares outstanding, supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns more than 10% of our outstanding common stock; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings, a requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our board of directors, supermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors and the other provisions of our charter. Our charter also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock, and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. In addition, pursuant to federal and state laws and regulations, as a general matter, no person or company, acting individually or in concert with others, may acquire more than 10% of our common stock without prior approval from our regulators. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors. 51 The voting limitation provision in our charter could limit your voting rights as a holder of our common stock. Our charter provides that any person or group who acquires beneficial ownership of our common stock in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares may not vote the excess shares. Accordingly, if you acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, your voting rights with respect to the common stock will not be commensurate with your economic interest in our company. We rely on dividends from MutualBank for substantially all of the Company’s revenue. MutualFirst’s primary source of revenue is dividends from the Bank. The IDFI must be notified of dividends made from the Bank to the Company and may choose to limit Bank dividends. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends, MutualFirst may not be able to service its debt, pay its other obligations or pay dividends on the Company’s common stock, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or the value of your investment in our common stock. Our common stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. However, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is less than that of many larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers for our common stock at any given time. This presence is impacted by general economic and market conditions and investors’ views of our Company. Because our trading volume is limited, any significant sales of our shares could cause a decline in the price of our common stock. Our directors and executive officers have the ability to influence stockholder actions in a manner that may be adverse to the personal investment objectives of our stockholders. As of December 31, 2014, our directors and executive officers as a group beneficially owned 1,649,968 shares, or 22.8%, of our common stock (including immediately exercisable options for 361,520 shares). In addition, our employee stock ownership controlled 6.2% of our common stock on that date. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, 101,642 shares were reserved under various stock benefit plans for future awards for our directors, officers and employees. Due to this significant collective ownership of or control over our common stock, our directors and executive officers may be able to influence the outcome of director elections or block significant transactions, such as a merger or acquisition, or any other matter that might otherwise be favored by other stockholders and could prevent any stockholder action requiring a supermajority vote under our articles of incorporation. 52 Item 1B.
