ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In addition to the risk factors discussed below, investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties presented under the following captions in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of Part II of this report: REIT Conversion and Factors Influencing Our Results of Operations and Cash Flows, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. BUSINESS AND OPERATING RISKS Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Under the REIT rules, to remain qualified as a REIT, a REIT must distribute, within a certain period after the end of each year, 90% of its ordinary taxable income for such year. We anticipate that our REIT income in the foreseeable future will consist primarily of net capital gains resulting from payments to be received under timber cutting contracts with Potlatch TRS and third parties, and not ordinary taxable income. Therefore, unlike most REITs, we may not be required to distribute material amounts of cash to remain qualified as a REIT. If, after giving effect to our distributions, we have not distributed an amount equal to 2008 FORM 10-K / 9 Table of Contents 100% of our ordinary taxable income and net capital gains income, then we would be required to pay tax on the undistributed portion of such taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. In this case, our stockholders could be required to include their proportionate share of any undistributed capital gain in income and would receive a credit or refund for their share of the tax paid by us. The IRS issued a ruling in December 2008 that provides temporary guidance allowing a publicly owned real estate investment trust to distribute up to 90% of its 2009 dividends in the form of company stock. Pursuant to the guidance, the total value of the cash and stock is considered to be a distribution of current year taxable income when computing the REITs dividends paid deduction. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine the actual amount of distributions to be made to stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions in our industry and in the markets for our products, tax considerations, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions, timber prices and harvest levels on our timberlands. Our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by the fluctuating nature of timber prices. Our results of operations and cash flows will be materially affected by the fluctuating nature of timber prices. A variety of factors affect prices for timber, including factors affecting demand, such as changes in economic conditions, construction activity levels, interest rates, credit availability, population growth and weather conditions, as well as changes in timber supply and other factors. All of these factors can vary by region, timber type (saw logs or pulpwood logs) and species. In 2008, the overall price per ton for our timber was down approximately 8% from 2007. Timber prices are also affected by changes in timber availability at the local and national level. Our timberland ownership is currently concentrated in Arkansas, Idaho, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In Arkansas and Minnesota, most timberlands are privately owned. Historically, increases in timber prices have often resulted in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that has tended to moderate price increases. Decreases in timber prices have often resulted in lower harvesting activities, causing short-term decreases in supply that has tended to moderate price decreases. In Idaho, where a greater proportion of timberland is government owned, any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government-owned lands could significantly reduce timber prices, which could harm our results of operations. For more than twenty-five years, environmental concerns and other factors have limited timber sales by federal agencies, which historically had been major suppliers of timber to the United States forest products industry, particularly in the West. Any reversal of policy that substantially increases timber sales from government land could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. On a local level, timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local forest products industry participants, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires. The cyclical nature of our business could adversely affect our results of operations. The financial performance of our operations is affected by the cyclical nature of our business. The markets for timber, real estate and manufactured wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. The demand for our timber and wood products is affected by the level of new residential construction activity and, to a lesser extent, home repair and remodeling activity, which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and other factors. The demand for logs is also affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices. The demand for real estate can be affected by changes in factors such as 10 / POTLATCH CORPORATION Table of Contents interest rates, credit availability and economic conditions, as well as by the impact of federal, state and local land use and environmental protection laws. Historical prices for our wood products have been volatile, and we, like others in the forest products industry, have limited direct influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products. Our ability to harvest and sell timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Our timber harvest levels and sales may be limited due to weather conditions, timber growth cycles, restrictions on access, availability of contract loggers and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources, as well as by other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease and natural disasters such as ice storms, wind storms, hurricanes and floods. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized, affecting only a limited percentage of our timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will be limited. Our financial results and cash flows are dependent to a significant extent on our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels. Changes in harvest levels on our timberlands may have a significant impact on our results of operations, due in part to the low cost basis of much of our timber from timberlands that we acquired many years ago. Over the long term, we manage our timberlands on a sustainable yield basis to achieve a balance between timber growth and timber harvests. From time to time, however, we may choose, consistent with our environmental commitments, to harvest timber at levels above or below our estimate of sustainability for various reasons. In 2008, the overall harvest from our timberlands was 4.4 million tons, compared to 3.9 million tons harvested in 2007. Based on our current projections that take into consideration such factors as market conditions, the ages of our timber stands and recent timberland acquisitions and sales, we expect the overall timber harvest from our lands in 2009 to be between 4.2 million and 4.4 million tons, increasing to a range of 5.0 million to 5.3 million tons annually over the next few years, depending upon market conditions. On a short-term basis, we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions. For example, in 2006 we deferred a portion of our planned timber harvest in our Southern region due to weak markets. In 2007, however, due to rebounding prices, we significantly increased the harvest from our Southern region timberlands, offsetting the 2006 deferred harvest. We also experience seasonally lower harvest activity during the winter and early spring due to weather conditions. Longer term, our timber harvest levels will be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands, such as the Idaho timberlands purchased in January 2008 and September 2007 and the Wisconsin timberlands purchased in January 2007, and sales of existing timberlands. In addition to timberland acquisitions and sales, future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of genetic improvements and other silvicultural advances, natural disasters, fires and other hazards, regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control. Our timberlands are concentrated in limited geographic areas. We own approximately 1.6 million acres of timberland in two regions of the United States: the Northern region, consisting of our Idaho, Minnesota and Wisconsin timberlands; and the Southern region, consisting of our Arkansas timberlands. If the level of production from these regions substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues. We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes. The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be affected by natural disasters such as fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, hurricanes, floods and other weather conditions and causes beyond our control. We assume substantially all risk of loss to the standing timber we own from fire and other hazards because insuring for such losses is not practicable. Consequently, a reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. 2008 FORM 10-K / 11 Table of Contents Changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results. A number of factors, including tightening of credit, a slowing of residential real estate development, population growth and changes in demographics could reduce the demand for our real estate and negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of current laws, or the enactment of new laws, regarding the use and development of real estate, or changes in the political composition of federal, state and local governmental bodies could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our real estate business, profitability or financial condition. Also, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results. The timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including the general state of the economy, demand in local real estate markets, the number of properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales, the plans of adjacent landowners and our expectations of future price appreciation. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions may be beyond our control. These events could adversely affect our operating results. We may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy. We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of strategic timberland properties. Among the reasons for our REIT conversion is that we are better able to compete for acquisitions of timberlands against other entities that use tax-efficient structures. It is uncertain whether any timberland acquisitions we make will perform in accordance with our expectations. In addition, we anticipate using Internal Revenue Code section 1031 like-kind exchanges, and financing acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable timberland properties, our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms or our inability to complete like-kind exchanges, could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. The forest products industry is highly competitive. The markets for our wood products are highly competitive, and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our lines of business. Our wood products are subject to competition from wood products manufacturers in North America, and to a lesser extent in Canada. Our wood products manufacturing facilities are relatively capital intensive, which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs. These conditions have contributed to substantial price competition, particularly during periods of reduced demand. Some of our wood products competitors may currently be lower-cost producers than we are, and accordingly these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases. In addition, wood products are subject to significant competition from a variety of substitute products, including non-wood and engineered wood products. To the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressure from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, develop real estate and operate our manufacturing facilities. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands, endangered species, timber harvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the 12 / POTLATCH CORPORATION Table of Contents enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. We believe that these laws and regulations will continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results. Existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. A number of species on our timberlands have been and in the future may be protected under these laws. If current or future regulations become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase. Our manufacturing operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits covering air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage, and waste handling and disposal that govern how we operate our facilities. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, these costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws and regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding. We currently own, or formerly owned and operated, manufacturing facilities or may acquire timberlands and other properties that are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of hazardous material contaminations and other existing or potential liabilities. The cost of investigations and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we have adequate reserves recorded for the investigation and remediation of our current properties, there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations, or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future. Some environmental statutes impose strict liability, rendering an entity liable for environmental damage without regard to that entitys negligence or fault. These laws or future legislation or administrative or judicial action with respect to protection of the environment may adversely affect our business. Environmental groups and interested individuals may intervene in the regulatory processes in the locations where we own timberlands and operate our wood products mills. Delays or restrictions on our operations due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits or implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit, or even a threatened lawsuit, could delay harvesting on our timberlands or impact our ability to invest in our wood products mills. Our defined benefit pension plans became underfunded at December 31, 2008. As a result of the steep downturn in the stock market in the fourth quarter of 2008, our defined benefit pension plans went from being overfunded to underfunded. Our pension plan funding requirements are based in part on the performance of the assets in our pension plans, and that performance is highly correlated with stock market performance. Depending on the timing of a recovery in the stock market, we could be faced with increased funding requirements that could be substantial in future years. We depend on external sources of capital for future growth. Our ability to finance growth is dependent to a significant degree on external sources of capital. Our ability to access such capital on favorable terms could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, a decline in general market conditions, decreased market liquidity, a downgrade to our public debt rating, increases in interest rates, an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may 2008 FORM 10-K / 13 Table of Contents also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, among other things, restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividend distributions. Any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, and the failure to obtain necessary capital could materially adversely affect our future growth. REIT AND TAX-RELATED RISKS If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, income from our timberlands will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates and we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our stockholders. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations, including satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements, on a continuing basis. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a REIT. In addition, the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws affecting REITs, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect our stockholders or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our stockholders or us. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that new legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. If in any taxable year we fail to remain qualified as a REIT,  we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and  we will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. In addition, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions. As a result, net income and the funds available for distribution to our stockholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer, which would have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. There are uncertainties relating to the estimate of our special E&P distribution, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we were required to distribute to our stockholders all of our accumulated non-REIT tax earnings and profits, or E&P, prior to the end of our first taxable year as a REIT, which was December 31, 2006. In 2006, a special E&P distribution in the aggregate amount of approximately $445 million was distributed to our stockholders. We believe that the amount of our special E&P distribution equaled or exceeded the amount required to be distributed in order to satisfy the requirements relating to the distribution of E&P. There are, however, uncertainties relating to the determination of the amount of our pre-REIT E&P, including the possibility that the IRS could, in any audits for tax years through 2005, successfully assert that our taxable income should be increased, which would increase our pre-REIT E&P. Thus, we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distributed all of our pre-REIT E&P by the close of our first taxable year as a REIT. Moreover, although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our pre-REIT E&P, we cannot now determine whether we would be able to take advantage of them or the economic impact on us of doing so. 14 / POTLATCH CORPORATION Table of Contents Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax on 100% of our net income, which would reduce our cash flow and impair our ability to make distributions. REITs are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, which for us generally include: owning and managing a timberland portfolio; growing timber; and selling standing timber. Accordingly, the manufacture and sale by us of wood products, certain types of timberlands sales, and the harvest and sale of logs are conducted through Potlatch TRS because such activities generate non-qualifying REIT income and could constitute prohibited transactions if such activities were engaged in directly by the REIT. In general, prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code to be sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. By conducting our business in this manner, we believe we will satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and avoid the 100% tax that could be imposed if a REIT were to conduct a prohibited transaction. We may not always be successful, however, in limiting such activities to Potlatch TRS. Therefore, we could be subject to the 100% prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur, which would adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to make quarterly distributions. Our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiary may be limited. The rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT limit our ability to use dividends from our wood products manufacturing business for the payment of stockholder distributions. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of real estate income. No more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividends from Potlatch TRS and other non-qualifying types of income. This requirement may limit our ability to receive dividends from Potlatch TRS and may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders using cash flows from Potlatch TRS. We may not be able to complete desired like-kind exchange transactions for property we sell. We generally seek to match sales and acquisitions of properties, which allows us to use Internal Revenue Code section 1031 like-kind exchange tax-deferred treatment. The matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits, primarily the deferral of any gain on the property sold until the ultimate disposition of the replacement property. While we attempt to complete like-kind exchanges whenever possible, it is unlikely that we will be able to do so in all instances due to various factors, including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and the inability to complete a qualifying like-kind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the Code. The inability to obtain like-kind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold, and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to stockholders. RISKS RELATED TO OUR SPIN-OFF If the spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders who received the distribution of Clearwater Paper common stock could face significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In connection with the spin-off, we obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS that the spin-off will qualify for tax-free treatment under applicable sections of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The ruling relies on certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the business of Clearwater Paper, and the private letter ruling would not be valid if these representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect. Moreover, the private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the spin-off qualifies for tax-free treatment. The IRS could determine that the spin-off should be treated as a taxable transaction if 2008 FORM 10-K / 15 Table of Contents it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling were false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions that are not covered by the IRS ruling. If the spin-off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold Clearwater Paper common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who received the distribution of Clearwater Paper common stock would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of the Clearwater Paper common stock that was distributed to them. Furthermore, the income that we would recognize if the spin-off were determined to be taxable could cause us to fail to meet the REIT tax requirements, including the requirement that at least 75% of our gross income must be derived from sales of standing timber and other types of real estate income. In addition, certain types of actions by Clearwater Paper following the spin-off, including certain issuances or redemptions of Clearwater Paper equity securities or involvement in certain other acquisitions of Clearwater Paper securities, could jeopardize the tax-free status of the spin-off. While Clearwater Paper has agreed not to take theses types of actions and to indemnify us for the consequences of taking these actions, we may not be able to prevent the occurrence of actions by Clearwater Paper that would cause the spin-off not to qualify for tax-free treatment. The obligation represented by the credit sensitive debentures remains our liability until paid and if Clearwater Paper fails to meet its payment obligations under the Retained Obligation Agreement, holders of the debentures will have legal recourse against us. In 2005, Clearwater Paper assumed the obligation to pay all principal and interest on $100 million principal amount of credit sensitive debentures previously issued by our wholly owned subsidiary, Potlatch Forest Holdings, Inc. The debentures become due and payable in full on December 1, 2009. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into the Retained Obligation Agreement with Clearwater Paper, which provides that Clearwater Paper will retain the obligation to repay the principal and interest on the debentures. Despite Clearwater Papers retention of payment obligations under the debentures, holders of the debentures continue to have legal recourse against Potlatch Forest Holdings, Inc. for any failure to make payments when due and the obligation represented by the debentures will remain as a liability on our balance sheet until paid. Accordingly, we must retain sufficient liquidity and capital resources to make payments on the debentures in 2009 in the event that Clearwater Paper is unable to meet its payment obligations under the Retained Obligation Agreement. RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile take over attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interest of us and our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate or incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:  a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;  stockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent and stockholders cannot call a special meeting except upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting; 16 / POTLATCH CORPORATION Table of Contents  advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;  removal of directors only for cause;  allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors;  in order to facilitate the preservation of our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, a prohibition on any single stockholder, or any group of affiliated stockholders, from beneficially owning more than 9.8% of our outstanding common or preferred stock, unless our board waives or modifies this ownership limitation;  unless approved by the vote of at least 80% of our outstanding shares, we may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock; and  supermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met. ITEM 1B.
