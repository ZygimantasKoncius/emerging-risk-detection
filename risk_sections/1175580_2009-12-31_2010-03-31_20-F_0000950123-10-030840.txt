D. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, which may also harm our business. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any such additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In this case, the trading price of our ordinary shares and American Depositary Shares, or ADS, could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Operations The profitability of our operations, and the cash flows generated by our operations, are affected by changes in the market price for gold which in the past has fluctuated widely. Substantially all of our revenue and cash flows have come from the sale of gold. Historically, the market price for gold has fluctuated widely and has been affected by numerous factors, over which we have no control, including:  the demand for gold for investment purposes, industrial uses and for use in jewelry;  international or regional political and economic trends;  the strength of the US dollar, the currency in which gold prices generally are quoted, and of other currencies;  market expectations regarding inflation rates; 7  interest rates;  speculative activities;  actual or expected purchases and sales of gold bullion holdings by central banks, the International Monetary Fund, or other large gold bullion holders or dealers;  hedging activities by gold producers; and  the production and cost levels for gold in major gold-producing nations. The volatility of gold prices is illustrated in the following table, which shows the approximate annual high, low and average of the afternoon London Bullion Market fixing price of gold in US dollars for the past ten years. Price Per Ounce ($) Year High Low Average 2000 313 264 279 2001 293 256 271 2002 349 278 310 2003 416 320 363 2004 454 375 409 2005 537 411 444 2006 725 525 604 2007 841 608 695 2008 1,011 712 871 2009 1,213 810 972 2010 (through February) 1,153 1,058 1,107 If gold prices should fall below and remain below our cost of production for any sustained period we may experience losses, and if gold prices should fall below our cash costs of production we may be forced to curtail or suspend some or all of our mining operations. In addition, we would also have to assess the economic impact of low gold prices on our ability to recover from any losses we may incur during that period and on our ability to maintain adequate reserves. Our total cash cost of production per ounce of gold sold was $510 in the year ended December 31, 2009, $467 in the year ended December 31, 2008, and $356 in the year ended December 31, 2007. We expect that Morilas cash costs per ounce will rise as the life of the mine advances as a result of expected declining grade, which will adversely affect our profitability in the absence of any mitigating factors. The high grades expected from the underground mining at Loulo will, in the absence of any other increases, have a positive impact on unit costs. Our mining operations may yield less gold under actual production conditions than indicated by our gold reserve figures, which are estimates based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions as to mining and recovery factors, production costs and the price of gold. The ore reserve estimates contained in this Annual Report are estimates of the mill delivered quantity and grade of gold in our deposits and stockpiles. They represent the amount of gold that we believe can be mined, processed and sold at prices sufficient to recover our estimated total cash costs of production, remaining investment and anticipated additional capital expenditures. Our ore reserves are estimated based upon many factors, including:  the results of exploratory drilling and an ongoing sampling of the orebodies;  past experience with mining properties;  gold price; and  operating costs. Because our ore reserve estimates are calculated based on current estimates of future production costs and gold prices, they should not be interpreted as assurances of the economic life of our gold deposits or the profitability of our future operations. Reserve estimates may require revisions based on actual production experience. Further, a sustained decline in the market price of gold may render the recovery of ore reserves containing relatively lower grades of gold mineralization uneconomical and ultimately result in a restatement of reserves. The failure of the reserves to meet our recovery expectations may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 The profitability of operations and the cash flows generated by these operations are significantly affected by the fluctuations in the price, cost and supply of inputs. Fuel, power and consumables, including diesel, steel, chemical reagents, explosives and tires, form a relatively large part of our operating costs. The cost of these consumables is impacted to varying degrees, by fluctuations in the price of oil, exchange rates and a shortage of supplies. Such fluctuations have a significant impact upon our operating costs and capital expenditure estimates and, in the absence of other economic fluctuations, could result in significant changes in the total expenditure estimates for mining projects, new and existing, and could even render certain projects non-viable. Any appreciation of the currencies in which we incur costs against the US dollar could adversely affect our results of operations. While our revenue is derived from the sale of gold in US dollars, a significant portion of our input costs are incurred in currencies other than the dollar, primarily Euro, South African Rand, Communauté Financière Africaine franc and the Congolese franc. Accordingly, any appreciation in such other currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Our results of operations have been adversely affected by increases in fuel prices, and we would be adversely affected by future increases in fuel prices or disruptions in the supply of fuel. Our results are significantly affected by the price and availability of fuel, which are in turn affected by a number of factors beyond our control. Fuel prices are volatile and increased significantly in 2008. While prices decreased significantly in 2009, they remain higher than historical standards. In the year ended December 31, 2009, the cost of fuel and other power generation costs comprised 25% of our operating costs and the annual price decrease of our landed fuel was 16%. Historically, fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical factors and supply and demand. While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability, factors beyond our control make it impossible to predict the future availability of fuel. If there are additional outbreaks of hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere, or a reduction in refining capacity (due to weather events, for example), or governmental limits on the production or sale of fuel, or restrictions on the transport of fuel, there could be reductions in the supply of fuel and significant increases in the cost of fuel. We are not parties to any agreements that protect us against price increases or guarantee the availability of fuel. Major reductions in the availability of fuel or significant increases in its cost, or a continuation of current high prices for a significant period of time, would have a material adverse impact on us. Our business may be adversely affected if the Government of Mali fails to repay Value Added Tax, or TVA, owing to Morila and Loulo. Our mining companies operating in Mali are exonerated by their Establishment Conventions from paying TVA for the three years following first commercial production. After that, TVA is payable and reimbursable. TVA is only reclaimable insofar as it is expended in the production of income. A key aspect in TVA recovery is managing the completion of the Government of Malis audit of the taxpayers payments, at which time the Government of Mali recognizes a liability. By December 2007, Morila had successfully concluded a reimbursement protocol with the Government of Mali for all TVA reimbursements it was owed up to June 2005. Morila was unable to conclude a second protocol subsequent to December 2007, however, and pursuant to its establishment convention, began offsetting TVA reimbursements it was owed against corporate and other taxes payable by Morila to the Government of Mali. As a result of the offsets, the TVA owed by the Government of Mali to Morila declined to $2.6 million at December 31, 2009. Morila is in discussions with the Malian fiscal authorities in order to ensure that the tax offsets are accurately recorded and recognized, although we cannot assure you that the Government of Mali will ultimately recognize the tax offsets. At June 30, 2009, TVA owed by the Government of Mali to Loulo stood at $16.2 million. This amount has increased by $20.8 million to $37.0 million at December 31, 2009 due to the end of the exoneration period on November 8, 2008. If Morila and Loulo are unable to recover these funds, or if the tax offsets are not recognized, then their results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected, as would their ability to pay dividends to their shareholders. Accordingly, our business, cash flows and financial condition will be adversely affected if anticipated dividends are not paid. Our business may be adversely affected if the Government of Mali fails to repay fuel duties owing to Morila and Loulo. Up to June 2005, Morila was responsible for paying to diesel suppliers the customs duties which were then paid to the Government of Mali. Our operations at Morila and Loulo could claim reimbursement of these duties from the Government of Mali on presentation of a certificate from Société Générale de Surveillance. During the third quarter of 2003, the Government of Mali began to reduce 9 payments to all the mines in Mali due to irregularities involving certain small exploration companies. The Government of Mali has since given full exoneration from fuel duties to the mining industry so that fuel duties are no longer payable. However, a portion of previously paid duties remain outstanding, principally, the duties paid for the period June 2005 to December 2005. Our share of the amounts owing to Morila was $0 on December 31, 2009 and $2.1 million on December 31, 2008. Amounts owing to Loulo were $0.7 million on December 31, 2009 and $0.7 million on December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, Morilas outstanding fuel duties were offset in full against corporate and other taxes payable by the mine. If Morila and Loulo are unable to recover these amounts, or if the amounts offset are not recognized, then their results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected, as would their ability to pay dividends to their shareholders. Accordingly, our business, cash flows and financial condition will be adversely affected if anticipated dividends are not paid. Certain factors may affect our ability to support the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, and other assets on our consolidated statement of financial position. We review and test the carrying amount of our assets on an annual basis when events or changes in circumstances suggest that the net book value may not be recoverable. If there are indications that impairment may have occurred, we prepare estimates of expected future discounted cash flows for each group of assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units) for purposes of assessing impairment. Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain, and could materially change over time. Such cash flows are significantly affected by reserve and production estimates, together with economic factors such as spot and forward gold prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of costs to produce reserves and future capital expenditures. During 2008 and 2009, we recorded impairment charges against our auction rate securities, or ARS, which are described in the following paragraph. We have invested in debt instruments for which the market has become substantially illiquid. We have invested in debt instruments for which the market has become substantially illiquid. We had cash and cash equivalents of $590 million as of December 31, 2009. In addition, we had available-for-sale financial assets with a carrying value of approximately $29.0 million as of December 31, 2009. The available-for-sale financial assets consist of auction rate securities, or ARS. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, ARS with a cost value of $49 million failed at auctions due to the sudden and unusual deterioration in the global credit and capital markets, and have since experienced multiple failed auctions. Consequently, the funds associated with these investments will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured. We made provisions against these ARS of $9.6 million in 2009 following the deterioration of the underlying credit ratings of the collateral of certain of the ARS. The trading market for these instruments has become substantially illiquid as a result of current conditions in the markets. As these investments have been illiquid for more than twelve months and there is no certainty that they will become liquid within the next twelve months, these assets have continued to be classified as non-current available-for-sale financial assets in order to accurately reflect their nature. Management estimates the fair value of these investments at each reporting period. Management applies a mark to model valuation method. Continued uncertainties in the credit and capital markets may result in additional impairment provisions, which could adversely impact our financial condition, current asset position and reported earnings. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our actions against the bank or the individual brokers that we have commenced, which are described in this Annual Report under Item 4. Business Overview-Legal Proceedings. We may not be able to recover certain funds from MDM Ferroman (Pty) Limited. In August 2004, we entered into a fixed lump sum turnkey contract for $63 million for the design, supply, construction and commissioning of the Loulo processing plant and infrastructure with MDM Ferroman (Pty) Ltd, or MDM. At the end of 2005, after making advances and additional payments to MDM totaling $26 million in excess of the contract, we determined that MDM was unable to perform its obligations under the MDM Contract, at which time we enforced a contractual remedy which allowed us to act as our own general contractor and to complete the remaining work on the Loulo project that was required under the MDM Contract. We believe that we are entitled to recover certain amounts from MDM, including advances of $10.5 million (December 31, 2008: $12.1 million) included in receivables as at December 31, 2009. Of this latter amount, $7 million is secured by performance bonds and the remainder is secured by various personal guarantees and other assets. In January 2009, the liquidator declared and paid the first dividend of $0.1 million from the insolvent estate, leaving an outstanding balance of $10.5 million (stated net of a present value and impairment provision of $1.1 million) as at December 31, 2009. As part of our efforts to recoup the monies owed to us, MDM was put into liquidation on February 1, 2006. This resulted in a South African Companies Act Section 417 investigation into the business and financial activities of MDM, its affiliated companies 10 and their directors. This investigation was completed in the last quarter of 2007 and the liquidators have issued their report that confirms that MDMs liabilities exceeded its assets. Our ability to recover in full the $10.5 million included in receivables is dependent on the amounts which can be recovered from the performance bonds, personal guarantees and other assets provided as security. Any shortfall is expected to be recovered from any free residue accruing to the insolvent estate. The aggregate amount which will ultimately be recovered cannot presently be determined. The financial statements do not reflect any additional provision that may be required if the $10.5 million cannot be recovered in full. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recover the amounts advanced by us to MDM. Any part of the $10.5 million included in accounts receivable which cannot in fact be recovered will need to be charged as an expense. The ultimate outcome of this claim cannot presently be determined and there is significant uncertainty surrounding the amount that will ultimately be recovered. We may incur losses or lose opportunities for gains as a result of our use of derivative instruments to protect us against low gold prices. We use derivative instruments to protect the selling price of some of our anticipated gold production at Loulo. The intended effect of our derivative transactions is to lock in a fixed sale price for some of our future gold production to provide some protection against a subsequent fall in gold prices. No such protection is in place for our production at Morila. Derivative transactions can result in a reduction in revenue if the instrument price is less than the market price at the time the hedged sales are recognized. Moreover, our decision to enter into a given instrument is based upon market assumptions. If these assumptions are not met, significant losses or lost opportunities for significant gains may result. In all, the use of these instruments may result in significant losses which will prevent us from realizing the positive impact of any subsequent increase in the price of gold on the portion of production covered by the instrument. Our underground project at Loulo, developing two mines at Yalea and Gara, is subject to all of the risks associated with project development and underground mining. Development of the underground mine at Yalea commenced in December 2006 and first ore was mined in April 2008. These planned mines represent our entry into the business of underground mining, and the commencement of underground mining in Mali by any mining company. In connection with the development of the underground mines, we must build the necessary infrastructure, the costs of which are substantial. The underground mines may experience unexpected problems and delays during their development and construction. Delays in the commencement of gold production could occur and the development costs could be larger than expected, which could affect our results of operations and profitability. Since the commencement of the underground operations at Yalea, in working with a mining contractor, we have experienced a number of challenges which have led to delays and slower build up of production. These challenges included the availability of the underground fleet, the ability to drill and blast up holes and the contractors poor safety record. Following these setbacks experienced during 2009, we terminated the underground mining contract with the contractor and have assumed responsibility for underground mining at Loulo. While we have experienced significant improvement in our results at Loulo during December 2009, the development and operation of the underground mine has been negatively impacted by these issues and resulting delays, and we cannot assure you that such issues are fully resolved or that we will not have future delays. The business of underground mining by its nature involves significant risks and hazards. In particular, as the development commences the operation could be subject to:  rockbursts;  seismic events;  underground fires;  cave-ins or falls of ground;  discharges of gases or toxic chemicals;  flooding;  accidents; and  other conditions resulting from drilling, blasting and the removal of material from an underground mine. 11 We are at risk of experiencing any and all of these hazards. The occurrence of any of these hazards could delay the development of the mine, production, increase cash operating costs and result in additional financial liability for us. Our success may depend on our social and environmental performance. Our ability to operate successfully in communities will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the health, safety and well-being of our employees, the protection of the environment, and the creation of long-term economic and social opportunities in the communities in which we operate. We seek to promote improvements in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, our ability to operate could be adversely impacted by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health, safety and well-being of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate. In July 2009, the Loulo mine experienced some disruption, caused by a small group of disaffected people unable to secure long term employment at the mine. The disruption resulted in some damage to the tailings pipeline as well as to some accommodation units and other property. All operations were suspended for 36 hours, following which all mining and processing operations were restored and operating back at normal capacity. We cannot assure you that similar events will not happen in the future, or that such events will not adversely affect our results of operations and properties. Actual cash costs of production, production results and economic returns may differ significantly from those anticipated by our feasibility studies and scoping studies for new development projects, including Tongon. It can take a number of years from initial feasibility studies of a mining project until development is completed and, during that time, the economic feasibility of production may change. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, metallurgical recoveries, capital and operating costs and future gold prices. The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics. Thus it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, there are a number of uncertainties inherent in the development and construction of any new mine, including:  the availability and timing of necessary environmental and governmental permits;  the timing and cost necessary to construct mining and processing facilities, which can be considerable;  the availability and cost of skilled labor, power, water and other materials;  the accessibility of transportation and other infrastructure, particularly in remote locations; and  the availability of funds to finance construction and development activities. At our Tongon project in Côte dIvoire, our board approved the development of the new mine based on the strength of a feasibility study. A final draft of the proposed mining convention was submitted to Côte dIvoires Ministry of Mines and Energy in 2008 and progress has been made regarding the approval of the mining convention, with the Tongon Mining License presently awaiting signature. Construction of the mine commenced at the end of 2008 with first gold production scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2010. We cannot provide any assurance that the project will ultimately result in a new commercial mining operation, or that a new commercial mining operation will be successful. We conduct mining, development and exploration activities in countries with developing economies and are subject to the risks of political and economic instability associated with these countries. We currently conduct mining, development and exploration activities in countries with developing economies. These countries and other emerging markets in which we may conduct operations have, from time to time, experienced economic or political instability. It is difficult to predict the future political, social and economic direction of the countries in which we operate, and the impact government decisions may have on our business. Any political or economic instability in the countries in which we currently operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The countries of Mali, Senegal, Burkina Faso, DRC and Côte dIvoire have, since independence, experienced some form of political upheaval with varying forms of changes of government taking place. Côte dIvoire has experienced several years of political chaos, including an attempted coup détat. The political situation in that country is normalizing and national elections are anticipated in 2010. Goods are supplied to our operations in Mali through Ghana and Senegal, which routings have, to date, functioned satisfactorily. Our operations at Morila have been adversely affected by the higher transportation costs for diesel that now has to be delivered via 12 Senegal. Any present or future policy changes in the countries in which we operate may in some way have a significant effect on our operations and interests. The mining laws of Mali, Côte dIvoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and DRC stipulate that, should an economic orebody be discovered on a property subject to an exploration permit, a permit that allows processing operations to be undertaken must be issued to the holder. Legislation in these countries currently provides for the relevant government to acquire a free ownership interest in any mining project. The requirements of the various governments as to the foreign ownership and control of mining companies may change in a manner which adversely affects us. We are subject to various political and economic uncertainties associated with operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the success of the Kibali project will depend in large part on our ability to overcome significant challenges. We are subject to risks associated with operating the Kibali project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Kibali project is located in the north-east region of the DRC and is subject to various levels of political, economic and other risks and uncertainties associated with operating in the DRC. Some of these risks include political and economic instability, high rates of inflation, severely limited infrastructure, lack of law enforcement, labor unrest, and war and civil conflict. In addition, the Kibali project is subject to the risks inherent in operating in any foreign jurisdiction including changes in government policy, restrictions on foreign exchange, changes in taxation policies, and renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts. The DRC is an impoverished country with physical and institutional infrastructure that is in a debilitated condition. It is in transition from a largely state-controlled economy to one based on free market principles, and from a non-democratic political system with a centralized ethnic power base to one based on more democratic principles. There can be no assurance that these changes will be effected or that the achievement of these objectives will not have material adverse consequences for the Kibali project. Any changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in the DRC may adversely affect operations and/or profitability of the Kibali project. Operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, income taxes, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. These changes may impact the profitability and viability of the Kibali project. Furthermore, the Kibali project is located in a remote area of the DRC, which lacks basic infrastructure, including adequate roads and other transport, sources of power, water, housing, food and transport. In order to develop any of the mineral interests, facilities and material necessary to support operations in the remote locations in which they are situated must be established. The remoteness of the mineral interests would affect the potential viability of mining operations, as we would also need to establish substantially greater sources of power, water, physical plant, roads and other transport infrastructure than are currently present in the area. More specifically, we must obtain necessary licenses from the government to construct and operate hydropower stations, which will necessarily involve reconfiguring, refurbishing and maintaining existing stations. Our ability to produce sufficient power for the Kibali will be adversely affected to the extent such licenses cannot be obtained, or we are unable to comply with the conditions of such licenses. Moreover, the north-east region of the DRC has undergone civil unrest and instability that could have an impact on political, social or economic conditions in the DRC generally. The instability must be appropriately addressed in order for us to build and operate a mine at the Kibali project site. The impact of unrest and instability on political, social or economic conditions in the DRC could result in the impairment of the exploration, development and operations at the Kibali project. The communities near the Kibali project need to be resettled in an orderly manner and peaceful manner to allow the development and operation of a mine at the site. We have committed to assist the DRC government in these efforts. Any failure to complete the settlement plan successfully will materially and adversely affect our ability to build and operate a mine at the Kibali project site. Under our joint venture agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Limited, or AngloGold Ashanti, we jointly manage Morila and the Kibali project, and any disputes with AngloGold Ashanti over the management of Morila or the Kibali project could adversely affect our business. We jointly control Morila SA, the owner of the Morila mine, and Kibali Goldmines SPRL, the owner of the Kibali project, with AngloGold Ashanti under joint venture agreements. We are responsible for the day-to-day operations of Morila and the Kibali project, subject to the overall management control of the Morila SA and Kibali Goldmines boards, respectively. Substantially all major management decisions, including approval of a budget for Morila and the Kibali project, must be approved by the Morila SA and Kibali Goldmines boards, respectively. We and AngloGold Ashanti retain equal representation on the boards, with neither party holding a deciding vote. If a dispute arises between us and AngloGold Ashanti with respect to the management of Morila SA or 13 Kibali Goldmines, and we are unable to amicably resolve the dispute, we may have to participate in arbitration or other proceeding to resolve the dispute, which could materially and adversely affect our business. The use of mining contractors at certain of our operations may expose it to delays or suspensions in mining activities. Mining contractors are used at Loulo and Morila to mine and deliver ore to processing plants. These mining contractors rely on third-party vendors to supply them with required mining equipment, many of which have been adversely affected by the global economic slowdown. Consequently, at these mines, we do not own all of the mining equipment and may face disruption of operations and incur costs and liabilities in the event that any of the mining contractors at these mines, or any of the vendors that supply them, has financial difficulties, or should there be a dispute in renegotiating a mining contract, or a delay in replacing an existing contractor. Following setbacks experienced during 2009 at Loulo, we terminated the underground mining contract with the contractor and assumed responsibility for the underground mining. We may be required to seek funding from the global credit and capital markets to develop our properties, and the recent weaknesses in those markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing and capital resources. We require substantial funding to develop our properties, and may be required to seek funding from the credit and capital markets to finance these activities. Our ability to obtain outside financing will depend upon the price of gold and the markets perception of its future price, and other factors outside of our control. We may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms when required, or at all. The credit and capital markets experienced significant deterioration in 2008, including the failure of significant and established financial institutions in the US and abroad, which continued throughout 2009 and may continue in 2010 and beyond, all of which will have an impact on the availability and terms of credit and capital in the near term. If uncertainties in these markets continue, or these markets deteriorate further, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. Failure to raise capital when needed or on reasonable terms may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the emotion, political significance and uncertainty around the impacts of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations. We may not pay dividends to shareholders in the near future. We paid our fourth dividend since 2007 to ordinary shareholders in March 2010. It is our policy to pay dividends if profits and funds are available for that purpose. Whether or not funds are available depends on a variety of factors, including capital expenditures. We cannot guarantee that dividends will be paid in the future. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business may be harmed. Our ability to bring additional mineral properties into production and explore our extensive portfolio of mineral rights will depend, in large part, upon the skills and efforts of a small group of management and technical personnel, including D. Mark Bristow, our Chief Executive Officer. If we are not successful in retaining or attracting highly qualified individuals in key management positions our business may be harmed. The loss of any of our key personnel could adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan. Our insurance coverage may prove inadequate to satisfy future claims against us. We may become subject to liabilities, including liabilities for pollution or other hazards, against which we have not insured adequately or at all, or cannot insure. Our insurance policies contain exclusions and limitations on coverage. Our current insurance policies provide worldwide indemnity of £50 million in relation to legal liability incurred as a result of death, injury, disease of persons and/or loss of or damage to property. Main exclusions under this insurance policy, which relates to our industry, include war, nuclear risks, silicosis, asbestosis or other fibrosis of the lungs or diseases of the respiratory system with regard to employees, and 14 gradual pollution. In addition, our insurance policies may not continue to be available at economically acceptable premiums. As a result, in the future our insurance coverage may not cover the extent of claims against us. It may be difficult for you to affect service of process and enforce legal judgments against us or our affiliates. We are incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands and a majority of our directors and senior executives are not residents of the United States. Virtually all of our assets and the assets of those persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons or us. Furthermore, the United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, it may not be possible for you to enforce a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States Federal securities laws against those persons or us. In order to enforce any judgment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States in Jersey, proceedings must be initiated by way of common law action before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. The entry of an enforcement order by a court in Jersey is conditional upon the following:  that the court which pronounced the judgment has jurisdiction to entertain the case according to the principles recognized by Jersey law with reference to the jurisdiction of the foreign courts;  that the judgment is final and conclusive  it cannot be altered by the courts which pronounced it;  that there is payable pursuant to a judgment a sum of money, not being a sum payable in respect of tax or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty;  that the judgment has not been prescribed;  that the courts of the foreign country have jurisdiction in the circumstances of the case;  that the judgment was not obtained by fraud; and  that the recognition and enforcement of the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Jersey, including observance of the rules of natural justice which require that documents in the United States proceeding were properly served on the defendant and that the defendant was given the right to be heard and represented by counsel in a free and fair trial before an impartial tribunal. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether you could bring an original action based on United States Federal securities laws in a Jersey court. We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our share price. As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. For example, we cannot provide assurance that in the future our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our share price could decline. Risks Relating to Our Industry The exploration of mineral properties is highly speculative in nature, involves substantial expenditures, and is frequently unproductive. We must continually seek to replenish our ore reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term. Ore reserves can be replaced by expanding known ore bodies or exploring for new deposits. Exploration for gold is highly speculative in nature. Our future growth and profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to identify and acquire additional mineral rights, and on the costs and results of our continued exploration and development programs. Many exploration programs, including some of ours, do not result in the discovery of mineralization and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. Our mineral exploration rights may not contain commercially exploitable reserves of gold. Uncertainties as to the metallurgical recovery of any gold discovered may not warrant mining on the basis of available technology. Our operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral properties, such as:  encountering unusual or unexpected formations; 15  environmental pollution;  personal injury and flooding; and  decrease in reserves due to a lower gold price. If we discover a viable deposit, it usually takes several years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible. During this time, the economic feasibility of production may change. Moreover, we will use the evaluation work of professional geologists, geophysicists, and engineers for estimates in determining whether to commence or continue mining. These estimates generally rely on scientific and economic assumptions, which in some instances may not be correct, and could result in the expenditure of substantial amounts of money on a deposit before it can be determined whether or not the deposit contains economically recoverable mineralization. As a result of these uncertainties, we may not successfully acquire additional mineral rights, or identify new proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations in any of our properties. If management determines that capitalized costs associated with any of our gold interests are not likely to be recovered, we would recognize an impairment provision against the amounts capitalized for that interest. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are found not to be recoverable. Title to our mineral properties may be challenged which may prevent or severely curtail our use of the affected properties. Title to our properties may be challenged or impugned, and title insurance is generally not available. Each sovereign state is the sole authority able to grant mineral property rights, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure title to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Our mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. In addition, we may be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties. Our ability to obtain desirable mineral exploration projects in the future may be adversely affected by competition from other exploration companies. We compete with other mining companies in connection with the search for and acquisition of properties producing or possessing the potential to produce gold. Existing or future competition in the mining industry could materially and adversely affect our prospects for mineral exploration and success in the future. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental and environmental regulations, which could cause us to incur costs that adversely affect our results of operations. Our mining facilities and operations are subject to substantial government laws and regulations, concerning mine safety, land use and environmental protection. We must comply with requirements regarding exploration operations, public safety, employee health and safety, use of explosives, air quality, water pollution, noxious odor, noise and dust controls, reclamation, solid waste, hazardous waste and wildlife as well as laws protecting the rights of other property owners and the public. Any failure on our part to be in compliance with these laws, regulations, and requirements with respect to our properties could result in us being subject to substantial penalties, fees and expenses, significant delays in our operations or even the complete shutdown of our operations. We provide for estimated environmental rehabilitation costs when the related environmental disturbance takes place. Estimates of rehabilitation costs are subject to revision as a result of future changes in regulations and cost estimates. The costs associated with compliance with government regulations may ultimately be material and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If our environmental and other governmental permits are not renewed or additional conditions are imposed on our permits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Generally, compliance with environmental and other government regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by governmental agencies. Some permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions. We cannot predict whether we will be able to renew these permits or whether material changes in permit conditions will be imposed. Non-renewal of a permit may cause us to discontinue the operations requiring the permit, and the imposition of additional conditions on a permit may cause us to incur additional compliance costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Labor disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our operations in West Africa are highly unionized, and strikes are legal in the countries in which we operate. Therefore, our operations are at risk of having work interrupted for indefinite periods due to industrial action, such as strikes by employee collectives. 16 Should long disruptions take place on our operations, the results from our operations and their financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. AIDS poses risks to us in terms of productivity and costs. The incidence of AIDS in Mali, Côte dIvoire, Senegal and the DRC, which has been forecast to increase over the next decade, poses risks to us in terms of potentially reduced productivity and increased medical and insurance costs. The exact extent to which our workforce is infected is not known at present. The prevalence of AIDS in the countries in which we operate and among our workforce could become significant. Significant increases in the incidence of AIDS infection and AIDS-related diseases among members of our workforce in the future could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. Item
