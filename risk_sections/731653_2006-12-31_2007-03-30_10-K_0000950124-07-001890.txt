ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in the Company's common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Company's business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision, investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that Management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company's business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company's common stock could decline significantly, and investors would lose all or part of their investment. RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS INTEREST RATE RISK - The Company's earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest income paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including general economic and market conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Company's ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair values of the Company's financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate or decrease at a slower rate than the interest rates received on loans and investments, the Company's net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company's results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates or in the term structure of interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this report for further discussion related to the Company's management if interest rate risk. LENDING RISK - There are inherent risks associated with the Company's lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in economic conditions in the markets where the Company operates as well as those across the State of Ohio and the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company. The Company maintains an Allowance for Loan Losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management's best estimate of probable loan losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The Allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the Allowance reflects management's continuing evaluation of loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the Allowance inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of the Company's control, may require an increase in the Allowance. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company's Allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. ECONOMIC RISK - The Company's success depends significantly on the general economic conditions of Southeastern and Central Ohio. Unlike larger regional or national banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in Southeast and Central Ohio and Northeast West Virginia. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company's products and services as well as the ability of the Company's customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of the Company's deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. COMPETITIVE RISK - The Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include regional and national banks within the market the Company operates. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, and insurance. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Company's competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale, and as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services. Increased competition could adversely affect the Company's growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. REGULATORY RISK - The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial products and services, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. FAILURE OR CIRCUMVENTION OF CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES - Management regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal controls, disclosure controls, and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
