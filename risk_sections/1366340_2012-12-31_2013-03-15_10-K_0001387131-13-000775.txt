ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investors in our securities should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below because they could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects and could negatively affect the market price of our securities. Investors in our securities should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Risks Related to our Business We could fail to remain a going concern. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations through the near term, and we do not have any commitments for that capital. There exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has added an explanatory paragraph to their report for the year ended December 31, 2012 with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we became unable to continue as a going concern, we would have to liquidate our assets and we might receive significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our outstanding debt is secured by our assets; therefore, any value we receive from the sale of or assets in liquidation would be first utilized to repay our outstanding debt. As such, it is unlikely that our equity holders would receive any value in such a liquidation. The inclusion of a going concern paragraph in our independent registered public accounting firm’s audit opinion for the year ended December 31, 2012 may materially and adversely affect our stock or our ability to raise new capital. If the Company does not receive additional funds from external funding sources or from the continued sale of convertible notes in 2013, the Company will not have sufficient cash to be able to continue its operations. The Company anticipates that it will exhaust its cash position as of March 31, 2013 and unless additional financing can be secured (for which there are no commitments) the Company will not be able to continue operations after March 31, 2013. Therefore, since the fourth quarter of 2011, in order to conserve cash, the Company has determined to continue operations in the organic fertilizer business segment while curtailing all but essential personnel at the corporate level and in 2012, terminated its operations in the Industrial Wastewater Treatment segment and sold its operations in the Vertical Farming segments. While it is uncertain whether there will be positive cash flows from the Organic Fertilizer segment, any such cash flows will continue to be directly generated as part of the ongoing operations and continued involvement of the Company. We will need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations, and such financing has in the past and will continue to result in substantial dilution to our shareholders, and will likely result in the need for us to implement future reverse stock splits. To meet future capital requirements necessary to fund our business, we have and will, to the extent available to us, continue to issue convertible notes. In 2011 and 2012, we issued a series of senior secured convertible notes to fund our operations. These notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price equal to 80% of our lowest stock bid prices on the day of conversion. Due to our historically low stock price, the conversion of these notes has resulted in a massive number of shares being issued, which required us to effect a 1:10 reverse split in November 2011 and a 1:500 reverse split in February 2012 in order to maintain sufficient shares to permit the conversions. In addition, if the price of our common stock remains at current levels, we would still not have sufficient shares to permit the full conversion of the notes which means we would be required to either repay the note in cash, which we do not have, or to implement a reverse stock split, one of which was approved by our shareholders on June 8, 2012 or request approval from our shareholders to complete one or more additional reverse stock splits. 6 If the National Organic Program changes its standards with respect to the use of any ingredient in organic fertilizer production, we may no longer be allowed to sell certain of our products into the organic markets, which would materially lower sales at our Gonzales, CA facility. We are subject to regulation by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) with regard to ingredients included in the production of organic fertilizers. Currently, all of the ingredients used in our organic fertilizer production are classified as organic; however, the NOSB does meet to reconsider items on a periodic basis. In 2011 they reviewed Corn Steep Liquor, one of our major components of production and the organic classification was not changed for that ingredient. We expect to incur significant losses for some time, and we may never operate profitably. From inception through December 31, 2012, we have incurred a substantial accumulated net loss. The revenues that we began to generate from our Gonzales, CA facility in February 2008 have not yet resulted in our earning a profit, and we will continue to incur significant losses for at least the near future. There is no assurance that our operations will ever become profitable. We are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires our management to report on the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must continue an ongoing program of system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We expect that this program will require us to incur significant expenses and to devote additional resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing annual basis. We cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our securities will be affected in the event that our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404. Our future success is dependent on our existing key employees and hiring and assimilating new key employees; our inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future would materially harm our business and results of operations. Our success depends on the continuing efforts and abilities of our current management team. In addition, our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees, including management, technical and sales personnel. We may be unable to identify and attract highly qualified employees in the future. In addition, we may not be able to successfully assimilate these employees or hire qualified personnel to replace them if they leave the Company. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel could materially harm our business and results of operations. We may be unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our products. We currently have limited resources with which to expand our sales and marketing capabilities. Co-promotion or other marketing arrangements to commercialize our planned products could significantly limit the revenues we derive from our products, and the parties with whom we would enter into such agreements may fail to commercialize our products successfully. Our products address different markets and can be offered through multiple sales channels. Addressing each market effectively will require sales and marketing resources tailored to the particular market and to the sales channels that we choose to employ, and we may not be able to develop such specialized marketing resources. Energy and fuel cost variations could adversely affect operating results and expenses. Energy costs, particularly electricity and natural gas, constitute a substantial portion of our operating expenses. The price and supply of energy and natural gas are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including demand for oil and gas, weather, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, and conflict in oil-producing countries. Price escalations in the cost of electricity or reductions in the supply of natural gas could increase operating expenses and negatively affect our results of operations. We may not be able to pass through all or part of the increased energy and fuel costs to our customers. Successful infringement claims by third parties could result in substantial damages, lost product sales and the loss of important proprietary rights. We may have to defend ourselves against patent and other infringement claims asserted by third parties regarding the technology we own or have licensed, resulting in diversion of management focus and additional expenses for the defense of claims. In addition, if a patent infringement suit was brought, we might be forced to stop or delay the development, manufacture or sales of potential products that were claimed to infringe a patent covering a third party’s intellectual property unless that party granted us rights to use its intellectual property. We may be unable to obtain these rights on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses or other such rights on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to continue selling such products. Even if we are able to obtain certain rights to a third party’s patented intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may obtain access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize our potential products or may have to cease some or all of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business. 7 Defects in our products or failures in quality control could impair our ability to sell our products or could result in product liability claims, litigation and other significant events with substantial additional costs. Detection of any significant defects in our products or failure in our quality control procedures may result in, among other things, delay in time-to-market, loss of sales and market acceptance of our products, diversion of development resources, and injury to our reputation. The costs we may incur in correcting any product defects may be substantial. Additionally, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers, which could result in litigation. Product liability litigation, even if we prevail, would be time consuming and costly to defend, and if we do not prevail, could result in the imposition of a damages award. We presently maintain product liability insurance; however, it may not be adequate to cover any claims. Changes in environmental regulations or violations of such regulations could result in increased expense and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and need to maintain our environmental permits, and need to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate our business segments. If for any reason any of these permits are not maintained or granted, construction costs for our facilities may increase, or the facilities may not be constructed at all. Additionally, any changes in environmental laws and regulations, both at the federal and state level, could require us to invest or spend considerable resources in order to comply with future environmental regulations. In 2010, we were fined for alleged environmental violations in connection with the operation of our Woodbridge, NJ facility. Our failure to comply with environmental regulations could cause us to lose our required permits, which could cause the interruption or cessation of our operations. Furthermore, the expense of compliance could be significant enough to adversely affect our operation and have a material negative effect on our financial performance. Our facilities will require certain permits to operate, which we may not be able to obtain at all or obtain on a timely basis. For our Gonzales, CA facility, we have obtained the permits and approvals required to operate the facilities. We may not be able to secure all the necessary permits for future facilities on a timely basis or at all, which may prevent us or potential licensees from operating such facilities according to our business plan. For future facilities, we may need certain permits to operate solid waste or recycling facilities, as well as permits for our sewage connection, water supply, land use, air emission, and wastewater discharge. The specific permit and approval requirements are set by the state and the various local jurisdictions, including but not limited to city, town, county, township, and state agencies having control over the specific properties. Permits once given may be withdrawn. Inability to obtain or maintain permits to construct, operate or maintain our facilities will severely and adversely affect our business. The fertilizer industry is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to generate and grow sales. Chemical fertilizers are manufactured by many companies, are plentiful, and are relatively inexpensive. In addition, there are over 1,700 “crop products” registered as “organic” with the Organic Materials Review Institute, a number that has more than doubled since 2002. If we fail to keep up with changes affecting the markets that we intend to serve, we will become less competitive, thereby adversely affecting our financial performance. Pressure by our customers to reduce prices and agree to long-term supply arrangements may adversely affect our net sales and profit margins. Our current and potential customers, especially large agricultural companies, are often under budgetary pressure and are very price sensitive. Our customers may negotiate supply arrangements with us well in advance of delivery dates, thereby requiring us to commit to product prices before we can accurately determine our final costs. If this happens, we may have to reduce our conversion costs and obtain higher volume orders to offset lower average sales prices. If we are unable to offset lower sales prices by reducing our costs, our gross profit margins will decline, which could have a material negative effect on our financial performance. Our HTLC® technology imposes obligations on us related to infringement actions that may become burdensome. If the use of our HTLC® technology is alleged to infringe the intellectual property of a third party, we may become obligated to defend such infringement action. In such an event, we may become obligated to find alternative technology or to pay a royalty to a third party in order to continue to operate. If a third party is allegedly infringing any of our HTLC® technology, then we may attempt to enforce our intellectual property rights. In general, our possession of rights to use the know-how related to our HTLC® technology will not be sufficient to prevent others from employing similar technology that we believe is infringing. Any such enforcement action against alleged infringers may be required at our expense. The costs of such an enforcement action may be prohibitive, reduce our net income, if any, or prevent us from continuing operations. Our Gonzales, CA and discontinued Woodbridge, NJ facilities, as well as future facility sites, may have unknown environmental problems that could be expensive and time-consuming to correct. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter hazardous environmental conditions at the Gonzales, CA facility site or at any additional future facility sites that may delay the construction of our food waste conversion facilities or require us to incur significant clean-up or correction costs. Upon encountering a hazardous environmental condition, our contractor may suspend work in the affected area. If we receive notice of a hazardous environmental condition, we may be required to correct the condition prior to continuing construction. The presence of a hazardous environmental condition will likely delay construction of the particular facility and may require significant expenditures to correct the environmental condition. If we encounter any hazardous environmental conditions during construction that require time or money to correct, such event could delay our ability to generate revenue. 8 We have little or no experience in the fertilizer industry, which increases the risk of our inability to build or license our facilities and operate our business. We are currently, and are likely for some time to continue to be, dependent upon our present management team. Most of these individuals are experienced both in business generally and in the governance and operation of public companies. However, our present management team does not have experience in organizing the construction, equipping, and start-up of a food waste conversion facility, except for our Gonzales, CA and our former Woodbridge, NJ facilities. In addition, none of our directors has any prior experience in the food waste conversion or fertilizer products industries. As a result, we may not develop our business successfully. The communities where our facilities may be located may be averse to hosting waste handling and manufacturing facilities. Local residents and authorities in communities where our facilities may be located may be concerned about odor, vermin, noise, increased truck traffic, air pollution, decreased property values, and public health risks associated with operating a manufacturing facility in their area. These constituencies may oppose our permitting applications or raise other issues regarding our proposed facilities or bring legal challenges to prevent us from constructing or operating facilities. During the start-up phase at the former Woodbridge, NJ facility, we experienced odor-related issues. As a result of these issues, we were assessed fines from the Health Department of Middlesex County, New Jersey and had been named as a party in a lawsuit by a neighboring business. With respect to the fines assessed by the Health Department, we have negotiated a settlement agreement for the full amount of fines assessed. With respect to the litigation, the plaintiff has alleged various causes of action connected to the odors emanating from the facility and in addition to monetary damages, sought enjoinment of any and all operations which in any way cause or contribute to the alleged pollution. This litigation was eventually dismissed without any finding of wrong doing on our part; however, any new litigation may be subject us to judgments or fines, or our operations may be interrupted or terminated. Even though we have discontinued the operations at our Woodbridge, NJ facility these issues could occur at future owned or licensed facilities. We are dependent on a small number of major customers for our revenues and the loss of any of these major customers would adversely affect our results of operations. Our Gonzales, CA facility relies on a few major customers for a majority of their revenues. During 2012, approximately 58% of the revenues generated by the Gonzales, CA facility were from a total of three customers. During 2011, approximately 53% of the revenues generated by the Gonzales, CA facility were from a total of four customers. We do not have any long-term agreements with any of our customers. The loss of any of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations. We have a significant number of warrants outstanding, and while these warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital. Additionally, certain of these warrants contain anti-dilution and price-protection provisions that may result in the reduction of their exercise prices in the future. In connection with past financings, we have issued a significant number of warrants, certain of which, contain anti-dilution and price-protection provisions that may result in the reduction of their exercise prices in the future. Furthermore, the warrants issued in our January 2012, March 2012 and January 2013 financings, contain price-protection provisions under which, if we were to issue securities at a price lower than the exercise price of such warrants, the exercise price of the warrants would be reduced, with certain exceptions, to the lower price, and the number of shares underlying such warrants would be increased proportionately. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while these warrants are outstanding. If we issue shares of preferred stock, investments in common stock could be diluted or subordinated to the rights of the holders of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized by our Certificate of Incorporation to establish classes or series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Any shares of preferred stock so issued could have priority over our common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable a holder to block such a transaction. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock. Although our Board of Directors is required to make any determination to issue preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, our Board could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which such stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then-market price of such stock. Presently, our Board of Directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to the issuance of currently authorized preferred stock, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules. Although we have no plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to adopt any new series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock, any such action by our Board of Directors or issuance of preferred stock by us could dilute your investment in our common stock and warrants or subordinate your holdings to such shares of preferred stock. Future issuances or sales, or the potential for future issuances or sales, of shares of our common stock, the exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock, or the conversion of convertible notes into our common stock, may cause the trading price of our securities to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through subsequent equity offerings. During 2012, we issued a significant number of shares of our common stock, warrants to acquire shares of our common stock, preferred stock convertible into shares of our common stock, and convertible notes that may be converted into our common stock in connection with various financings and the repayment of debt, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. The additional shares of our common stock issued and to be issued in the future upon the exercise of warrants or options or the conversion of debt could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and could have an adverse effect on our earnings per share if and when we become profitable. In addition, future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock and our Class H warrants to decline, and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities. 9 ITEM 1B.
