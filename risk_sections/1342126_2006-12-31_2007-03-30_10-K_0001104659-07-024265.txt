ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below are risks that we believe are material to investors who purchase or own our securities. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with the other information contained in and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the descriptions included in our consolidated/combined financial statements and accompanying notes. Risks Related to Our Business Boutique hotels are a highly competitive segment of the hospitality industry, which is generally subject to greater volatility than other segments of the industry. As a result, if we are unable to compete effectively or an economic slowdown occurs, our business and operations will be adversely affected by declines in our average daily room rates or occupancy. We generally compete in the boutique hotel segment of the hospitality industry. We believe this segment is highly competitive, is closely linked to general economic conditions and is more susceptible to changes in economic conditions than other segments of the hospitality industry. We believe the boutique hotel segments sensitivity to economic conditions is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. Competition within the boutique hotel segment is also likely to increase in the future. Economic downturns will, among other things, lead to a decrease in our revenues and intense competition may lead to a loss of market share by our hotels, and as a result, our business and operations may be adversely affected. Competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition, quality of service, convenience of location, quality of the property, pricing, and range and quality of food services and amenities offered. Market perception that we no longer provide innovative property concepts and designs would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, we would lose market share, which could adversely affect our business and operations. All of our properties are located in areas with numerous competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than us. In addition, new hotels may be constructed in the areas in which our properties are located, possibly without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. New or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or more convenient locations, services or amenities or significantly expand, improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels compete, thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present. The resulting decrease in our revenues could adversely affect our business and operations. The performance of the hospitality industry, and the boutique hotel segment in particular, has traditionally been closely linked with the general economy. Furthermore, the boutique hotel segment is more susceptible to changes in economic conditions than other segments of the hospitality industry. In an economic downturn, boutique hotels such as ours may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues, as compared to hotels in other segments that have lower room rates. This characteristic may result from the fact that our hotels generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, business and high-end leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or otherwise generally reducing the costs of their trips. In periods of weak demand, profitability is negatively affected by the relatively high fixed costs of operating hotels such as ours, when compared to other segments of the hospitality industry. If an economic slowdown occurs, this could result in declines in average daily room rates or occupancy, or both, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 16 Our success depends on the value of our name, image and brand, and if demand for our hotels and their features decreases or the value of our name, image or brand diminishes, our business and operations would be adversely affected. Our success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to shape and stimulate consumer tastes and demands by producing and maintaining innovative, attractive, and exciting properties and services, as well as our ability to remain competitive in the areas of design and quality. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard or that we will be able to anticipate and react to changing consumer tastes and demands in a timely manner. Furthermore, a high media profile is an integral part of our ability to shape and stimulate demand for our hotels with our target customers. A key aspect of our marketing strategy is to focus on attracting media coverage. If we fail to attract that media coverage, we may need to substantially increase our advertising and marketing costs, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, other types of marketing tools, such as traditional advertising and marketing, may not be successful in attracting our target customers. Our business would be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be diminished. Our brand names and trademarks are integral to our marketing efforts. If the value of our name, image or brands were diminished, our business and operations would be adversely affected. Any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business. We believe our trademarks are critical to our success. We rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights. The success of our business depends in part upon our continued ability to use our trademarks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in both domestic and international markets. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, may result in counterclaims or other claims against us and could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. From time to time, we apply to have certain trademarks registered. There is no guarantee that such trademark registrations will be granted. We cannot assure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business. Use of the Hard Rock brand name by entities other than us could damage the brand and our operations at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We believe our Hard Rock Hotel & Casino property in Las Vegas benefits from the global name recognition and reputation generated by the Hard Rock Cafes that are operated or franchised by the Seminole Tribe of Florida. At March 6, 2007, the Seminole Tribe of Florida operated or franchised over 124 Hard Rock Cafes located in the United States and abroad. The Seminole Tribe of Florida is, however, under no obligation to continue to own, operate or franchise Hard Rock Cafes, and there can be no assurance that it will not sell, change the focus of, or manage, such restaurants in a manner that would adversely affect our Hard Rock Hotel & Casino property in Las Vegas. In addition, although we have obtained the exclusive right to use and develop the Hard Rock Hotel and Hard Rock Casino trademarks in connection with our operations in Las Vegas, and in connection 17 with hotel casinos and casinos in the State of Illinois and all states and possessions of the United States which are located west of the Mississippi River, including the entire state of Louisiana, but excluding Texas, except for the Greater Houston Area, the nations of Australia, Brazil, Israel, and Venezuela, and the Greater Vancouver Area, British Columbia, Canada, the Seminole Tribe of Florida is the sole owner of the rights to the Hard Rock Cafe, Hard Rock Hotel and Hard Rock Casino trademarks. As a result, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, or its licensee, can exploit the Hard Rock name and logo, other than in connection with hotel casinos and casinos in our exclusive territory, including marketing Hard Rock merchandise anywhere in the world. For example, the Seminole Tribe of Florida has licensed the use of the Hard Rock name in connection with its Seminole Hard Rock Hotels in Hollywood and Tampa, Florida. There can be no assurance that our business and results of operations will not be adversely affected by the management or the enforcement of the Hard Rock brand name by parties outside of our control. We may have disputes with, or be sued by, third parties for infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights, which could have a negative impact on our business. Other parties may assert trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights that are important to our business. We cannot assure that others will not seek to block our use of certain marks or seek monetary damages or other remedies for the prior use of our brand names or other intellectual property or the sale of our products or services as a violation of their trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights. Defending any claims, even claims without merit, could divert our managements attention, be time-consuming, result in costly settlements, litigation or restrictions on our business and damage our reputation. In addition, there may be prior registrations or use of trademarks in the United States or foreign countries for similar or competing marks or other proprietary rights of which we are not aware. In all such countries it may be possible for any third-party owner of a national trademark registration or other proprietary right to enjoin or limit our expansion into those countries or to seek damages for our use of such intellectual property in such countries. In the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property or redesign or rename our products or operations to avoid infringement, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. Securing registrations does not fully insulate us against intellectual property claims, as another party may have rights superior to our registration or our registration may be vulnerable to attack on various grounds. Our hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by an economic downturn in these cities or a disaster, such as a terrorist attack. The concentration of our hotels in a limited number of cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic, business and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies. Morgans, Royalton and Hudson, located in Manhattan, represented approximately 39.7% of our guest rooms and approximately $133.5 million, or 47.9%, of our combined revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. Like other hotel markets, the Manhattan hotel market has experienced economic slowdowns in the past, including in the late 1980s, early 1990s and the most recent slowdown, which began in October 2000 and was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A decline in the Manhattan hotel market, in particular, due to a downturn in regional or local economic or business conditions or another terrorist attack or similar disaster would adversely affect occupancy rates and financial performance of our New York hotels and our overall results of operations. In addition, our operations in Las Vegas, including the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and our planned development of the Delano Las Vegas and Mondrian Las Vegas, will increase our geographic concentration in Las Vegas, making us susceptible to economic slowdowns and other factors in this market which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 18 In addition, certain of our hotels are located in markets that are more susceptible to natural disasters than others, which could adversely affect those hotels, the local economies, or both. Specifically, the Miami area, where Delano Miami, Shore Club and Mondrian South Beach are located, is susceptible to hurricanes and California, where Mondrian Los Angeles and Clift are located, is susceptible to earthquakes. A variety of factors affecting the local markets in which our hotels operate, including such natural disasters, could have a material adverse affect on our business and operations. Our operations in Las Vegas, including the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and our planned development of the Delano Las Vegas and Mondrian Las Vegas properties, are subject to intense local competition that could impact our operations and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our operations in Las Vegas, including the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and our planned development of the Delano Las Vegas and Mondrian Las Vegas properties, compete with other high-quality Las Vegas resorts, including those located on the Las Vegas Strip. We believe such competition is based on certain property-specific factors, including overall atmosphere, range of amenities, price, location, entertainment attractions, theme and size. Currently, there are approximately 25 upscale, luxury and midpriced gaming properties located on or near the Las Vegas Strip, six additional upscale, luxury and midpriced gaming properties in the downtown Las Vegas area and additional gaming properties located in other areas of Las Vegas. Many of the competing properties have themes and attractions which draw a significant number of visitors and directly compete with our operations in Las Vegas. Some of these properties are operated by companies that may have greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do and market to the same target demographic group as us. Furthermore, additional hotel casinos containing a significant number of rooms are expected to open in Las Vegas over the next several years, which could significantly increase competition. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Las Vegas market will continue to grow at the current pace or that hotel casino resorts will continue to be popular, and a decline or leveling off of the growth or popularity of such properties would adversely affect our results of operations. The threat of terrorism has adversely affected the hospitality industry generally and these adverse effects may continue or worsen. The threat of terrorism has caused, and may in the future cause, a significant decrease in hotel occupancy and average daily rate, or ADR due to disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. The attacks of September 11, 2001 had a dramatic adverse impact on business and leisure travel and RevPAR. Hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as New York and London that represented approximately 52.7% of our guest rooms at December 31, 2006, were adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety and a significant overall decrease in the amount of air travel, particularly transient business travel, which includes the corporate and premium business segments that generally pay the highest average room rates. The possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and, accordingly, the performance of our business and our operations. We are exposed to the risks of a global market which could hinder our ability to maintain and expand our international operations. We have properties in the United States and the United Kingdom and may expand to other international markets. The success and profitability of any future international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as: · political or economic instability; · changes in governmental regulation; · trade restrictions; 19 · foreign currency controls; · difficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries; · work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions; · taxes; · payments terms; and · seasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world. Furthermore, changes in policies and/or laws of the United States or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations or the expropriation of private enterprises could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international operations. Any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage foreign trade could adversely affect our business relationships and gross profit. In addition, we may be restricted in moving or repatriating funds attributable to our international properties without the approval of foreign governmental authorities or courts. For example, because of our historical net losses in our United Kingdom operations, any funds repatriated from the United Kingdom are considered a return of capital and require court approval. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Establishing operations in any foreign country or region presents risks such as those described above, as well as risks specific to the particular country or region. We may not be able to maintain and expand our international operations successfully, and as a result, our business operations could be adversely affected. We have incurred substantial losses and have a significant net deficit, and we expect that our net losses will continue and remain substantial for the foreseeable future, which may reduce our ability to raise capital. We reported pre-tax net losses of $23.3 million, $41.8 million, $30.8 million, $29.4 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Our net losses primarily reflect our high interest expense and depreciation and amortization charges, which we expect will continue to be significant. We believe that our net losses may continue for the foreseeable future. Our continuing net losses may limit our ability to raise needed financing, or to do so on favorable terms. The hotel business is capital intensive; financing the rising cost of capital improvements and increasing operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our financial performance. Our hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. To compete effectively, we will need to make capital expenditures to maintain our innovative property concepts and designs. In addition, we will need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent approximately $26.0 million for capital improvements and renovations to our hotels and we expect to undertake more capital improvement projects in the future. We may not be able to fund capital improvements solely from cash provided from our operating activities. If not, we will need to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital. In addition, renovations and other capital improvements to our hotels may be expensive and may require us to close all or a portion of the hotels to customers during such renovations, affecting occupancy and ADR. These capital improvements may give rise to the following additional risks, among others: · construction cost overruns and delays; · uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun; · disruption in service and room availability causing reduced demand, occupancy and rates; and 20 · possible environmental problems. As a result, capital improvement projects may increase our expenses and reduce our cash flows and our revenues. If capital expenditures exceed our expectations, this excess would have an adverse effect on our available cash. We have high fixed costs, including property taxes and insurance costs, which we may be unable to adjust in a timely manner in response to a reduction in revenues. In addition, our property taxes have increased in recent years and we expect those increases to continue. The costs associated with owning and operating hotels are significant, some of which may not be altered in a timely manner in response to changes in demand for services, and failure to adjust our expenses may adversely affect our business and operations. For example, pursuant to the terms of our agreements with the labor unions for our New York City and San Francisco hotels, we may not unilaterally reduce the wages of the employees subject to these agreements, and are restricted in the manner in which we may layoff and/or alter the schedule of employees. Property taxes and insurance costs are a significant part of our operating expenses. In recent years, our real property taxes have increased and we expect those increases to continue. Our real property taxes may increase as property tax rates change and as the values of properties are assessed and reassessed by taxing authorities. In addition, our real property tax rates will increase as property tax abatements expire. For example, the property tax abatement applicable to Hudson phases out over a five-year period beginning in 2008. Our real estate taxes do not depend on our revenues, and generally we could not reduce them other than by disposing of our real estate assets. Insurance premiums for the hospitality industry have increased significantly in recent years, and continued escalation may result in our inability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable premium rates. A continuation of this trend would appreciably increase the operating expenses of our hotels. If we do not obtain adequate insurance, to the extent that any of the events not covered by an insurance policy materialize, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In the future, our properties may be subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses, which could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our financial performance. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our expenses in a timely manner, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our strategy to acquire and develop or redevelop hotels creates timing, financing, operational and other risks that may adversely affect our business and operations. We intend to acquire and develop or redevelop hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise. For example, we are currently developing two properties in Las VegasDelano Las Vegas and Mondrian Las Vegas, and one property in South BeachMondrian South Beach. The acquisition, development and redevelopment of hotel properties involve a number of risks. There can be no assurance that any development or redevelopment project will be completed on time or within budget. Our inability to complete a project on time or within budget may adversely affect our operating results and financial performance. Acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects of hotel properties require significant capital expenditures. In addition, development or redevelopment of properties usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects completion. We will not be able to fund acquisitions and development or redevelopment projects solely from cash provided from our operating activities. Consequently, we will rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and development or redevelopment. Our ability to grow through acquisitions, development or redevelopment of hotels will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, 21 market conditions. Neither our charter nor our by-laws limits the amount of debt that we can incur. However, no assurances can be made that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. We may not be able to successfully compete for additional hotel properties. We may not be successful in identifying or completing acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy. We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, real estate investment trusts, owner-operators of hotels and others who are engaged in real estate investment activities for the acquisition of hotels, which may or may not have similar investment objectives as we do. In addition, competition for suitable investment properties may increase in the future. Some competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and, as such, will be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. These competitors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities for us by driving up the price we must pay for real property or other assets we seek to acquire. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources, be willing to pay more, have a more compatible operating philosophy, or better relationships with hotel franchisors, seller or lenders. Even if we are able to successfully identify and acquire other hotel properties, acquisitions may not yield the returns we expect and, if financed using our equity capital, may be dilutive. We also may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions, including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to the standards established for its intended market position or the costs to integrate an acquired hotel property with our existing operations. Significant costs of acquisitions could materially impact our operating results, including costs of uncompleted acquisitions as they would generally be expensed in the time period during which they are incurred. Integration of new hotels may be difficult and may adversely affect our business and operations. The success of any acquisition or development project will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating acquired hotels with our existing operations. For instance, we may develop or acquire new hotels in geographic areas in which our management may have little or no operating experience and in which potential customers may not be familiar with our existing hotels, name, image or brands. Our recently completed acquisition of the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, our development of the Delano Las Vegas and Mondrian Las Vegas and our acquisition and recent rebranding of the Mondrian Scottsdale are in new cities where we previously did not own hotel properties. These hotels may attract fewer customers than our existing hotels, while at the same time, we may incur substantial additional costs with these new hotel properties. As a result, the results of operations at new hotel properties may be inferior to those of our existing hotels. Until recently, none of our individual hotel brands were used for more than one hotel. Extension of our brands may jeopardize what we believe are the distinct reputations of our existing properties. Unanticipated expenses and insufficient demand at a new hotel property, therefore, could adversely affect our business. Our success in realizing anticipated benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of the acquired hotel. This integration is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The difficulties of combining acquired properties with our existing operations include, among others: · coordinating sales, distribution and marketing functions; · integrating information systems; · preserving the important licensing, distribution, marketing, customer, labor, and other relationships of an acquired hotel; 22 · costs relating to the opening, operation and promotion of new hotel properties that are substantially greater than those incurred in other geographic areas; and · converting hotels to our brand. We may not accomplish the integration of acquired hotels smoothly or successfully. The diversion of the attention of our management from our existing operations to integration efforts and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits from the acquisition and could adversely affect our business and operations. The use of joint ventures or other entities, over which we may not have full control, for hotel acquisitions could prevent us from achieving our objectives. We have in the past and may in the future acquire, develop or redevelop hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, joint venture or other entity. For example, we currently are party to a joint venture with Boyd to develop our Delano Las Vegas and Mondrian Las Vegas properties. We also own our St. Martins Lane and Sanderson hotels in London through a 50/50 joint venture with Walton and the Hard Rock through our one third interest in a joint venture with DLJMB. To the extent we own properties through joint ventures or other entities, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, joint venture or other entity. Investments in joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Likewise, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions if neither we nor our partner have full control over the joint venture or other entity. Disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, our partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our partners. We have recently invested, and may continue to invest in the future, in select non-hotel properties, such as condominium or other residential projects, and this strategy may not yield the returns we expect, may result in disruptions to our business or strain management resources. As part of our growth strategy, we may seek to leverage awareness of our hotel brands by acquiring, developing and/or managing non-hotel properties, such as condominium developments and other residential projects, including condominiums or apartments. We may invest in these opportunities solely or with joint venture partners. For example, in August 2006, together with a 50/50 joint venture partner, we acquired an apartment building in the South Beach area of Miami, Florida, which we intend to renovate and convert into a hotel and condominium project and re-brand under our Mondrian brand name as Mondrian South Beach. This strategy, however, may expose us to additional risks, including the following: · we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development or re-development costs and/or lower than expected sales; · local residential real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand, may result in reduced or fluctuating sales; 23 · cost overruns, including development or re-development costs that exceed our original estimates, could make completion of the project uneconomical; · land, insurance and development or re-development costs continue to increase and may continue to increase in the future and we may be unable to attract rents, or sales prices that compensate for these increases in costs; · development or re-development of condominium properties usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects completion and the sale of a significant number of condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such condominium units are sold; · failure to achieve expected occupancy and/or rent levels at residential apartment properties within the projected time frame, if at all; and · we may abandon development or re-development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities. If any of these problems occur, overall project costs may significantly exceed the costs that were estimated when the project was originally undertaken, which will result in reduced returns, or even losses, from our investment. We have substantial debt, and we may incur additional indebtedness, which may negatively affect our business and financial results. As of December 31, 2006, we had $553.2 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our indebtedness and the covenants applicable to our indebtedness are described under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Our substantial debt may negatively affect our business and operations in several ways, including: · requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to make required payments on principal and interest, which will reduce funds available for operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes; · making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; · limiting our ability to borrow more money for operations, capital or to finance acquisitions in the future; and · requiring us to dispose of properties in order to make required payments of interest and principal. Our revolving credit facility and trust preferred securities contain financial and operating covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios and other limitations on our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain acquisitions. Failure to meet these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of debt or changes in general economic conditions. These covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our other debt instruments. This could cause one or more of our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments on their respective indebtedness, which could harm our business and operations. Some of our existing indebtedness contain limitations on our ability to incur additional debt on specific properties, as well as financial covenants relating to the performance of those properties. If these 24 covenants restrict us from engaging in activities that we believe would benefit those properties, our growth may be limited. If we fail to comply with these covenants, we will need to obtain consents or waivers from compliance with these covenants, which may take time or cause us to incur additional expenses, or we may be required to prepay the debt containing the restrictive covenants. A majority of our debt is secured by first deeds of trust on our properties. If we were to default on our secured debt, the loss of property securing the debt would harm our ability to satisfy other obligations. Using our properties as collateral increases our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure and ultimately our loss of the property that secures any loans for which we are in default. For tax purposes, a foreclosure on any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure but would not receive any cash proceeds. In addition, because of various cross-default provisions in our debt, our default under some of our mortgage debt obligations may result in a default on our other indebtedness. If this occurs, our business and operations would be materially adversely affected. We also will likely incur additional debt in connection with any future acquisitions. We may, in some instances, borrow under our revolving credit facility or borrow other funds to acquire properties. In addition, we may incur further mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by the properties we acquire or our existing portfolio. Our working capital and liquidity reserves may not be adequate to cover all of our cash needs and we may have to obtain additional debt financing. Sufficient financing may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us. Additional borrowings for working capital purposes will increase our interest expense, and therefore may harm our business and operations. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. If we increase our leverage, the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and harm our business and operations. We anticipate that we will refinance our indebtedness from time to time to repay our debt, and our inability to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, could harm our business and operations. Since we anticipate that our internally generated cash will be inadequate to repay our indebtedness prior to maturity, we expect that we will be required to repay debt from time to time through refinancings of our indebtedness and/or offerings of equity or debt. The amount of our existing indebtedness may harm our ability to repay our debt through refinancings. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to sell one or more of our properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. We have placed mortgages on our hotel properties to secure our indebtedness. To the extent we cannot meet our debt service obligations, we risk losing some or all of those properties to foreclosures. If prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of any refinancing result in higher interest rates on any refinancing, our interest expense would increase, which would harm our business and operations. Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply. Our revolving credit facility contains financial and operating covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios and other limitations on our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets, pay dividends on our common stock and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain acquisitions. Failure to meet these financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of debt or changes in general economic conditions. These covenants may restrict our ability 25 to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under one or more of our other debt instruments. This could cause one or more of our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments on their respective indebtedness, which could harm our business and operations. Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates. We use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. When interest rates change, we may be required to record a gain or loss on those derivatives that we currently hold. Our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps and floors and options to purchase these items. We currently use interest rate caps to manage our interest rate risks related to our variable rate indebtedness; however, our actual hedging decisions will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time and may differ from our currently anticipated hedging strategy. There can be no assurance that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses, and such losses could harm our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Our operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks, and we cannot predict the impact of future exchange-rate fluctuations on our business and operating results. Our operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our operating results. For example, all else being equal, a weaker U.S. dollar will promote international tourism in our domestic markets. As foreign currencies appreciate against the U.S. dollar, it becomes less expensive, in terms of those appreciating foreign currencies, to pay for our United States hotel services. Conversely, all else being equal, an appreciating U.S. dollar could affect demand for our United States hotel services. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange-rate fluctuations on our business and operations. Our management has limited experience managing a public company. Until recently, our management team has operated our business as a privately owned limited liability company and has limited experience managing a publicly owned company. We continue to develop control systems and procedures adequate to support a public company and this transition could place a significant strain on our management systems, infrastructure, overhead and other resources. Given our recent organization and our managements experience, stockholders may be unable to fully evaluate our managements public company abilities. We may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a public companys financial statements must attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of the companys internal controls over financial reporting. We are evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow our management to report on our internal controls as a required part of our annual report beginning with fiscal year 2007 and to allow our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our internal controls as a required part of our annual report beginning with fiscal year 2007. 26 While we have spent significant resources in 2006 and expect to expend significant resources during fiscal year 2007 in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby. Because of the difficulty of measuring compliance adequacy, we cannot assure you that we will receive an unqualified opinion on the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. If we or our auditors identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we receive an adverse opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing could be adversely affected. In addition to the above, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls over financial reporting in connection with their audit of our financial statements, and in the further event that they are unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy themselves as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures, it is possible that we could receive a qualified or adverse audit opinion on those financial statements. In that event, the market for our common stock could be adversely affected. We depend on our key personnel for the future success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and implement our growth strategies, or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. Our future success and our ability to manage future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts and continued service of our senior management team who has substantial experience in the hospitality industry. For example, our President and Chief Executive Officer, W. Edward Scheetz, and our Chairman, David Hamamoto, have been actively involved in the acquisition and ownership of hotel assets and are actively engaged in our management. Messrs. Scheetz and Hamamoto substantially determine our strategic direction, especially with regard to operational, financing, acquisition and disposition activity. The departure of either of them could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. It could be difficult for us to find replacements for our key personnel, as competition for such personnel is intense. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and implement our growth strategies. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could reduce the market value of our securities. The recent departure of our founder and certain members of our development and design teams could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and implement our growth strategies. On June 24, 2005, Ian Schrager, our then Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, resigned. Ian Schrager founded our predecessor company in 1983 and was involved with all aspects of our business. In addition, certain members of our development and design team who have left our Company in recent years were closely involved in the acquisition, development and design of many of our current properties. No assurances can be made that the loss of Ian Schrager and other employees in our development and design teams will not have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and implement our growth strategies. 27 We depend on Jeffrey Chodorow for the management of our restaurants and certain of our bars. The restaurants in Morgans, Hudson, Delano Miami, Mondrian Los Angeles, Clift, Sanderson and St. Martins Lane as well as the bars in Delano Miami, Sanderson and St. Martins Lane are owned and managed through several joint venture operations with restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow pursuant to a master agreement between our subsidiaries and Chodorow Ventures LLC. Our restaurant in Mondrian Scottsdale is owned by the Company and operated under license and management agreements with a related entity to Chodorow Ventures LLC. If any of the risks outlined below materialize, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The joint ventures involve risks not otherwise present in our business, including: · the risk that Mr. Chodorow or Chodorow Ventures LLC has economic or other interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests and goals and that he may not take, or may veto, actions which may be in our best interests; · the risk that a joint venture entity or Chodorow Ventures LLC may default on its obligations under the agreement or the leases with our hotels, or not renew those leases when they expire, and therefore we may not continue to receive its services; · the risk that disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business; · the risk that we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners or co-venturers; and · the risk that Chodorow Ventures LLC may become bankrupt and will be unable to continue to provide services to us. We depend on Golden Gaming to serve as the operator of the casino at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas and to the extent Golden Gaming fails to provide these services, fails to make lease payments or if we were to become liable to third parties for the actions of Golden Gaming at the property, our cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted. We lease the casino at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas to a licensed operator and are prohibited from receiving any revenues of the casino at this property until we have obtained the necessary gaming approvals. As such, we have entered into a definitive lease agreement with an affiliate of Golden Gaming, Inc. (Golden Gaming) for all gaming and related activities at the propertys approximately 30,000 square foot casino. Therefore, a portion of our revenues from the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is dependent on our ability to collect lease payments from Golden Gaming. To the extent that Golden Gaming defaults on its obligations under its lease with us, whether as a result of any dispute between the parties, because of a deterioration of its financial condition, bankruptcy or otherwise, or if we become liable to third parties for the actions of Golden Gaming as casino operator, our cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted. Because land underlying Sanderson is subject to a 150-year ground lease, Clift is leased pursuant to a 99-year lease and a portion of Hudson is the lease of a condominium interest, we are subject to the risk that these leases could be terminated and could cause us to lose the ability to operate these hotels. Our rights to use the land underlying Sanderson in London are based upon our interest under a 150-year ground lease. Our rights to operate Clift in San Francisco are based upon our interest under a 99-year lease. In addition, a portion of Hudson in New York is a condominium interest that is leased to us. Pursuant to the terms of the leases for these hotels, we are required to pay all rent due and comply with all other lessee obligations under the leases. Any transfer, including a pledge, of our interest in a lease may 28 require the consent of the applicable lessor and its lenders. As a result, we may not be able to sell, assign, transfer or convey our lessees interest in any hotel subject to a lease in the future absent consent of such third parties even if such transactions may be in the best interest of our stockholders. The lessor may require us, at the expiration or termination of the lease to surrender or remove any improvements, alterations or additions to the land or hotel at our own expense. The leases also generally require us to restore the premises following a casualty or taking and to apply in a specified manner any proceeds received in connection therewith. We may have to restore the premises if a material casualty, such as a fire or an act of God, occurs, the cost of which may exceed any available insurance proceeds. The termination of any of these leases could cause us to lose the ability to continue operating these hotels, which would materially affect our business and results of operations. We are party to numerous contracts and operating agreements, certain of which limit our activities through restrictive covenants or consent rights. Violation of those covenants or failure to receive consents could lead to termination of those contracts or operating agreements. We are party to numerous contracts and operating agreements, many of which are integral to our business operations. Certain of those contracts and operating agreements, including our joint venture agreements, generally require that we obtain the consent of the other party or parties before taking certain actions and/or contain restrictive covenants that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants or failure to obtain consents, including actions by our predecessor prior to our initial public offering, could provide the beneficiaries of those covenants or consents with the right to terminate the relevant contract or operating agreement or seek damages against us. If those claims relate to agreements that are integral to our operations, any termination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We are currently involved in litigation regarding our management of Shore Club. This litigation may harm our business or reputation and defense of this litigation may divert management resources from the operations of our business. In 2002, we invested in Shore Club and our management company, MHG Management Company, took over management of the property. The management agreement pursuant to which we manage Shore Club expires in 2022. On January 17, 2006, Phillips South Beach LLC, the entity that owns Shore Club, filed a lawsuit in New York state court against MHG Management Company. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, (i) that MHG Management Company engaged in fraudulent or willful misconduct with respect to Shore Club entitling Phillips South Beach LLC to terminate the Shore Club management agreement without the payment of a termination fee to us, (ii) breach of fiduciary duty by MHG Management Company, (iii) tortious interference with business relations by redirecting guests and events from Shore Club to Delano Miami, (iv) misuse of free and complimentary rooms at Shore Club, and (v) misappropriation of confidential business information. The allegations include that MHG Management Company took actions to benefit Delano Miami at the expense of Shore Club, billed Shore Club for expenses that had already been billed by us as part of chain expenses, misused barter agreements to obtain benefits for our employees, and failed to collect certain rent and taxes from retail tenants. The lawsuit also asserts that MHG Management Company falsified or omitted information in monthly management reports related to the alleged actions. Messrs. Schrager, Scheetz and Hamamoto are also named as defendants in the lawsuit. The remedies sought by Phillips South Beach LLC include (a) termination of the management agreement without the payment of a termination fee to MHG Management Company, (b) a full accounting of all of the affairs of Shore Club from the inception of the management agreement, (c) at least 29 $5.0 million in compensatory damages, (d) at least $10.0 million in punitive damages, and (e) attorneys fees, interests, costs and disbursements. We intend to challenge this litigation vigorously. There can be no assurances, however, that the outcome of the litigation, or the costs and diversion of management resources associated with the defense of the litigation, will not harm our reputation in the hospitality industry or otherwise adversely affect our business and result of operations. Risks Related to the Hospitality Industry In addition to the risks enumerated above, a number of factors, many of which are common to the hospitality industry and beyond our control, could affect our business, including the following: · increased threat of terrorism, terrorist events, airline strikes, natural disasters or other factors that may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates; · increased competition from other hotels in our markets; · new hotel supply in our markets, which could harm our occupancy levels and revenue at our hotels; · dependence on business and commercial travel, leisure travel and tourism; · increases in operating costs due to inflation, labor costs (including the impact of unionization), workers compensation and health-care related costs, utility costs, insurance and unanticipated costs such as acts of nature and their consequences and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates; · changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing; · changes in laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances; · adverse effects of international market conditions, which may diminish the desire for high-end leisure travel or the need for business travel, as well as national, regional and local economic and market conditions where our hotels operate and where our customers live; and · adverse effects of a downturn in the hospitality industry. These factors could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. Our revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters. Our quarterly earnings may also be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including weather conditions and poor economic conditions. As a result, we may have to enter into short-term borrowings in certain quarters in order to offset these fluctuations in revenues. The industries in which we operate are heavily regulated and a failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in an adverse effect on our business. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements this may result in an adverse effect on our business. Our various properties are subject to numerous laws, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, including alcohol. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our employees in such areas as minimum wage and maximum working hours, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing employees and work permits. Also, our ability to remodel, refurbish or add to our existing properties may be dependent upon our obtaining necessary building permits from local authorities. The failure to obtain any of these permits could adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and net income through capital improvements of our properties. In addition, we are subject to the numerous rules and regulations relating to state and federal taxation. Compliance with these rules and regulations requires significant management attention. Any failure to comply with all such rules and regulations could subject us to fines or audits by the applicable taxation authority. 30 In addition, as a result of our recent acquisition of the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, the casino operations at that property are subject to gaming industry regulations. The gaming industry is highly regulated, and the casino must maintain its licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue operations. The casino is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it operates. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws could result in, among other things, disciplinary action. The illiquidity of real estate investments and the lack of alternative uses of hotel properties could significantly limit our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more of our properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Although we evaluate alternative uses throughout our portfolio, including residential conversion and other opportunities, hotel properties may not readily be converted to alternative uses. The conversion of a hotel to alternative uses would also generally require substantial capital expenditures and may not provide a more profitable return than the use of the hotel property prior to that conversion. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We may not have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements and as a result our ability to sell the property would be limited. In acquiring a hotel, we may agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that hotel for a period of time or impose other restrictions on us. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations. Uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are responsible for insuring our hotel properties as well as for obtaining the appropriate insurance coverage to reasonably protect our interests in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, each of our leases and loans typically specifies that comprehensive insurance be maintained on each of our hotel properties, including liability, fire and extended coverage. There are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes and floods or terrorist acts, which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be subject to insurance coverage limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. We will use our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits, deductibility provisions of insurance and the appropriateness of self-insuring, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. Uninsured and underinsured losses could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to our hotels or to persons at our hotels. Claims, whether or not they have merit, could harm the reputation of a hotel or cause us to incur expenses to the extent of insurance deductibles or losses in excess of policy limitations, which could harm our results of operations. In the event of a catastrophic loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost investment. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. In the event of a significant loss, our deductible may be high and we may be required to pay for all such repairs and, as a consequence, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using 31 insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under those circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property. Since September 11, 2001, it has generally become more difficult and expensive to obtain property and casualty insurance, including coverage for terrorism. When our current insurance policies expire, we may encounter difficulty in obtaining or renewing property or casualty insurance on our properties at the same levels of coverage and under similar terms. Such insurance may be more limited and for some catastrophic risks (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, flood and terrorism) may not be generally available at current levels. Even if we are able to renew our policies or to obtain new policies at levels and with limitations consistent with our current policies, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain such insurance at premium rates that are commercially reasonable. If we were unable to obtain adequate insurance on our properties for certain risks, it could cause us to be in default under specific covenants on certain of our indebtedness or other contractual commitments that require us to maintain adequate insurance on our properties to protect against the risk of loss. If this were to occur, or if we were unable to obtain adequate insurance and our properties experienced damage which would otherwise have been covered by insurance, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition and the operations of our properties. In addition, insurance coverage for our hotel properties and for casualty losses does not customarily cover damages that are characterized as punitive or similar damages. As a result, any claims or legal proceedings, or settlement of any such claims or legal proceedings that result in damages that are characterized as punitive or similar damages may not be covered by our insurance. If these types of damages are substantial, our financial resources may be adversely affected. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations could increase our compliance costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our hotel properties are subject to various Federal, state and local laws relating to the environment, fire and safety and access and use by disabled persons. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require us, if we are the owner of a contaminated property, to clean up the property, even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. These laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated. In addition to the costs of clean-up, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owners ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property. Under such environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, to pay for the clean-up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment. Furthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos while staying in or working at a hotel may seek to recover damages for injuries suffered. Additionally, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. For example, some laws require a business using chemicals (such as swimming pool chemicals at a hotel) to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used. We could be responsible for the types of costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. Future laws or regulations may impose material environmental liabilities on us, or the current environmental condition of our hotel properties may be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our hotels (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us. 32 Our hotel properties are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet various Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADAs requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in the United States government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages. If we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotels, whether to comply with the ADA or other changes in governmental rules and regulations, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we are required to operate our hotel properties and laundry facilities in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and become applicable to our properties. Our hotels may be faced with labor disputes or, upon expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, a strike, which would adversely affect the operation of our hotels. We rely heavily on our employees providing high-quality personal service at our hotels and any labor dispute or stoppage caused by poor relations with a labor union or the hotels employees could adversely affect our ability to provide those services, which could reduce occupancy and room revenue, tarnish our reputation and hurt our results of operations. Most of our employees who work at Morgans, Royalton, Hudson and Clift are members of local labor unions. Our relationship with our employees or the union could deteriorate due to disputes relating to, among other things, wage or benefit levels or management responses to various economic and industry conditions. The collective bargaining agreement governing the terms of employment for employees working in our New York City hotels will not expire until June 30, 2012. The collective bargaining agreement governing the terms of employment for the majority of the employees working in our Clift hotel will not expire until August 14, 2009. Risks Related to Our Organization and Corporate Structure We are a holding company with no operations. We are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. We do not have, apart from our ownership of Morgans Group LLC and a non-equity voting interest in Hard Rock Hotel Holdings, LLC, any independent operations. As a result and although we have no current plan to do so, we will rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from Morgans Group LLC and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock. We will also rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from Morgans Group LLC and our other subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations. The ability of Morgans Group LLC and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on Morgans Group LLCs operating results. In addition, because we are a holding company, claims of our stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. Substantially all of our businesses are held through our direct subsidiary, Morgans Group LLC. Other than with respect to 1,000,000 membership units held by the Predecessor and membership units issued as part of our employee compensation plans, we own all the outstanding membership units of Morgans Group LLC. We may, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise, issue additional membership units of Morgans Group LLC in the future. Such issuances would reduce our ownership of Morgans Group LLC. Because our stockholders do not directly own Morgans Group LLC units, they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other corporate level activities of Morgans Group LLC. 33 Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could limit the price certain investors might be willing to pay for our stock. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit changes in control of our Company not approved by our board of directors or changes in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These provisions include: · a prohibition on stockholder action through written consents; · a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called by the board of directors; · advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; · limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal the by-laws; and · the authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and additional shares of our common stock. We also are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquires such status unless certain board or stockholder approvals are obtained. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We may experience conflicts of interest with a significant stockholder and that stockholder may also exercise significant influence over our affairs. Our largest stockholder, NorthStar Capital Investment Corp., which we refer to as NCIC, beneficially owned approximately 30.3%, of the outstanding shares of our common stock at December 31, 2006. We may experience conflicts of interest in connection with competition with NCIC and its affiliates over the acquisition or disposition of hotel properties. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, W. Edward Scheetz, and our Chairman, David Hamamoto, are directors and the Co-Chief Executive Officers of NCIC. In addition, Mr. Hamamoto is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Northstar Realty Finance Corp., an affiliate of NCIC. We believe that Mr. Scheetz devoted substantially all of his business time to the performance of his duties as our President and Chief Executive Officer in 2006, and we expect Mr. Scheetz to continue to do so in the future. In addition, Mr. Scheetz is subject to a noncompetition agreement with us. We believe Mr. Hamamoto, as our Chairman, has devoted an amount of time customary for the performance of his duties as Chairman in 2006, and we expect Mr. Hamamoto to continue to do so in the future. Messrs. Scheetz and Hamamotos management obligations to NCIC and its affiliates may present them with conflicts of interest in making decisions and their time spent managing NCIC will reduce the time and effort they each spend managing us. Under Delaware corporate law, our officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders. However, we have not instituted a formal plan or arrangement to address potential conflicts of interest that may arise among us, NCIC and its affiliates. Some of our officers may also serve as directors or officers of NCIC and may have conflicts of interest because they may own equity interests in NCIC, or its affiliates, or they may receive cash- or equity-based awards based on the performance of NCIC, or its affiliates. Messrs. Scheetz and Hamamoto are directors and officers of NCIC. In addition, the shares of common stock owned by NCIC constitute a significant portion of the votes needed to approve matters required to be submitted to our stockholders for approval, including decisions relating to the election of our board of directors, and the determination of our day-to-day corporate and management policies. The ownership interest in our company of our significant stockholders may 34 discourage third parties from seeking to acquire control of our company which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If a third-party acquires all or a controlling interest in NCIC, or its affiliates, that third-party may be able to significantly influence us in the same manner that NCIC is now able to significantly influence us. We may experience conflicts of interest with certain of our directors and officers and significant stockholders as a result of their tax positions. Messrs. Scheetz and Hamamoto and Marc Gordon, our Chief Investment Officer and Executive Vice President of Capital Markets, may suffer adverse tax consequences upon our sale of certain properties and may therefore have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of a particular propertys sale. At the completion of our IPO, Morgans Hotel Group LLC guaranteed approximately $225.0 million of the indebtedness of subsidiaries of Morgans Group LLC and Messrs. Scheetz, Hamamoto and Gordon agreed to reimburse Morgans Hotel Group LLC for up to $98.3 million, $98.3 million and $7.0 million of its guarantee obligation, respectively. These guarantees and reimbursement undertakings were provided so that Messrs. Scheetz, Hamamoto and Gordon did not realize taxable capital gains in connection with the Formation and Structuring Transactions in the amount that each has agreed to reimburse. The guarantees and reimbursement undertakings are for a fixed term and are renewable at the option of the provider. Messrs. Scheetz, Hamamoto and Gordon may influence us to not sell or refinance certain properties, even if such sale or refinancing might be financially advantageous to our stockholders, in order for them to avoid realizing built-in gains that would be incurred once they ceased to agree to reimburse Morgans Hotel Group LLC for its guarantee of portions of our debt. Alternatively, to avoid realizing such built-in gains they may have to agree to additional reimbursements or guarantees involving additional financial risk. In addition, Messrs. Scheetz, Hamamoto and Gordon may be subject to tax on a disproportionately large amount of the built-in gain that would be realized upon the sale of certain properties. Messrs. Scheetz, Hamamoto and Gordon may therefore influence us to not sell certain properties, even if such sale might be financially advantageous to our stockholders, or to enter into tax deferred exchanges with the proceeds of such sales when such a reinvestment might not otherwise be in our best interest, as they may wish to avoid realization of their share of the built-in gains in those properties. Our basis in the hotels contributed to us is generally substantially less than their fair market value which will decrease the amount of our depreciation deductions and increase the amount of recognized gain upon sale. Some of the hotels which were part of the Formation and Structuring Transactions were contributed to us in tax-free transactions. Accordingly, our basis in the assets contributed was not adjusted in connection with our IPO and is generally substantially less than the fair market value of the contributed hotels as of the date of our IPO. We also intend to generally use the traditional method for making allocations under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code as opposed to the curative or remedial method for making such allocations. Consequently, (i) our depreciation deductions with respect to our hotels will likely be substantially less than the depreciation deductions that would have been available to us had our tax basis been equal to the fair market value of the hotels as of the date of our IPO and (ii) we may recognize gain upon the sale of an asset that is attributable to appreciation in the value of the asset that accrued prior to the date of our IPO. Upon an indirect transfer of an interest in our three New York City hotels as a result of subsequent sales of our common stock by NCIC or RSA Associates, L.P., we may be obligated to pay New York City and New York State transfer tax based on the value of our three New York hotels. Upon a transfer of a controlling interest in our three New York City hotels, New York City and New York State assess a real property transfer tax that aggregates approximately 3% of the fair market value of those hotels. Under the applicable regulations, subject to certain exceptions, a transfer of a 50% or greater 35 interest in our company, either as a result of our IPO or as a result of our IPO aggregated with sales by NCIC or RSA Associates, L.P., which we refer to as RSA Associates , would constitute a sale of a controlling interest in our New York City hotels, giving rise to a tax on the aggregate percentage interest transferred. We have agreed with NCIC and RSA Associates to pay any transfer tax resulting from sales of our common stock by them. In connection with our IPO, there was a transfer of a controlling interest in our company that resulted in a transfer tax payable by us to New York City and New York State based on the aggregate interest transferred and the fair market value of our New York City hotels at the time of our IPO. In addition, if NCIC and RSA Associates subsequently transfer an interest in our company in a transaction that the applicable rules aggregate with our IPO, an additional transfer tax would be payable by us to New York City and New York State based on the aggregate interest subsequently transferred and the fair market value of our New York City hotels at the time of the transfer. Non-U.S. holders owning more than 5% of our common stock may be subject to United States federal income tax on gain recognized on the disposition of our common stock. Because of our significant United States real estate holdings, we believe that we are a United States real property holding corporation as defined under Section 897 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, any non-U.S. holder (as defined under Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders) will be subject to United States federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if such non-U.S. holder has held, directly or indirectly, 5% of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition and such non-U.S. holder is not eligible for any treaty exemption. Substantial sales of shares of our common stock may adversely impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to issue and sell shares in the future. Most of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for resale in the public market and certain holders of our shares have the right to require us to file a registration statement for purposes of registering their shares for resale. A significant portion of these shares is held by a small number of stockholders. For example, NCIC was the beneficial owner of approximately 30.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at December 31, 2006. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline, which may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. We are unable to predict the effect that sales of our common stock may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, 3,500,000 shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to our 2006 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and our Annual Bonus Plan. Sales of shares issued under our stock incentive plan and our annual bonus plan, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. ITEM 1B.
