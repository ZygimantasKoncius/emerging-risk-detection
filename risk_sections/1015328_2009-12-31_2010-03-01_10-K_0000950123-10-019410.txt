ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect Wintrust are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair Wintrusts business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Difficult economic conditions have adversely affected our company and the financial services industry in general and further deterioration may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. economy has been in recession since the third quarter of 2008, and the housing and real estate markets have been experiencing extraordinary slowdowns since 2007. Additionally, unemployment rates have continued to rise during these periods. These factors have had a significant negative effect on us and other companies in the financial services industry. As a lending institution, our business is directly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, as well as by the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures many of our loans. Market turmoil has led to an increase in charge-offs and has negatively impacted consumer confidence and the level of business activity. Net charge-offs were $137.4 million in 2009 and $37.0 million in 2008. Although non-performing loans decreased to $131.8 million as of December 31, 2009 from $231.7 million at September 30, 2009 and $136.1 million as of December 31, 2008, other real estate owned (OREO) increased to $80.2 million at December 31, 2009 from $40.6 million at September 30, 2009 and $32.6 million at December 31, 2008. Continued weakness or further deterioration in the economy, real estate markets or unemployment rates, particularly in the markets in which we operate, will likely diminish the ability of our borrowers to repay loans that we have given them, the value of any collateral securing such loans and may cause increases in delinquencies, problem assets, charge-offs and provision for credit losses, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted may not prevent losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Since our business is concentrated in the greater Chicago and southeast Wisconsin metropolitan areas, further declines in the economy of this region could adversely affect our business. Except for our premium finance business and certain other niche businesses, our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the greater Chicago and southeast Wisconsin metropolitan areas. The local economic conditions in these areas significantly impact the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. Specifically, most of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate located in the Chicago metropolitan area. Our local market area has experienced recent negative changes in overall market conditions relating to real estate valuation. As troubled assets are liquidated into the market, the additional supply is driving appraised valuations of real estate much lower. Further declines in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors with impact on these local markets could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Continued deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for mortgage loans is located could adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan, and in turn the value of our assets. If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio, our financial condition and liquidity could suffer. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that is intended to absorb credit losses that we expect to incur in our loan portfolio. At each balance sheet date, our management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses based on our estimate of probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio, taking into account probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Because our allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of probable losses, there is no certainty that it will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio, particularly in the case of continued adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events that adversely affect specific customers. For example, in 2009, we charged off $137.4 million in loans (net of recoveries) and increased our allowance for loan losses from $69.8 million at December 31, 2008 to $98.3 million at 19 Table of Contents December 31, 2009 as a result of the economic recession and financial crisis. Our allowance for loan losses represents 1.17% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2009, compared to 0.92% at December 31, 2008. This increase is primarily the result of deterioration in our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios, which comprised 60% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2009. Estimating loan loss allowances for our newer banks is more difficult because rapidly growing and de novo bank loan portfolios are, by their nature, unseasoned. Therefore, our newer bank subsidiaries may be more susceptible to changes in estimates, and to losses exceeding estimates, than banks with more seasoned loan portfolios. Although we believe our loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio, if our estimates are inaccurate and our actual loan losses exceed the amount that is anticipated, our financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. For more information regarding our allowance for loan losses, see Allowance for Loan Losses under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Unanticipated changes in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income, which is our largest source of income. Wintrust is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since changes in prevailing interest rates affect the value of our assets and liabilities. Such changes may adversely affect our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Net interest income represents our largest source of net income, and was $311.9 million and $244.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In particular, our net interest income is affected by the fact that assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. Each of our businesses may be affected differently by a given change in interest rates. For example, we expect the results of our mortgage banking business in selling loans into the secondary market would be negatively impacted during periods of rising interest rates, whereas falling interest rates could have a negative impact on the net interest spread earned as we would be unable to lower the rates on many interest bearing deposit accounts of our customers to the same extent as many of our higher yielding asset classes. Additionally, changes in interest rates may adversely influence the growth rate of loans and deposits, the quality of our loan portfolio, loan and deposit pricing, the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business and the value that we can recognize on the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market. We seek to mitigate our interest rate risk through several strategies, which may not be successful. For example, with the relatively low interest rates that prevailed in recent years, we were able to augment the total return of our investment securities portfolio by selling call options on fixed-income securities that we own. We recorded fee income of approximately $2.0 million, $29.0 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2009 and 2007, we had fewer opportunities to use this mitigation methodology due to lower than acceptable security yields and related option pricing. We also mitigate our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivative contracts from time to time with counterparties. To the extent that the market value of any derivative contract moves to a negative market value, we are subject to loss if the counterparty defaults. In the future, there can be no assurance that such mitigation strategies will be available or successful. Our liquidity position may be negatively impacted if economic conditions continue to suffer. Liquidity is a measure of whether our cash flows and liquid assets are sufficient to satisfy current and future financial obligations, such as demand for loans, deposit withdrawals and operating costs. Our liquidity position is affected by a number of factors, including the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand, payment of interest and dividends on debt and equity instruments that we have issued, capital we inject into our bank subsidiaries, proceeds we raise through the issuance of securities, our ability to draw upon our revolving credit facility and dividends received from our banking subsidiaries. Our future liquidity position may be adversely affected by multiple factors, including:  if our banking subsidiaries report net losses or their earnings are weak relative to our cash flow needs;  if we deem it advisable or are required by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to make capital injections to our banking subsidiaries;  if we are unable to access our revolving credit facility due to a failure to satisfy financial and other covenants; or  if we are unable to raise additional capital on terms that are satisfactory to us. Continued weakness or worsening of the economy, real estate markets or unemployment levels may increase the likelihood that one or more of these events occurs. If our liquidity becomes limited, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 20 Table of Contents If we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios, we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets. As a banking institution, we are subject to regulations that require us to maintain certain capital ratios, such as the ratio of our Tier 1 capital to our risk-based assets. If our regulatory capital ratios decline, as a result of decreases in the value of our loan portfolio or otherwise, we will be required to improve such ratios by either raising additional capital or by disposing of assets. If we choose to dispose of assets, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so at prices that we believe to be appropriate, and our future operating results could be negatively affected. If we choose to raise additional capital, we may accomplish this by selling additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, which could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of holders of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase our capital costs and impair our ability to raise capital at any given time. Our agreements with the Treasury restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase common or preferred stock, place limitations on our executive compensation practices, and may result in dilution to our common stockholders. On December 19, 2008, we issued and sold preferred stock and a warrant to the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) as part of the Capital Purchase Program. The preferred stock has an annual dividend payment of 5.0%, which increases to 9.0% per year if we do not redeem the preferred stock at or prior to February 15, 2014. This higher dividend rate may be financially unattractive to us compared to the cost of capital under market conditions at that time. The warrant issued to Treasury entitles the holder to purchase 1,643,295 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $22.82 per share, and may be exercised, in whole or in part, over a ten-year period. If the warrant is exercised, the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock would be diluted. Furthermore, we are subject to certain restrictions as a result of our participation in the Capital Purchase Program. In particular, prior to December 19, 2011, unless we have redeemed all of the preferred stock or the Treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury will be required for us to, among other things, increase our common stock dividend or repurchase our common stock or other preferred stock (with certain exceptions, including the repurchase of common stock to offset share dilution from equity-based employee compensation awards). The terms of the Capital Purchase Program also place limitations on our executive compensation practices, which may have a negative impact on our ability to retain or attract well qualified and experienced senior officers. The inability to retain or attract well qualified senior officers could materially and adversely affect business, results of operations, financial condition, access to funding and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. We may also become subject to additional restrictions in the future, as the Treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law. Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future regarding the financial services industry may significantly increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner. As a result of the ongoing financial crisis and challenging market conditions and concerns regarding the consumer lending practices of certain institutions, we expect to face increased regulation and regulatory and political scrutiny of the financial services industry, including as a result of our participation in the Capital Purchase Program. We are already subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be substantial and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. While we are unable to predict the scope or impact of any potential legislation or regulatory action, bills that would result in significant changes to financial institutions have been introduced in Congress and it is possible that such legislation or implementing regulations could significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impact the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, require us to increase our regulatory capital, interfere with our executive compensation plans, or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner including our plan for de novo growth and growth through acquisitions. Our FDIC insurance premiums may increase, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Recent insured institution failures, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions, have significantly increased FDIC loss provisions, resulting in a decline of its deposit insurance fund to historical lows. The FDIC expects a higher rate of insured institution failures in the next few years compared to recent years; thus, the reserve ratio may continue to decline. In addition, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended, increased the limit on FDIC coverage to $250,000 through December 31, 2013. These developments have caused our FDIC insurance premiums to increase, and may cause additional increases. On September 30, 2009, the FDIC collected a special assessment from each insured institution, and additional assessments are possible. In addition, on November 12, 2009, the FDIC approved a final rule requiring that insured institutions prepay 21 Table of Contents 13 quarters estimated deposit insurance premiums. The banks made their prepayments on December 30, 2009. These prepaid premiums are recorded as a prepaid expense on our financial statements. The financial services industry is very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business could suffer. We face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services (including wealth management services) throughout our market area. Our competitors include national, regional and other community banks, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, factoring companies and other non-bank financial companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and market presence than Wintrust and, as a result of their size, may be able to offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and payment systems, and for banks that do not have a physical presence in our markets to compete for deposits. If we are unable to compete effectively, we will lose market share and income from deposits, loans, and other products may be reduced. This could adversely affect our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:  the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service and high ethical standards;  the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;  the ability to expand our market position;  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;  customer satisfaction with our level of service; and  industry and general economic trends. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our premium finance business may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our other lending operations, and could expose us to losses. We provide financing for the payment of commercial insurance premiums and life insurance premiums on a national basis through our wholly owned subsidiary, First Insurance Funding Corporation (FIFC). Commercial insurance premium finance loans involve a different, and possibly higher, risk of delinquency or collection than life insurance premium finance loans and the loan portfolios of our bank subsidiaries because these loans are issued primarily through relationships with a large number of unaffiliated insurance agents and because the borrowers are located nationwide. As a result, risk management and general supervisory oversight may be difficult. As of December 31, 2009, we had $730.1 million of commercial insurance premium finance loans outstanding, which represented 9% of our total loan portfolio as of such date. FIFC may also be more susceptible to third party fraud with respect to commercial insurance premium finance loans because these loans are originated and many times funded through relationships with unaffiliated insurance agents and brokers. Acts of fraud are difficult to detect and deter, and we cannot assure investors that FIFCs risk management procedures and controls will prevent losses from fraudulent activity. We may be exposed to the risk of loss in its premium finance business because of fraud, the possibility of insolvency of insurance carriers that are in possession of unearned insurance premiums that represent our collateral or that our collateral value is not ultimately enough to cover our outstanding balance in the event that a borrower defaults, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, to the extent that affiliates of insurance carriers, banks, and other lending institutions add greater service and flexibility to their financing practices in the future, our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that FIFC will be able to continue to compete successfully in its markets. 22 Table of Contents If we fail to comply with certain of our covenants under our securitization facility, the holders of the related notes could declare a rapid amortization event, which could require us to repay any outstanding amounts immediately, which would significantly impair our financial condition and liquidity. In September 2009, our indirect subsidiary, FIFC Premium Funding I, LLC, sold $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its Series 2009-A Premium Finance Asset Backed Notes, Class A (the Notes), which were issued in a securitization transaction sponsored by FIFC. The related indenture contains certain financial and other covenants that must be met in order to continue to sell notes into the facility. In addition, if any of these covenants are breached, the holders of the Notes may, under certain circumstances, declare a rapid amortization event, which would require us to repay any outstanding notes immediately. Such an event would significantly impair our financial condition and liquidity. Widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of FIFC. FIFCs premium finance loans are primarily secured by the insurance policies financed by the loans. These insurance policies are written by a large number of insurance companies geographically dispersed throughout the country. To the extent that commercial or life insurance providers experience widespread difficulties or credit downgrades, the value of our collateral will be reduced. If one or more large nationwide insurers were to fail, the value of our portfolio could be significantly negatively impacted. A significant downgrade in the value of the collateral supporting our premium finance business could impair our ability to create liquidity for this business, which, in turn could negatively impact our ability to expand. An actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength may cause others to reduce or cease doing business with us, which could result in a decrease in our net interest income. Our customers rely upon our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, including due to market or regulatory developments, announced or rumored business developments or results of operations, or a decline in stock price, customers may withdraw their deposits or otherwise seek services from other banking institutions and prospective customers may select other service providers. The risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is increased in the current market environment, where the consolidation of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, is resulting in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors. If customers reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services that we provide them, net interest income and fee revenues will decrease accordingly, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, our ability to provide high quality service will be diminished and our results of operations may suffer. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our senior management and other key personnel. Our business model is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality, personal service at our community banks. In addition, as a holding company that conducts its operations through our subsidiaries, we are focused on providing entrepreneurial-based compensation to the chief executives of each our business units. As a Company with start-up and growth oriented operations, we are cognizant that to attract and retain the managerial talent necessary to operate and grow our businesses we often have to compensate our executives with a view to the business we expect them to manage, rather than the size of the business they currently manage. Accordingly, the restrictions placed on executive compensation through our participation in the Capital Purchase Program, as well any future restrictions, may negatively impact our ability to retain and attract senior management. The loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel, or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 23 Table of Contents If we are unable to continue to identify favorable acquisitions or successfully integrate our acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our results of operations could suffer. In the past several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions of banks, other financial service related companies and financial service related assets and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Wintrust seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in Wintrust achieving slower growth. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:  potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities or asset quality issues of the target company;  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;  potential disruption to our business, including diversion of our managements time and attention;  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;  difficulty in estimating the value of the target company; and  potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Wintrusts tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may face competition from other financial institutions with respect to proposed FDIC-assisted transactions. We may participate in FDIC-assisted acquisitions, which could present additional risks to our financial condition. We may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of troubled financial institutions in transactions facilitated by the FDIC. In addition to the risks frequently associated with acquisitions, an acquisition of a troubled financial institution may involve a greater risk that the acquired assets underperform compared to our expectations. Because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition, including preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks including, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems. Additionally, while the FDIC may agree to assume certain losses in transactions that it facilitates, there can be no assurances that we would not be required to raise additional capital as a condition to, or as a result of, participation in an FDIC-assisted transaction. Any such transactions and related issuances of stock may have dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership. De novo operations and branch openings often involve significant expenses and delayed returns and may negatively impact Wintrusts profitability. Our financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by our strategy of de novo bank formations and branch openings. While the recent financial crisis and interest rate environment has caused us to open fewer de novo banks, we expect to undertake additional de novo bank formations or branch openings when market conditions improve. Based on our experience, we believe that it generally takes over 13 months for de novo banks to first achieve operational profitability, depending on the number of banking facilities opened, the impact of organizational and overhead expenses, the start-up phase of generating deposits and the time lag typically involved in redeploying deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. However, it may take longer than expected or than the amount of time Wintrust has historically experienced for new banks and/or banking facilities to reach profitability, and there can be no guarantee that these new banks or branches will ever be profitable. Moreover, the FDICs recent issuance extending the enhanced supervisory period for de novo banks from three to seven years, including higher capital requirements during this period, could also delay a new banks ability to contribute to the Companys earnings and impact the Companys willingness to expand through de novo bank formation. To the extent we undertake additional de novo bank, branch and business formations, our level of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets will be impacted by start-up costs associated with such operations, and it is likely to continue to experience the effects of higher expenses relative to operating income from the new operations. These expenses may be higher than we expected or than our experience has shown, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 24 Table of Contents Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards could materially adversely affect how we report our financial results and condition. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws and Illinois law may have the effect of impeding the acquisition of control of Wintrust by means of a tender offer, a proxy fight, open-market purchases or otherwise in a transaction not approved by our board of directors. For example, our board of directors may issue additional authorized shares of our capital stock to deter future attempts to gain control of Wintrust, including the authority to determine the terms of any one or more series of preferred stock, such as voting rights, conversion rates and liquidation preferences. As a result of the ability to fix voting rights for a series of preferred stock, the board has the power, to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duty, to issue a series of preferred stock to persons friendly to management in order to attempt to block a merger or other transaction by which a third party seeks control, and thereby assist the incumbent board of directors and management to retain their respective positions. In addition, our articles of incorporation expressly elect to be governed by the provisions of Section 7.85 of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors. The ability of a third party to acquire us is also limited under applicable banking regulations. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 requires any bank holding company (as defined in that Act) to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Any person other than a bank holding company is required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire 10% or more of our outstanding common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978. Any holder of 25% or more of our outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging a future takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but which our individual shareholders may deem to be in their best interests or in which our shareholders may receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices. As a result, shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. Such provisions will also render the removal of our current board of directors or management more difficult. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
