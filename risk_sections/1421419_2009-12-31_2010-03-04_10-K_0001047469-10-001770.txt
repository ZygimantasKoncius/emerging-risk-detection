ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Risks Related to Our Business If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. Any such failure may adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, to implement our business strategy we need to, among other things, develop and introduce new products, find new applications for our existing products, obtain regulatory approval for such new products and applications and educate physicians about the clinical and cost benefits of our products and thereby increase the number of hospitals and physicians that use our products. In addition, we are seeking to increase our international sales and will need to increase our worldwide direct sales force and enter into distribution agreements with third parties in order to do so, all of which may also result in additional or different foreign regulatory requirements, with which we may not be able to comply. Moreover, even if we successfully implement our business strategy, our operating results may not improve. We may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt different strategies due to business or competitive factors. The market opportunities that we expect to develop for our products may not be as large as we expect or may not develop at all. The growth of our business is dependent, in large part, upon the development of market opportunities for our new products, product enhancements and new applications for our existing products. The market opportunities that we expect to exist for our devices may not develop as expected, or at all. For example, clinical studies have shown linkages between the existence of PFOs and certain types of stroke and migraines. If the connection between PFO closure and the prevention or reduction of the occurrence of stroke and migraines is not as strong as we anticipate, the market opportunity for our AMPLATZER PFO Occluders will not develop as expected, if at all. Moreover, even if the market opportunities develop as expected, new technologies and products introduced by our competitors may significantly limit our ability to capitalize on any such market opportunity. Our failure to capitalize on our expected market opportunities would adversely effect our growth. Our AMPLATZER Septal Occluders generate a large portion of our net sales. If sales of this family of products were to decline, our net sales and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our lead family of products, the AMPLATZER Septal Occluders, represented 54.1% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and we anticipate that this family of products will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the next few years. If sales of AMPLATZER Septal Occluders were to decline in any of our key markets because of decreased demand, adverse regulatory actions, patent infringement claims, failure to protect our intellectual property, manufacturing problems or delays, pricing pressures, competitive factors or any other reason, 32 Table of Contents our net sales would decrease, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements or find new applications for our existing products, we will not remain competitive. Our future success and our ability to increase net sales and earnings depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market new products, product enhancements and new applications for our existing products. However, we may not be able to, among other things: successfully develop or market new products or enhance existing products; find new applications for our existing products; manufacture, market and distribute such products in a cost-effective manner; or obtain required regulatory clearances and approvals. Our failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our new or enhanced products contain undetected errors or design defects or if new applications that we develop for existing products do not work as planned, our ability to market these products could be substantially impeded, resulting in lost net sales, potential damage to our reputation and delays in obtaining market acceptance of these products. We cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully develop and market new or enhanced products or new applications for our existing products. We make our regulatory status forecasts, including determining expected dates of filings with, or submissions to, relevant authorities, based on the information currently available to us. The actual timing for any of these regulatory steps may vary, and we may revise any such forecasts as new information becomes available. Moreover, most new or enhanced products or new applications for our existing products require that their safety and efficacy be proven by clinical trials before they receive regulatory approval. Our clinical trials may not prove the safety and efficacy of our products, and in such circumstances our products would not receive regulatory approval. In addition, these clinical trials typically last several years, and during that time competing products, procedures or therapies may be introduced that are less expensive and/or more effective than our products and thus render our products obsolete. If we do not continue to expand our product portfolio on a timely basis or if those products and applications do not receive regulatory and market acceptance or become obsolete, we will not grow our business as we currently expect. If we fail to educate and train physicians as to the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products, our sales will not grow. Acceptance of our products depends, in large part, on our ability to (1) educate the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to alternative products, procedures and therapies and (2) train physicians in the proper use and implementation of our devices. Certain of the structural heart defects and vascular diseases that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by surgery, drugs or other medical devices, some of which have a longer history of use and are more widely used by the medical community. Physicians may be reluctant to change their medical treatment practices for a number of reasons, including: lack of experience with new products; lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits; 33 Table of Contents perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures; lack of availability of adequate reimbursement within healthcare payment systems; and costs associated with the purchase of new products and equipment. Convincing physicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary to properly train to use new devices is challenging, and we may not be successful in these efforts. If physicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. Such misuse or ineffective use may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us. Accordingly, even if our devices are superior to alternative treatments, our success will depend on our ability to gain and maintain market acceptance for our devices. If we fail to do so, our sales will not grow and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. The expansion of our product portfolio is dependent upon the success of our clinical trials and receipt of regulatory approvals. If these trials are not completed on schedule or are unsuccessful, or if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for our product pipeline, we will not be able to market the related products. A number of our products are in the early stages of development. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new application of, claim for, or significant modification to, an existing device, we must first receive either approval of a PMA application from the FDA or clearance under section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. Clinical trials are always required to support a PMA application approval and may be required to support a 510(k) clearance. Currently, we have four studies underway designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our AMPLATZER PFO Occluder to treat migraine or recurrent stroke, as applicable, in patients with PFOs, as well as a number of post-approval studies. Our current or future clinical trials contemplated in support of our PMA or 510(k) applications may not commence or conclude in a timely fashion, or at all, or may not produce the desired results. For example, several of our products under development do not yet have agreed-upon protocols or approved Investigational Device Exemptions, or IDEs. Agreeing on clinical trial designs and protocols may be time consuming and requires interaction with and advance approval from regulatory authorities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to agree on appropriate trial designs and protocols with the FDA and thus commence clinical trials or, if commenced, that our PMA applications will be approved or our 510(k) clearances will be granted, in a timely fashion or at all. If our trials for any reason do not commence, do not produce the intended results or are delayed or halted due to the occurrence of adverse events, or if we do not otherwise obtain FDA or other regulatory agency approval with respect to our products in a timely fashion, our future growth may be significantly hampered. Our failure to comply with the regulations relating to the PMA approval and 510(k) clearance processes could also lead to the issuance of warning letters, injunctions, consent decrees, manufacturing suspensions, loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, and termination of distribution arrangements or product seizures. In the most egregious cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities could be imposed. Moreover, sales of our products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Because a significant portion of our product sales are made in international markets, any failure to comply with directives and regulatory requirements imposed in foreign jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we continually evaluate the potential financial benefits and costs of our clinical trials and the products being evaluated in them. If we determine that the costs associated with attaining regulatory approval of a product exceed the potential financial benefits of that product or if the projected development timeline is inconsistent with our investment strategy, we may choose to stop a clinical trial or the development of a particular product, enhancement or application, which could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business and could result in a charge to our earnings. 34 Table of Contents We depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and on other third-party contract research organizations to manage our clinical trials and to perform related data collection and analysis, and as a result, we may face significant costs and delays that are outside of our control. We rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third-party contract research organizations to manage our clinical trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. Our agreements with clinical investigators, clinical sites and other third parties for clinical testing place substantial responsibilities on these parties. If clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or the FDA's good clinical practice regulations, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, we may face significant costs and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for, or successfully commercialize, new products, enhancements or applications, in a timely manner, or at all. We also compete with other manufacturers of medical devices for investigators and clinical sites to conduct clinical trials. If we are unable to identify investigators and clinical sites on a timely and cost-effective basis, our ability to conduct trials of our products and, therefore, our ability to obtain required regulatory approval or clearance would be adversely affected. We may be subject to compliance action, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. Our products are currently approved for the treatment of certain structural heart defects and vascular diseases. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products in the United States for approved uses. Physicians may use our products for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, even though we do not promote our products for such off-label uses. If the FDA, however, determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of warning letters, injunctions, consent decrees, seizures, civil fines or criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might also take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties from other statutory authorities. We operate in a very competitive environment. The medical device industry is characterized by strong competition. We have several competitors, including Boston Scientific Corporation, NMT Medical, Inc., W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., St. Jude Medical Inc., Cook, Inc., Occlutech GmbH, Cardia, Inc. and Atritech, Inc. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have more established reputations with our target customers, as well as global distribution channels that may be more effective than ours. Our competitors may develop and offer technologies and products that are safer or more effective, have better features, are easier to use, less expensive or more readily accepted by the marketplace than ours. Their products could make our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may also be able to achieve more efficient manufacturing and distribution operations than we may be able to and may offer lower prices than we could offer profitably. We may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business and may adopt different strategies due to business or competitive factors or factors currently unforeseen, such as the introduction by our competitors of new products or new medical technologies that would make our products obsolete or uncompetitive. 35 Table of Contents In addition, consolidation in the medical device industry could make the competitive environment more difficult. The industry has recently experienced some consolidation, and there is a risk that larger companies will enter our markets. We depend on third-party distributors to market and sell our products internationally in a number of markets. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by both our distributors' performance and our ability to maintain these relationships on terms that are favorable to us. We depend, in part, on third-party distributors to sell our medical devices outside the United States. In 2009, our net sales through third-party distributors was 19.3% of our total net sales. Our international distributors operate independently of us, and we have limited control over their operations, which exposes us to significant risks. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products and may also market and sell competitive products. In addition, our distributors may not comply with the laws and regulatory requirements in their local jurisdictions, which may limit their ability to market or sell our products. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to locate competent distributors in particular countries and secure their services on favorable terms, or at all, we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of net sales in these markets or enter new markets, and we may not realize our expected international growth. The terms and effects of our Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice relating to potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. On June 2, 2008, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, or the DPA, with the Department of Justice concerning alleged improper payments that were made by our former independent distributor in China to (1) physicians in Chinese public hospitals in connection with the sale of our products and (2) an official in the Chinese patent office in connection with the approval of our patent applications, in each case, in potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA. The FCPA makes it unlawful for, among other persons, a U.S. company, acting directly or through an agent, to offer or to make improper payments to any "foreign official" in order to obtain or retain business or to induce such "foreign official" to use his or her influence with a foreign government or instrumentality thereof for such purpose. As part of the DPA, we consented to the Department of Justice filing a two-count criminal statement of information against us in the U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, which was filed on June 3, 2008. The two counts include a conspiracy to violate the FCPA and a substantive violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA related to the above-described activities in China. Although we did not plead guilty to that information, we accepted responsibility for the acts of our employees and agents as set forth in the DPA, and we face prosecution under that information, and possibly other charges as well, if we fail to comply with the terms of the DPA. Those terms require us to, for approximately three years, (1) continue to cooperate fully with the Department of Justice on any investigation relating to violations of the FCPA and any and all other matters relating to improper payments, (2) continue to implement a compliance and ethics program designed to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, (3) review existing, and if necessary, adopt new controls, policies and procedures designed to ensure that we make and keep fair and accurate books, records and accounts and maintain a rigorous anti-corruption compliance code designed to detect and deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and (4) retain and pay for an independent monitor to assess and oversee our compliance and ethics program with respect to the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. The DPA also required us to pay a monetary penalty of $2.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we had recorded a financial charge of $2.0 million for this expected settlement, which was paid in June 2008. The terms of the DPA will remain binding on any successor or merger partner as long as the agreement is in effect. 36 Table of Contents The effects that compliance with any of the terms of the DPA will have on us are unknown and they may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The activities of the government-approved independent monitor, as well as the continued implementation of a compliance and ethics program and the adoption of internal controls, policies and procedures to detect and prevent future violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, may result in increased costs to us and change the way in which we operate, the outcome of which we are unable to predict. For example, implementing and monitoring such compliance procedures in the large number of foreign jurisdictions where we operate can be expensive and time-consuming. As a result of our remediation measures, we may also encounter difficulties conducting business in certain foreign countries and retaining and attracting additional business with certain customers, and we cannot predict the extent of these difficulties. In addition, entering into the DPA in the United States may adversely affect our operations or result in legal claims against us, which may include claims of special, indirect, derivative or consequential damages. Our failure to comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice would have a negative impact on our ongoing operations. As described above, we are subject to a three-year DPA with the Department of Justice. If we comply with the DPA, the Department of Justice has agreed not to prosecute us with respect to the above-described activities in China and, following the term of the DPA, to permanently dismiss the criminal statement of information that is currently pending against us. Accordingly, the DPA could be substantially nullified, and we could be subject to severe sanctions and resumed civil and criminal prosecution, as well as severe fines, penalties and other regulatory sanctions, in the event of any additional violation of the FCPA or any other applicable anti-corruption laws by us or any of our officers, other employees or agents in any jurisdiction or of our failure to otherwise meet any of the terms of the DPA as determined by the Department of Justice in its sole discretion. The claims alleged in the DPA with the Department of Justice only relate to our actions in China as outlined above, and do not relate to any future violations or the discovery of past violations not expressly covered by the DPA. Any breach of the terms of the DPA would also cause damage to our business and reputation, as well as impair investor confidence in our company and result in adverse consequences on our ability to obtain or continue financing for current or future projects. In addition, although we are not currently restricted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General, from participating in federal healthcare programs, any criminal conviction of our company under the FCPA in the future would result in our mandatory exclusion from such programs, and it may lead to debarment from U.S. and foreign government contracts. Any such exclusion or debarment would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to comply with the terms of the DPA is dependent, among other things, on the success of our ongoing compliance and ethics program, including our ability to continue to manage our distributors and agents and supervise, train and retain competent employees, as well as the efforts of our employees to adhere to our compliance and ethics program and the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. It is possible that, despite our best efforts, additional FCPA issues, or issues under anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions, could arise in the future. Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance and ethics procedures, to ensure that our officers, other employees and agents comply with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate or to otherwise comply with any term of the DPA would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 37 Table of Contents Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. Our foreign operations expose us to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks. Approximately 44.8% of our net sales for 2009 were in foreign currencies. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations have been, and will continue to be, subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Although we have benefited from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the past, we may not benefit from the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future, which may adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. During a period in which the U.S. dollar appreciates against a given foreign currency, our consolidated net sales will be lower than they might otherwise have been because net sales earned in such foreign currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. At present, based on a foreign exchange rate exposure management policy initiated in the first quarter of 2009, we have started to engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. As we grow our international direct sales, we expect our foreign currency-denominated net sales will increase, which would increase our risks related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We cannot assure you that our monitoring of our net foreign currency exchange rate exposure, our foreign currency exchange rate exposure management policy or any foreign currency hedging activity that we implement will be effective or otherwise adequately protect us against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose members of our senior management team or scientific personnel. We depend on the continued service of key managerial, scientific and technical personnel, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We compete for such personnel with other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. Any loss or interruption of the services of our key personnel could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives, because we may be unable to find an appropriate replacement, if necessary. For example, Dr. Amplatz plays a key role in the early stages of our research and development programs, which are crucial to expanding our product portfolio. We have a five-year research and development contract with Dr. Amplatz that expires in December 2010, and we may not be able to renew it. The loss of Dr. Amplatz's services may negatively affect our ability to expand our product portfolio beyond our current pipeline. In addition, after termination of our contract with Dr. Amplatz, he is not allowed to compete with our company for 18 months in the United States. Any competition from Dr. Amplatz after that period or outside the United States may negatively affect our business. Healthcare legislative or administrative changes resulting in restrictive third-party payor reimbursement practices or preferences for alternate treatment may decrease the demand for, or put downward pressure on the price of, our products. Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, which typically receive reimbursement from various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from government and third-party payors is critical to our success. The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products. After we develop a promising new product, we may experience limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Major third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs. The introduction of cost-containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased 38 Table of Contents discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed. Initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are also underway in several countries in which we do business. Implementation of new legislative and administrative changes in the United States and in overseas markets, such as Germany and Japan, may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products and, as a result, may adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products. Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower-cost products or other treatments for our products. Further legislative or administrative changes to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems that significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for such procedures, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of such systems in coverage or reimbursement issues, would have an adverse impact on the number of products purchased by our customers and the prices our customers are willing to pay for them. This, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may be adversely affected if consolidation in the healthcare industry leads to demand for price concessions or if we are excluded from being a supplier by a group purchasing organization or similar entity. Because healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms have been launched by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs. As a result, there has been a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including hospitals, with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense. This has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important markets as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions. If a group purchasing organization excludes us from being one of their suppliers, our net sales will be adversely impacted. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products. We conduct substantially all of our operations at our corporate headquarters, and any fire, explosion, violent weather conditions or other unanticipated events affecting our corporate headquarters could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct all of our manufacturing and research and development activities, as well as most of our sales, warehousing and administrative activities, at our corporate headquarters in Plymouth, Minnesota. Our corporate headquarters is subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. This facility and the manufacturing equipment that we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace or repair and could require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, if we were unable to utilize our existing manufacturing facility, the use of any new facility would need to be approved by the FDA, which would result in significant production delays. We may also in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of regulatory issues, equipment failure or delays in deliveries. Any disruption or other unanticipated events affecting our corporate headquarters and therefore our sales, manufacturing, warehousing, research and development and administrative activities would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently carry $60.0 million of insurance coverage for damage to our property and the disruption of our business. Such insurance coverage, however, may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 39 Table of Contents We rely on a single supplier for nitinol, the key raw material in all of our products, which makes us susceptible to supply shortages of this material. We rely on a single supplier for nitinol, the key raw material in all of our products, and have no written agreement with this supplier. If we are unable to obtain nitinol from this supplier, we may be unable to obtain nitinol through other sources, on acceptable terms, within a reasonable amount of time or at all. Further, even if we are able to find an alternative source for nitinol, we may not be able to prevent an interruption of production of our products. Our business would be adversely affected if such interruption was prolonged. For example, if a raw material or component is a critical element, an element that can have a significant effect on performance and safety of the related device, such as nitinol with respect to our devices, FDA and foreign regulations may require additional testing and prior approval of such raw material or component from new suppliers prior to our use of these materials or components. As a result, if we need to establish additional or replacement suppliers for nitinol or any other critical component, our access to these components may be delayed while we qualify such suppliers and obtain any necessary FDA and foreign regulatory approvals. Any disruption in the ongoing shipment of nitinol could interrupt production of our products, which could result in a decrease of our net sales, or could cause an increase in our cost of sales if we have to pay another supplier a higher price for nitinol. Any failure of our management information systems could harm our business and results of operations. Our business's rapid growth may continue to place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. We depend on our recently implemented management information systems to actively manage our controlled regulatory and manufacturing documents. We also depend on our enterprise resource planning system to actively manage our invoicing, production and inventory planning, clinical trial information and quality compliance. We must continually assess the necessity for any upgrades to our information systems. The inability of our management information systems to operate as we anticipate could damage our reputation with our customers, disrupt our business or result in, among other things, decreased net sales and increased overhead costs. As a result, any such failure could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Being a public company has substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Until the fourth quarter of 2009, we operated our business as a private company. As a publicly-traded company, we are subject to rules and regulations that increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more time-consuming and costly, and divert our management's attention away from the operation of our business. We are obligated to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, all of which impose significant compliance and reporting obligations upon us. We may not be successful in complying with these obligations, and compliance with these obligations could be time consuming and expensive. Failure to comply with the additional reporting and corporate governance requirements could lead to fines imposed on us, suspension or delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market, deregistration under the Exchange Act and, in the most egregious cases, criminal sanctions could be imposed. We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We may require significant additional debt and equity financing in order to implement our business strategy. In particular, our capital requirements depend on many factors, including the amount of 40 Table of Contents expenditures on research and development and intellectual property, the number of clinical trials that we conduct, new product development and the cash required to service our debt. To the extent that our existing or future capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth, reduce our costs or sell certain of our assets. For example, we raised additional capital from affiliates of Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe IX, L.P., or Welsh Carson, to finance the acquisition of the assets of our Italian distributor. We cannot assure you that such investors will agree to provide us with additional financing in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital will likely depend on, among others, our performance, our prospects, our level of indebtedness and market conditions. Any additional equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. The recent global economic crisis and related tightening of credit markets has made it more difficult and more expensive to raise additional capital. If we are unable to access additional capital on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy, which may limit the future growth and development of our business. In addition, equity financings could result in dilution to our stockholders, and equity or debt securities issued in future financings may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital. Product liability claims and uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. The manufacturing and marketing of medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims. Our product development and production processes are extremely complex and could expose our products to defects. Any defects could harm our credibility, lead to product liability claims and litigation and decrease our products' market acceptance. Our current product liability policies provide $35.0 million of insurance coverage, with a $250,000 deductible per occurrence for new claims. We cannot assure you that such insurance will be available or adequate to satisfy future claims or that our insurers will be able to pay claims on insurance policies which they have issued to us. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. In the event that we are held liable for a claim or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, that claim could materially damage our reputation and business. We currently have no outstanding products liability claims. However, defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, could be costly, could divert management attention and might result in adverse publicity, and for these reasons, any product liability claims could result in significant costs and harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not successfully make or integrate acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances. We may pursue selected acquisitions and strategic alliances. We compete with other medical device companies for these opportunities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect acquisitions or strategic alliances on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we enter into these transactions, we may experience the following, among other things: difficulties in integrating any acquired companies and products into our existing business; inability to realize the benefits we anticipate in a timely fashion, or at all; attrition of key personnel from acquired businesses; significant costs, charges or writedowns; or 41 Table of Contents unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations. Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions which would dilute our existing stockholders. Risks Related to Regulation If we fail to comply with the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state and foreign laws, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs. A provision of the U.S. Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations. In addition, most of the states in which our products are sold in the United States have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these laws are even broader than the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute in that their prohibitions are not limited to items or services paid for by a federal healthcare program but, instead, apply regardless of the source of payment. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or such similar state laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs. We derive a significant portion of our net sales from international operations, and many foreign governments have equivalent statutes with similar penalties. All of our financial relationships with healthcare providers and others who provide products or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries are potentially governed by the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state or foreign laws. We believe our operations are in material compliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state or foreign laws. However, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws, which could be time-consuming and costly to us, could divert management's attention from operating our business and could prevent healthcare providers from purchasing our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if our arrangements were found to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state or foreign laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The possibility of non-compliance with manufacturing regulations raises uncertainties with respect to our ability to manufacture our products. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities. The FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards, including, but not limited to, Quality System Regulations, Good Manufacturing Practices and International Standards Organization, or ISO, standards. These federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities may conduct periodic audits of our facilities or our processes to monitor our compliance with applicable regulatory standards. If a regulatory authority finds that we fail to comply with the appropriate regulatory standards, it may require product validation, new processes and procedures or shutdown of our manufacturing operations. It may impose fines on us or delay or withdraw clearances or other regulatory approvals. If 42 Table of Contents a regulatory authority determines that our non-compliance is severe, it may impose other penalties including limiting our ability to secure approvals for new devices and accessories. In addition, many of the improvements we make to our manufacturing process must first be approved by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities. Our failure to obtain the necessary approvals may limit our ability to improve the way in which we manufacture our products. Our business will be harmed if we fail to obtain necessary clearances or approvals to market our medical devices. Our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities. Similar regulatory review and approval processes also exist in foreign countries in which our products are marketed. These regulations relate to product design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution, import, export and shipping. Before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product in the United States, we must first receive either PMA approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA unless an exemption applies. The PMA approval process, commonly used for riskier devices such as those which support or sustain life or are used invasively in the body, requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device based, in part, on data obtained in clinical trials. The PMA approval process and clinical trials can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant user fees. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that the proposed device is "substantially equivalent" to a device legally on the market, known as a "predicate" device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and efficacy, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA approval pathway is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. It generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the PMA is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. The 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take longer. In many of the foreign regions in which we market our products, such as Europe, we are subject to regulations substantially similar to those of the FDA, although these foreign regulatory requirements may vary widely from country to country. In Europe, only medical devices which bear a CE Mark may be marketed. Japan has a regulatory process that generally accepts clinical data from either the United States or Europe supplemented by a small study in Japan to establish experience and confirm safety. In addition, as we selectively convert into direct sales forces in foreign regions, we will be subject to additional regulations in these markets. Any failure to receive desired marketing clearances or approvals from the FDA or other federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities may adversely affect our ability to market our products and may have a significant adverse effect on our overall business. Moreover, the value of existing clearances or approvals can be eroded if safety or efficacy problems develop. We may fail to comply with continuing post-market regulatory requirements of the FDA and other federal, state or foreign authorities and become subject to substantial penalties, or our products may subsequently prove to be unsafe, forcing us to recall or withdraw such products from the market. Even after product clearance or approval, we and our contract manufacturers must comply with continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal, state or foreign authorities, including the FDA's Quality System Regulation requirements, which obligate manufacturers, including third-party contract manufacturers, to adhere to stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the design and manufacture of a device. We are also subject to medical device reporting regulations in the United States and abroad. For example, we are required to report to 43 Table of Contents the FDA if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We must report corrections and removals to the FDA where the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health, and we must maintain records of other corrections or removals. The FDA closely regulates promotion and advertising, and our promotional and advertising activities may come under scrutiny. If any medical device reports we file with the FDA regarding death, serious injuries or malfunctions indicate or suggest that one of our products presents an unacceptable risk to patients, including when used off-label by physicians, we may be forced to recall our product or withdraw it from the market. We have had several product recalls in the past. For example, in October 2006, we recalled catheter and delivery systems after internal testing revealed the potential for a tear to develop in the packaging under extreme shipping conditions. We immediately modified our shipping method and subsequently received approval from the FDA and our Notified Body in Europe to modify the packaging to prevent tears from developing. Approximately 15,871 devices were returned and replaced by us. On February 28, 2007, we submitted a letter to the FDA formally requesting the recall to be closed, and on October 9, 2008 the FDA confirmed that the recall has been completed. During the third quarter of 2005, we voluntarily recalled 80 of our AMPLATZER Vascular Plug devices over concerns that our operators failed to follow internal sterilization procedures. Of the 80 devices, only two had left our possession. After testing the recalled products, none of them were found to be non-sterile. We submitted a letter to the FDA formally requesting closure of the recall, and the recall has been closed. In September 2005, we recalled our AMPLATZER Duct Occluder device after discovering through in-process testing during manufacturing that the device had the potential to rub against the catheter during the implant procedure. Approximately 2,800 devices were recalled, 92% of which had left our possession. We made the required changes to our AMPLATZER Duct Occluder, and these changes have been approved both internationally and by the FDA. We submitted letters to the FDA formally requesting closure of the recall, and the recall has been closed. Finally, on December 8, 2004, we initiated a voluntary recall of all catheters and delivery systems in the field because of non-toxic contaminated tubing produced by one of our suppliers. We received several toxicology tests that confirmed the level of contamination was negligible and posed no threat to patients. We submitted letters to the FDA formally requesting closure of the recall, and the recall has been closed. We are currently conducting two post-approval studies that were required as a condition of approval by the FDA of the AMPLATZER Septal Occluder and the AMPLATZER Muscular VSD Occluder. The studies are designed to monitor, for a period of up to five years after the procedure, patients treated with a device in the clinical studies that supported approval of the product. The objective is to collect and report to the FDA additional data on the long-term safety and efficacy of the device. The majority of patients enrolled in these two studies were children at the time of receiving their implants. In some cases, it has been challenging to follow these patients for up to five years as they and their families move or otherwise stop seeing the physician who performed the treatment. Any failure to comply with continuing regulation by the FDA or other federal, state or foreign authorities could result in enforcement action that may include regulatory letters requesting compliance action, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals, product recall, modification or termination of product marketing, entering into a consent decree, seizure and detention of products, paying significant fines and penalties, criminal prosecution and similar actions that could limit product sales, delay product shipment and harm our profitability. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 44 Table of Contents Modifications to our products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances or may require us to recall or cease marketing our modified products until approvals or clearances are obtained. Modifications to our products may require new approvals or clearances in the United States and abroad, such as PMA approvals or 510(k) clearances in the United States and CE Marks in Europe. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. A manufacturer may determine that a modification does not significantly affect safety or efficacy or does not represent a major change in its intended use, so that no new U.S. or foreign approval or clearance is necessary. We have made modifications that we determined do not require approval or clearance. However, the FDA and foreign authorities can review a manufacturer's decision, including any of our decisions, and may disagree. If the FDA or other foreign authority disagrees and requires new approvals or clearances for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing our products as modified, which could require us to redesign our products and harm our operating results. In these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant enforcement actions. If we determine that a modification to an FDA-approved or cleared device could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, then we must obtain a new PMA or PMA supplement approval or 510(k) clearance. Where we determine that modifications to our products require a new PMA or PMA supplemental approval or 510(k) clearance, we may not be able to obtain those additional approvals or clearances for the modifications or additional indications in a timely manner, or at all. For those products sold in Europe, we must notify AMTAC, our European Union Notified Body, if significant changes are made to the products or if there are substantial changes to our quality assurance systems affecting those products. Delays in obtaining required future approvals or clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation We have been and may in the future become subject to claims that our products violate the patent or intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and disruptive to us. We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant patent litigation, and in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device industry to aggressively challenge the rights of other companies to prevent the marketing of new or existing devices. As a result, we or our products may become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation or interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or the foreign equivalents thereto to determine the priority of claims to inventions. The defense of intellectual property suits, USPTO interference proceedings or the foreign equivalents thereto, as well as related legal and administrative proceedings, are both costly and time consuming and may divert management's attention from other business concerns. An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could, among other things: subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, including treble damages; require disputed rights to be licensed from a third party for royalties that may be substantial; require us to cease using such technology; or prohibit us from selling certain of our products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 45 Table of Contents On March 28, 2006, we settled a patent infringement suit with NMT Medical, Inc. in which we paid NMT Medical and a second patent holder a $30.0 million one-time payment. As part of the settlement, we received a fully paid, royalty-free license for the related patents. In addition, we may have disputes with our licensors regarding the scope of their patents. We make royalty payments with respect to certain patents that were assigned to us by Mr. Curtis Amplatz. In 2008, Mr. Curtis Amplatz inquired regarding the scope of the royalty agreements we had with him and whether they applied to additional products of ours. In response, we had discussions in which we clarified the scope of the agreements and our payments under the agreements. We believe the inquiry of Mr. Curtis Amplatz to be concluded. However, any dispute relating to the products included in a portfolio subject to a royalty agreement or license could result in us being subject to additional royalty payments, although we do not believe any such dispute to limit our right to sell or market any of our devices. We are currently subject to claims by Medtronic that substantially all of our occluder and vascular plug products infringe certain of Medtronic's patents. If we are not successful in our defense of these claims or in our counterclaims, we may be subject to damages, ongoing royalties and other remedies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In January 2007, Medtronic, Inc. filed a patent infringement action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that substantially all of our AMPLATZER occluder and vascular plug devices, which have historically accounted for substantially all of our net sales, infringe three of Medtronic's method and apparatus patents on shape memory alloy stents (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,190,546, 6,306,141 and 5,067,957). Medtronic is seeking compensatory damages with respect to our products manufactured or sold in the United States. Medtronic asserted but later withdrew its requests for injunctive relief and for damages based on willfulness. We have asserted defenses and counterclaims for non-infringement and challenged the validity and enforceability of Medtronic's patents. On April 28, 2009, the court granted summary judgment in our favor finding that we do not infringe Medtronic's '546 patent. Subsequently, Medtronic withdrew certain allegations with respect to the remaining two patents. The trial on the remaining issues in the case was divided into a jury trial phase and non-jury, bench trial phase. On August 5, 2009, the jury returned a verdict that the subject AMPLATZER occluder and vascular plug products infringed the claims at issue with respect to both of the two remaining Medtronic patents and that the Medtronic patent claims at issue had not been proven by us to be invalid. The jury verdict awarded Medtronic damages of $57.8 million representing 11% of historical sales of the occluder and vascular plug products in question during the timeframe specified for each patent. The verdict is not enforceable until the completion of the trial and entry of a final, non-appealable judgment. Following the jury verdict, the court held the non-jury phase of the trial in early December 2009 to hear, our claim that the '141 patent is invalid based on the doctrine of double patenting, which prohibits obtaining two patents covering the same basic invention in a continuation application . Upon conclusion of the non-jury phase of the trial, the court will consider post-trial motions and enter a judgment, which we expect will take place in mid to late 2010. Additional detail regarding this litigation can be found elsewhere in this Form 10-K in Item 3 legal Proceedings under the subheading "Medtronic Litigation in the United States." If we do not receive a favorable judgment, we expect we will appeal such judgment and expect that we will likely be required to post a bond in order to be allowed to appeal as set forth below. If any damage amount is entered as a part of the judgment, we will likely be required at that time to accrue a non-cash charge equal to the amount of such damages. Any such accrual will have an adverse effect on our results of operations for the applicable period. If we decide to appeal, such appeal may not be decided for several months and may require the posting of a bond in the face amount of up to 150% of 46 Table of Contents the judgment amount, if any. We do not expect the cash cost associated with posting such a bond to be material, but we would likely be required to secure such bond with collateral. The amount of collateral required by the provider of the bond would be determined based on several factors, such as the amount of our debt and our financial condition. If we are required to accrue a charge relating to, or post an appeal bond in connection with, the Medtronic litigation, we may not be able to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured credit facility in future periods. While we do not believe that accruing a charge and/or posting an appeal bond in connection with the Medtronic litigation will cause us to breach any such covenant, doing so may adversely affect our ability to comply with our maintenance covenants in our senior secured credit facility. If we breached any such covenant, we would need to seek to amend or refinance our senior secured credit facility. We believe that such an amendment could require us to pay upfront fees and an increased interest rate on our borrowings thereunder, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, we could refinance our senior secured credit facility, but we may not be able to do so on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain such an amendment or refinancing, we would suffer an event of default under such facility and the lenders thereto would have the right to accelerate the indebtedness outstanding thereunder. In addition, the lenders' obligations to extend letters of credit or make loans under our senior secured credit facility are dependent upon our ability to make our representations and warranties thereunder at the time such letters of credit are extended or such loan is made. If we are unable to make the representations and warranties in our senior secured credit facility at such time, we will be unable to borrow additional amounts under our senior secured credit facility in the future. These proceedings are costly and time consuming, and we cannot assure you that the outcome of any of these proceedings will be favorable to us. However, because Medtronic withdrew its request for injunctive relief from the trial court, we believe that it is likely that the final judgment will not prevent the continued marketing or sale of any of our products. If we do not prevail before the trial or appellate courts in overturning the jury verdict or reducing or eliminating the damages award in the jury verdict, we will have to pay the awarded damages and may have to pay royalties on a substantial portion of our future sales, and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Medtronic also could appeal from rulings adverse to it, which could result in an appellate decision with effects adverse to us on issues of liability and/or relief. In addition, Medtronic may attempt to request injunctive relief in the future, which, if granted, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding the litigation proceedings, we have implemented changes to our business processes intended to create an alternative process that we believe does not infringe Medtronic's patents. These changes do not affect the product design, but modify the final step prior to inspection in our manufacturing processes and the instructions for use of our products by physicians. We believe this to be standard practice. These changes require that our products be cooled prior to use and therefore rely on a property of our nitinol material that makes use of temperature rather than stress for expansion. The use of temperature for expansion of nitinol was disclaimed during the prosecution of the Medtronic patents. We do not expect any of these changes to impact the future sales of our products. In addition, we are considering establishing manufacturing operations in Europe for all of our devices that are sold in international markets. In addition to providing other benefits for our business, such as mitigating the risk inherent in relying on only one manufacturing facility the manufacture of our products outside of the United States would eliminate any claims for ongoing royalty payments on future sales with respect to such products sold outside of the United States. We cannot assure you that any of these changes will avoid future litigation or will not result in a subsequent finding of infringement of Medtronic's patents and/or patents held by others. If any of our modified business processes were found to infringe any such patents, we may be required to pay additional damages and royalties. We cannot assure you that such damages and royalties would not exceed the 11% rate 47 Table of Contents applied by the Medtronic case jury for past sales. Any such royalties may not be on commercially reasonable terms and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Also, if a court grants an injunction, we may be prevented from selling some or any infringing products. While we believe we have taken reasonable steps to inform third parties who use such products of the alternative process by changing the instructions for use that are referenced in the information that accompanies each such product, such third parties may not review such information and may not adopt the alternative process even if they do review the new instructions for use. To the extent such third parties continue to use the prior process, we may be liable for such use whether or not the alternative process infringes Medtronic's patents. We have filed and may in the future file patent litigation claims in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to protect our patent portfolio. If we are unsuccessful in these claims, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may initiate litigation to assert claims of infringement, enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how, or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, time consuming and divert management's attention from other business concerns. Furthermore, litigation may provoke third parties to assert claims against us and may put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not being issued. In August 2006, we brought a patent infringement action in Germany against Occlutech GmbH, an European manufacturer of cardiac occlusion devices, and DRABO Medizintechnik, based on the German part of one of our European patents, which was granted to us in October 2005 for intravascular occlusion devices and the method of manufacturing such devices. On July 31, 2007, the District Court in Düsseldorf entered a judgment in our favor finding that Occlutech and DRABO literally infringed the German part of our European patent. Under German practice, the court required us to post a bond in the amount of €1.0 million to secure our ability to respond to damages claimed by Occlutech in the event that the decision of the District Court is reversed on appeal or our patent is held invalid in related proceedings in the German patent court. The bond amount is not a limitation on such damages. On August 6, 2007, Occlutech filed an appeal against the District Court judgment before a German Court of Appeals contending that the District Court judgment was based on an overly broad interpretation of our European patent, and in addition, it initiated invalidation proceedings against the patent. On December 22, 2008, the German Court of Appeals dismissed Occlutech's appeal and entered a judgment in our favor finding that Occlutech infringed our patent. Occlutech has filed an appeal with the German Federal Court of Justice. A final decision on the appeal with the German Federal Court of Justice and a decision on the invalidation proceedings are not expected to be reached until 2010 or later. In addition, Occlutech initiated proceedings against our corresponding patents in Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden, seeking invalidity and non-infringement declarations. On October 29, 2008, the Patent Court in the Netherlands ruled in favor of Occlutech in the non-infringement declaration. The court did not rule on the invalidity claim. On November 3, 2008, we filed an appeal with the Dutch appellate court. On July 31, 2009, a United Kingdom patent court upheld the validity of our patent, but it ruled that the Occlutech products do not infringe on our patent. We intend to appeal the decision that Occlutech did not infringe on our patent. Final decisions in these actions are also not expected to be reached until 2010 or later. We cannot assure you that the outcome in any of these proceedings will be favorable to us, and if we do not prevail in one or more jurisdictions, we face the risk of increased competition and significant damages being awarded against us. We have also been forced to defend our patent rights in China against various entities, including Shanghai Shape Memory Alloy Company Ltd., a medical device manufacturer based in Shanghai, China, and Beijing Starway Medical Devices Ltd., a medical device manufacturer based in Beijing, both 48 Table of Contents of which in recent years have been manufacturing and exporting medical devices that we believe infringe our patent rights. We did not prevail in our lawsuits in China against these entities and two of our patents in China were invalidated as a result. Consequently, we are no longer able to assert rights under these patents within China and will need to rely primarily on foreign patents to prevent the importation of products from China into countries in which such importation would violate our local patent rights. In addition, their activities have resulted in litigation in India and could result in future and potentially costly litigation in other countries in which we have patent rights against importers and distributors of infringing products originating in China. In addition, we may not prevail in lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably. Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends on the proprietary nature of our technologies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the United States and key foreign countries for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. Our patent portfolio includes approximately 199 issued patents, the first of which expires in the United States in 2014 and in Europe in 2015, and approximately 110 pending patent applications. We cannot assure you that any pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents, that any current or future patents issued or licensed to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide a competitive advantage to us or prevent competitors from entering markets which we currently serve. Any required license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technologies as we do. Furthermore, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to defend them against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time-consuming to us, and we cannot assure you that such actions will be successful. The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights which we own or unsuccessful outcomes in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, foreign countries generally do not allow patents to cover methods for performing surgical procedures. If we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more directly with us, which could adversely affect our competitive position and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Debt Our substantial debt may adversely affect our financial condition and operating activities. We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2009, we have debt of $222.3 million outstanding. Based on that level of indebtedness and interest rates applicable as of 49 Table of Contents December 31, 2009, our annualized interest expense would be $7.9 million. In addition, we have $25.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and we have the ability to increase the aggregate amount of our Tranche B term loan under our senior secured credit facility by up to $75.0 million without the consent of any person other than the institutions agreeing to provide all or any portion of such increase. Although we believe that our current cash flow is sufficient to cover our annual interest expense for the foreseeable future, any increase in the amount of debt or any decline in the amount of cash available to make interest payments may require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have other significant consequences to our stockholders, including: requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, research and development, including clinical trials, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, research and development, including clinical trials, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; subjecting us to the risk of interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates; subjecting us to the possibility of an event of default under the financial and operating covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness; and limiting our ability to adjust to rapidly changing market conditions, reducing our ability to withstand competitive pressures and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions than our competitors with less debt. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow may require us to seek additional financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise capital through sales of our equity securities. If these or other kinds of additional financing become necessary, we cannot assure you that we could arrange such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance research and development, including clinical trials, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or for other purposes. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, we have $25.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and we have the ability to increase the aggregate amount of our Tranche B term loan under our senior secured credit facility by up to $75.0 million without the consent of any person other than the institutions agreeing to provide all or any portion of such increase. If we incur additional debt above the levels currently in effect, the risks associated with our leverage would increase. We are subject to restrictive debt covenants, which may restrict our operational flexibility. Our senior secured credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on and 50 Table of Contents redeem capital stock, make other restricted payments, make investments, sell our assets or enter into consolidations, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets. Our senior secured credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under our senior secured credit facility. Agreements governing any additional indebtedness we incur in the future may contain similar or more stringent covenants. Covenants in our existing or future debt agreements could limit our ability to take actions that we believe are in our best interests. If an event of default exists under our senior secured credit facility or any additional indebtedness we incur in the future, the lenders under such agreements could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. If any such lender accelerates the payment of one of our indebtednesses, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness that would become due as a result of any acceleration. Our obligations under our senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. Our obligations under our senior secured credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets. If we become insolvent or are liquidated, or if repayment under our senior secured credit facility is accelerated and we cannot repay such indebtedness, the lenders will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and the applicable agreements and instruments, including the right to foreclose on all of our and our subsidiaries' assets. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our controlling stockholders have substantial control over us and could influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. We are controlled by Welsh Carson, WCAS Capital Partners IV, L.P. and other individuals and entities affiliated with Welsh Carson, which we collectively refer to as the WCAS Stockholders, and Franck L. Gougeon, our director and co-founder, and other entities controlled by Mr. Gougeon, which we collectively refer to as the Gougeon Stockholders. The WCAS Stockholders and the Gougeon Stockholders beneficially own or control approximately 50.2% and 20.1%, respectively, of our common stock, and they have entered into a stockholders agreement with us in relation to their stock ownership. Accordingly, we are a "controlled company" as set forth in Rules 5605 and 5615 of the Nasdaq Global Market because more than 50% of our voting power is held by a group formed by the WCAS Stockholders and the Gougeon Stockholders. As a result, the WCAS Stockholders and the Gougeon Stockholders, if acting together, would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other material corporate transactions. They may also vote in a way with which minority stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to minority stockholders' interests. Any conflict of interests between the WCAS Stockholders and the Gougeon Stockholders, on the one hand, and the other holders of our common stock, on the other, may result in an actual or perceived conflict of interest on the part of our directors affiliated with the WCAS Stockholders and the Gougeon Stockholders. The existence or perception of such a conflict of interest could materially limit the ability of these directors to participate in consideration of the matter. In addition, the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. 51 Table of Contents Some provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us. Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the laws of Delaware, the state in which we are incorporated, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. These anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that they desire. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock even if permitted to do so under our senior secured credit facility. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be our stockholders' only source of gain on an investment in our common stock. Even if we decide in the future to pay any dividends, AGA is a holding company with no independent operations of its own. As a result, AGA depends on its direct and indirect subsidiaries for cash to pay its obligations and make dividend payments. Deterioration in the financial conditions, earnings or cash flow of our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay cash dividends or other distributions to AGA. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent upon AGA's receipt of cash from its subsidiaries. Such subsidiaries may be restricted from sending cash to AGA by, among other things, existing law or certain provisions of our senior secured credit facility the documents governing our future indebtedness that restrict our ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute cash or other assets. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We have experienced significant fluctuations in our results of operations from period to period, and we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. Such fluctuations have occurred primarily due to non-recurring items. For example, we recorded for 2005 a $29.0 million charge related to our one-time payment in settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit and a $50.8 million charge related to in-process research and development that we determined would not reach technical feasibility or hold an alternative use. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future from period to period due to many factors, including current and potential patent infringement lawsuits and the timing of our research and development expenditures, as well as the other factors described in this section. Any such fluctuation may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 52 Table of Contents We qualify as a controlled company within the meaning of the Nasdaq Global Market rules and, as a result, rely and expect to continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. We are a "controlled company" as set forth in Rules 5605 and 5615 of the Nasdaq Global Market, because more than 50% of our voting power is held by a group formed by the WCAS Stockholders and the Gougeon Stockholders. Under the Nasdaq Global Market rules, a "controlled company" may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq Global Market corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors and the requirement that directors nominations and executive compensation must be approved by a majority of independent directors or a nominating or compensation committee, as applicable, comprised solely of independent directors. Accordingly, stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq Global Market corporate governance requirements. 53 Table of Contents
