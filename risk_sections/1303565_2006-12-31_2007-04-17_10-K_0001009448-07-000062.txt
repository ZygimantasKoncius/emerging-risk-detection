ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the specific factors listed below, together with the cautionary statement under the caption "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements" and the other information included in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of any investment in our common stock. Risks Relating to Our Business We have a history of losses, and may not achieve profitability in the future, which would adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. From our inception on January 16, 2002 through December 31, 2006, we have incurred net losses of approximately $20.7 million. Tarpon has funded such losses and a portion of its acquisition costs through equity proceeds, credit facilities and the proceeds of its initial public offering. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operating losses, capital expenditures, debt payments and working capital requirements. We are planning to complete a private placement that has been in process since January 2007, and we are also planning a public offering, of our equity securities, in order to fund our operations and provide financial stability, but there can be no assurance of the timing or net proceeds of the same. Our liquidity is not sufficient to sustain operations or to meet our debt servicing requirements without at least the substantial portion of this financing. Management's plans, in addition to obtaining additional financing, include completing the cost reduction plan begun in January 2006, improved receivables and inventory management, improving of operating margins, and continuing the development of additional customers and markets through its sales initiatives. If we are unable to generate adequate funds from operations or raise additional funds, we will not be able to repay our existing debt or fund our operations, which may cease. Our level of indebtedness materially affects our operations and even our survival. As of December 31, 2006 our total consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money, including current maturities, was approximately $16.0 million. Subject to the limits on EWCO and Steelbank credit facilities, we may incur additional debt in the future. Our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, reducing cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. In addition, a material default in our indebtedness could result in the failure of our business. Our high level of debt and debt service obligations could: Limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or acquisitions; Reduce the amount of funds available to finance our operations, capital expenditures and activities; Increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and industry conditions, including increased competition; and place us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors. Covenant restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our ability to operate our business and, if we do not comply with them, may prevent us from borrowing under those facilities, require accelerated payements and may require us to seek to refinance our loans or to liquidate. We are currently in violation of certain financial covenants for the Steelbank credit facilities with our senior lender. As a result of these violations and cross collateral terms in our convertible note we are in violation of covenants with our convertible term note holder as well. We anticipate obtaining a waiver for Steelbank shortly, but we can not assure the same. We have also not made principal repayments to such noteholder from June 2006 through March 2007. We have entered into a restructuring agreement with the noteholder to resolve the missed principal payments, the effectiveness of which is dependant on our proposed equity financing. We are planning to complete a private placement that has been in process since January 2007. We are also planning a public offering of our equity securities in order to fund our operations and provide financial stability. However, there can be no assurance of the timing or net proceeds of these efforts. If we complete the same, and make certain payments to the noteholder, we will be in compliance with this obligation, as restructured. EWCO has a credit facility secured by all of its assets. Its loan agreement requires it to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio and minimum tangible net worth. It also generally prohibits dividends and limits EWCO's ability to make capital expenditures and incur additional debt. Steelbank has a credit facility secured by all of its personal property. Its credit facility prohibits Steelbank from guaranteeing additional indebtedness, incurring indebtedness, creating liens, paying dividends, making certain types of investments, entering into transactions with affiliates, making capital expenditures, selling assets, merging with other companies or entering into any transactions outside of the ordinary course of business. It also requires it to maintain certain financial tangible net worth debt service coverage and interest coverage. These covenants for EWCO and Steelbank affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Moreover, our failure to comply with the financial or other covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could prevent us from borrowing under our credit facilities, require accelerated payements and could cause us to seek to refinance our borrowings. Tarpon has a convertible term note secured by certain assets of Tarpon and its subsidiaries and the equity interests of Tarpon's subsidiaries. The note requires Tarpon to use the proceeds to repay certain obligations, finance acquisitions and fund other working capital needs. In addition, as long as 25% of the principal amount of the note is outstanding, Tarpon is, without the prior written consent of the holder of convertible term note, prevented from declaring or paying dividends, issuing or redeeming certain types of preferred stock and equity, materially altering or reorganizing the business, incurring, assuming, guaranteeing or canceling any additional indebtedness (exclusive of certain trade debt, debt incurred to finance the purchase of equipment, financing incurred to replace debt on terms no less favorable than the debt being replaced and other debt not considered to have a material impact on the balance sheet). It also provides the lender with first right of refusal to provide additional financing to Tarpon or any of its subsidiaries subject to certain terms and conditions. Rising interest rates have a substantial impact on our interest expense under our working capital loans and adversely impact our ability to make our debt payments. Interest under our existing and proposed working capital facilities and convertible note accrues at fluctuating rates. Rising interest rates could have a substantial impact on our interest expense and will impact our ability to make our debt payments. As of December 31, 2006, each 1% increase in prime rates would result in an approximate increase of $137,000 in our yearly interest expense under such facilities, assuming they are at the maximum permitted amounts. We do not have a significant combined operating history with our acquired companies, so historical financial information is not necessarily a good indicator of future results of operations or financial condition; we have limited experience operating and integrating steel tube and pipe and steel storage rack system manufacturers and distributors. In 2004, we acquired EWCO and Steelbank, and in 2005, we acquired Haines Road, which was combined with Steelbank. All of our senior management group joined us in 2005 or later. As a result, our experience as a unified enterprise in operating steel manufacturers and distributors is very limited, and the financial information regarding our acquired companies included in this report substantially reflects their operations before we acquired, managed and controlled them and are not indicators of their future results of operation or financial condition. In addition, our lack of a combined operating history may result in difficulty integrating our operations, service interruptions to our customers, inefficiencies and conflicts. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to operate our businesses will be adversely impacted.. Our present and future performance depends on the continued service of our key sales, production and senior management personnel and consultants. Our key employees include James W. Bradshaw, our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick J. Hook, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and C. David Weaver, Vice President of Sales & Engineering in EWCO's SpaceRak(R) division. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or entities could have an adverse effect on us. We lost our prior Chief Financial Officer and we are conducting a search for a replacement. We do not maintain any significant key man life insurance on any of our key personnel. Our internal financial reporting procedures are still being developed and we will need to allocate significant resources to meet applicable internal financial reporting standards. Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006. Based on their evaluation and review, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that these controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, are not operating effectively. There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with such evaluation that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Until April 2004, we consisted only of a holding company with no operations. In April and May 2004, we acquired EWCO and Steelbank. These companies were established private companies with accounting procedures not suitable for public company reporting. In February 2005, we acquired Haines Road, which was combined with Steelbank. This was one operation of a larger private company, also with accounting procedures which were not suitable for public company reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm identified a variety of material weaknesses in our internal financial reporting procedures. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The material weaknesses are as follows: A. A lack of formalized accounting policies and procedures, including written procedures for monthly, quarterly and annual closing of our financial books and records. B. A lack of common systems or a common chart of accounts and we use spreadsheets to perform consolidations, which has resulted in errors. C. Insufficient resources and knowledge to adequately complete the process and documenting, testing, and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. D. Account reconciliations and supporting documentation not prepared on a timely basis. E. Duties and control activities within the finance function have not been appropriately segregated. F. The Company does not have a formal process to ensure that appropriate system access is granted. G. A lack of adequate process to identify and ensure that non-standard journal entries are subject to an appropriate level of review. H. Little review or oversight of the reporting process which has resulted in the inability to detect errors. I. The Company's invoicing system relies on certain manual controls which may not be sufficient to minimize the risk of incorrect revenue recognition, and J. The Company is required to comply with the provisions of Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires the Company to document, test, and evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting and have its independent auditor conduct an evaluation of and report on management's evaluation process in the near future. In addition, we will also be required to audit and report on the effectiveness of internal controls. All material weaknesses identified in this process are required to be disclosed in the Company's reporting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our experience with this documentation, testing and audit process has identified that significant resources are required to complete this exercise and considerable costs are incurred. We do not believe that the Company currently has the resources or knowledge to adequately complete this process, which could result in a failure to file the appropriate reports with the SEC. As a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. We are taking steps to unify the financial reporting of all of our component companies, to increase our accounting and information technology staff and to put in place internal controls concerning accounting entries and adjustments, with full documentation, which are responsive to the issues raised by our independent auditors, and, as of this time, we have made progress on these points. We have hired additional staff and are in the initial planning phase of upgrading our information technology systems. These efforts require significant time and resources. If we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, our reported financial information may be inaccurate and we will encounter difficulties in the audit or review of our financial statements by our independent auditors, which in turn may have material adverse effects on our ability to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and to comply with our SEC reporting obligations. Our products are viewed as commodities and are subject to intense competition based principally on price, and we may not be able to compete effectively with companies with greater financial resources. Our structural and mechanical steel tubing products are commodities and our custom racking products have commodity aspects, although they include design and engineering features. As a result, we are subject to intense competition, principally based on price and secondarily based on how closely the product conforms to specifications, product availability, delivery and service. Some of our competitors are larger than we are, have larger product lines, have more diversified businesses, have well-established reputations and customer relationships and have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and management resources than we do and are more able to engage in price competition. Our products have limited geographic markets, which may adversely affect our ability to grow our sales. Because of the size and weight of structural and mechanical steel tubing and the resulting costs of transportation and price competition, it is generally not cost effective to ship these products more than 800 miles from the manufacturing plant. This and customers' short lead-time requirements limit the market for our steel tubing products. Our rack products have a larger geographic market area, but the same is also subject to physical limits. The volatile nature of steel prices has and could adversely affect our sales and operating profits. The cost of steel for manufacturing our products represented approximately 67% of Company revenues in 2005 and approximately 62% in 2006. As a result, steel prices, which are highly volatile and cyclical in nature, materially affect our business. Changes in steel prices have a significant impact on the margins of our products. While we attempt to recover any increase in steel costs by increasing the price of our products, increases in the prices of our products might not fully compensate for steel price increases and can lag behind increases in steel prices, adversely affecting our gross profit margins. Due to inventory carrying costs and general market dynamics, decreases in steel costs have historically resulted in reduction of volume and gross profit margins. Steel prices for our base steel coil declined approximately 15% over the first nine months of 2006 and increased approximately 12% over the last three months of 2006. We are dependent on a few suppliers for a significant portion of our steel, so interruption of that supply could impair our ability to manufacture our products or require us to pay higher prices to obtain steel. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we purchased approximately 17% in dollar value of our steel from four suppliers. We are currently on cash terms and also have payment plans with a number of our steel suppliers.While we believe steel is generally available from a number of suppliers, the loss of any of our present suppliers, interruption of production at one or more of these suppliers or any other disruption in the supply of steel from these suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture our products or require us to pay higher prices to obtain steel from other sources. We do not intend to maintain significant inventories of steel. A majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that could subject us to additional labor costs or strikes. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 143 EWCO employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which expires in October 2009 and approximately 34 Steelbank employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers Union, which expires in November of 2008. We believe our relations with these employees are good. We are dependent on third parties to transport our products, so their failure to transport our products could adversely affect our earnings, sales and geographic market. We use third parties for the majority of our shipping and transportation needs. If these parties fail to deliver our products in a timely fashion, including due to lack of available trucks or drivers, labor stoppages, or traffic delays at the U.S. or Canadian borders, or if there is an increase in transportation costs, including due to increased fuel costs, it would have a material adverse effect on our earnings and could reduce our sales and geographic market. Steelbank's operations are located in Canada, and exchange rate fluctuations between the US and Canadian dollar may adversely affect our results of operations. Steelbank's sales and operating costs are transacted primarily in Canadian dollars. As a United States Company, we will be exposed to cash flow and earnings volatility as a result of fluctuations in relative currency values. In particular, our results of operations may be adversely affected by a strengthening of the United States dollar against the Canadian dollar. A strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar would adversely affect our ability to export products manufactured in Canada. Seasonal fluctuations affect sales for our products and may adversely affect our cash flow. We experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products. Historically, the demand for our steel tubing products typically peaks during the first and second calendar quarters, while demand for our steel storage rack systems typically peaks during the third and fourth calendar quarters. The timing of these fluctuations has been dependent on the overall economy and may change as our customer and product mix change. Equipment failures would interfere with production and increase costs and adversely affect our revenues. Our manufacturing processes depend on production mills and related equipment, which are occasionally out of service as a result of mechanical failures. We may experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures. Interruptions in our production capabilities will increase production costs and reduce our sales and earnings. Furthermore, any interruption in production capability may require us to make capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, loss of energy, explosions and adverse weather conditions. We are dependent on a small sales force for a majority of our sales, so losing any of them would adversely affect our business. We currently have an internal sales force of approximately six persons. Our sales force accounted for a substantial majority of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. Therefore, the loss of any of our sales employees may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on our distributors for a significant portion of our SpaceRak(R) sales, so their failure to sell our products adequately would adversely affect our business. We depend on our distributors for a significant portion of our sales of SpaceRak(R) products. If our distributors fail to market, promote and sell our products adequately, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Purchasers of our products may assert product liability claims against us, which may adversely affect our financial condition. Actual or claimed defects in our products could give rise to product liability claims against us. We might be sued because of injury or death, property damage, loss of production or suspension of operations resulting from actual or claimed defects in our products. Regardless of whether we are ultimately determined to be liable, we might incur significant legal expenses not covered by insurance. In addition, products liability litigation could damage our reputation and impair our ability to market our products. Litigation could also impair our ability to retain products liability insurance or make our insurance more expensive. We have product liability insurance with a liability limit of $5,000,000 for U.S. operations and $4,291,000 for Canadian operations. We could incur product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are subject to substantial deductibles, or we may incur uninsured product liability costs. If we are subject to an uninsured or inadequately insured products liability claim based on our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Environmental, health and safety laws regulating the operation of our business could increase the costs of producing our products and expose us to environmental claims. Our business is subject to numerous U.S. and Canadian local, state, provincial and federal laws and regulations concerning environmental, health and safety matters, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials. Violations of such laws and regulations could lead to substantial fines and penalties. Also, there are risks of substantial costs and liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of past or present contamination, at current or former properties used or owned by us and at third-party disposal sites, regardless of fault or the legality of the original activities that led to such contamination. Moreover, future developments, such as changes in laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement or interpretation of laws and regulations, and claims for property damage or personal injury would cause us to incur substantial losses or expenditures. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws, regulations, enforcement proceedings or private claims might have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock may be delisted by the American Stock Exchange, which would adversely affect the price of our common stock. The American Stock Exchange advised us in September 2006 of a potential delisting due to the lack of a total of three independent directors and a deterioration in our financial position. We have since appointed a third independent director and were given until mid January 2007 to improve our financial position through equity financings and a restructuring of our convertible note debt. That date was subsequently extended to May 31, 2007. We may not achieve the necessary benchmarks by such date and will then have to request an extension from AMEX, which it could grant, if at all, in its sole discretion. If we fail to meet the benchmarks by the deadline, it is expected that AMEX will seek a delisting of our Common Stock. If we became delisted, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market in the so-called "pink sheets" or, if available, the NASD's Electronic Bulletin Board, and there can be no assurance our common stock will be quoted on such systems. In such case, an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of our securities or to obtain accurate market quotations for them. If our Common Stock were delisted from the American Stock Exchange, they may become subject to Rule 15g9, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which imposes sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell "penny stock" securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Application of this rule could adversely affect the ability, willingness or both of broker-dealers to sell our securities. The market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly and there is presently not a significant trading market for the Common Stock. The market price of our Common Stock has been volatile and has been trading at historical low prices. There is currently not a significant trading market for the Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange, and holders of our Common Stock might find it difficult to sell their Common Stock. Also, changes in our business, our results of operations, our financial condition, our industry, the economy, stock markets in general and trading in our stock in particular could cause the market price of our shares to fluctuate substantially. The market price of the Common Stock may be depressed by shares eligible for future sale, shares reserved for future issuance upon the exercise of options and warrants and registration rights we have granted. Future sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market or the perception that such sales may occur could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. As of April 2, 2007, there are 4,993,712 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Warrants and optional convertible note shares to purchase an aggregate of 4,351,448 Common Stock were then outstanding and options to purchase a total of 519,785 Common Stock were then granted under our option plan. Our outstanding Common Stock and the Common Stock underlying these warrants, convertible securities and options are either now eligible for sale under Rule 144 or will be eligible beginning at varying times in the future. In connection with a private placement we are conducting, we expect to register, under the Securities Act of 1933, a total of 5,600,000 shares sold and to be sold and related warrant shares, as well as warrant shares and shares issuable on conversion of convertible securities related to prior financings, the amount of which is not presently fixed, and which together could total in excess of 10,000,000 shares All of the above represents a significant overhang on the trading market for our Common Stock and may serve to depress the trading price of our Common Stock. The Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and corporate law have anti-takeover effects. Some provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even if that change might be beneficial to our shareholders. Our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might make acquiring control of us difficult, including provisions limiting rights to call special meetings of shareholders and regulating the ability of our shareholders to nominate directors for election at annual meetings of our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors has the authority, without further approval of our shareholders, to issue preferred shares having such rights, preferences and privileges as the board of directors may determine. Any such issuance of preferred shares could, under some circumstances, have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company and might adversely affect the rights of holders of Common Stock. In addition, we are subject to Michigan statutes regulating business combinations, takeovers and control share acquisitions, which might also hinder or delay a change in control of the Company. Anti-takeover provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, anti-takeover provisions that could be included in the preferred shares when issued and the Michigan statutes regulating business combinations, takeovers and control share acquisitions can depress the market price of our securities and can limit the shareholders' ability to receive a premium on their shares by discouraging takeover and tender offer bids, even if such events could be viewed as beneficial by our shareholders. Our directors serve staggered three-year terms, and directors may be removed only for cause. Our restated articles of incorporation also set the minimum number of directors constituting the entire Board at three and the maximum at fifteen, and they require approval of holders of 90% of our voting shares to amend these provisions. These provisions could have an anti-takeover effect by making it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise or by removing incumbent directors. These provisions could delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interests, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the Common Stock held by our shareholders. See "Description of Securities." The lead underwriter of our initial public offering may exert significant influence over us. We agreed that for a period ending in 2011, we would allow Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC the right to appoint a non-voting observer to our board of directors. Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC appointed Stephan Stein, its chief operating officer, as its non-voting observer. The observer is entitled to attend all meetings of the board of directors, to receive all notices and other correspondence and communications we send to the board of directors and to receive any compensation that may be paid to our non-employee directors. We have also entered into an agreement for Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC to provide non-exclusive investment banking services to us indefinitely, unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew before the expiration of the then current one-year term. These arrangements may enable Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC to exert significant influence over us through the presence of its designee at our board meetings and through its provision of investment banking services to us.
