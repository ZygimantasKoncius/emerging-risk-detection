D. Risk Factors Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described in this section, which is intended to disclose all of the risks that we consider material based on the information currently available to us, as well as all the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects, Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Credit, Market and Other Risk and Selected Statistical Data. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of the factors discussed below. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these factors. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks faced by us described in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Forward-Looking Statements. Risks Related to Our Business If the global economy remains weak or deteriorates again, our credit-related losses may increase, and the value of the financial instruments we hold may decrease, resulting in losses. We have been, and may continue to be, affected by the weak global economy. Despite some signs of a slow recovery, the global economy remains susceptible to developments in various economic and political areas. For example, the recent sovereign credit crises in some European Union member states and the political instabilities in some parts of Asia have raised serious concerns of another global financial downturn. If the current weakness in the global economy continues or worsens, the availability of credit may remain limited or become further limited, and some of our borrowers may default on their loan obligations to us, increasing our credit losses. Some of our credit derivative transactions may also be negatively affected, including the protection we sold through single name credit default swaps, index and basket credit default swaps, and credit linked notes. The notional amounts of these protections sold as of March 31, 2010 were ¥2.9 trillion, ¥0.9 trillion and ¥0.2 trillion, respectively. In addition, if credit market conditions remain stagnant or worsen, our capital funding structure may need to be adjusted or our funding costs may increase, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 7 Table of Contents Furthermore, we have incurred losses, and may incur further losses, as a result of changes in the fair value of our financial instruments resulting from deteriorating market conditions. For example, declines in fair value of our investment securities, particularly equity investment securities, resulted in our recording impairment losses of ¥1,543.8 billion, ¥858.9 billion and ¥117.5 billion for each of the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2010. As of March 31, 2010, approximately 40% of our total assets were financial instruments for which we measure fair value on a recurring basis, and less than 1% of our total assets were financial instruments for which we measure fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, in order to establish the fair value of these instruments, we rely on quoted market prices. If the value of these financial instruments declines, a corresponding write-down may be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations. For more information on our valuation method for financial instruments, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsCritical Accounting Estimates. We may suffer additional credit-related losses in the future if our borrowers are unable to repay their loans as expected or if the measures we take in reaction to, or in anticipation of, our borrowers deteriorating repayment abilities prove inappropriate or insufficient. When we lend money or commit to lend money, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. We may incur significant credit losses or have to provide for a significant amount of additional allowance for credit losses if:  large borrowers become insolvent or must be restructured;  domestic or global economic conditions, either generally or in particular industries in which large borrowers operate, deteriorate;  the value of the collateral we hold, such as real estate or securities, declines; or  we are adversely affected by corporate credibility issues among our borrowers, to an extent that is worse than anticipated. As a percentage of total loans, nonaccrual and restructured loans and accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more ranged from 1.70% to 2.18% as of the five recent fiscal year-ends. The percentage increased to 2.18% as of March 31, 2010 compared to the previous year-end mainly due to downgrades in the credit ratings of borrowers in the domestic manufacturing, communication and information services, wholesale and retail, services and other industry segments and the foreign governments and official institutions segment. In particular, as of March 31, 2010, our domestic loans accounted for 78.1% of our total loans outstanding, and the domestic portion of our nonaccrual and restructured loans and accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more accounted for 85.3% of the total of such loans. If the recession in Japan worsens, our problem loans and credit-related expenses may increase. An increase in problem loans and credit-related expenses would adversely affect our results of operations, weaken our financial condition and erode our capital base. For a discussion of our problem loans, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial Condition and Selected Statistical DataLoan Portfolio. We may provide additional loans, equity capital or other forms of support to troubled borrowers in order to facilitate their restructuring and revitalization efforts. We may also forbear from exercising some or all of our rights as a creditor against them, and we may forgive loans to them in conjunction with their debt restructuring. These practices may substantially increase our exposure to troubled borrowers and increase our losses. Credit losses may also increase if we elect, or are forced by economic or other considerations, to sell or write off our problem loans at a larger discount, in a larger amount or in a different time or manner, than we may otherwise want. Although we, from time to time, enter into credit derivative transactions, including credit default swap contracts, to manage our credit risk exposure, such transactions may not provide the protection against credit defaults that we intended due to counterparty defaults or otherwise. The credit default swap contracts could also result in significant losses. As of March 31, 2010, the notional amount of the credit default swaps we sold was 8 Table of Contents ¥3.8 trillion. In addition, negative changes in financial market conditions may restrict the availability and liquidity of credit default swaps. For more information on our credit derivative transactions, see Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our loan losses could prove to be materially different from our estimates and could materially exceed our current allowance for credit losses, in which case we may need to provide for additional allowance for credit losses and may also record credit losses beyond our allowance. Our allowance for credit losses in our loan portfolio is based on evaluations about customers creditworthiness and the value of collateral we hold. Negative changes in economic conditions or our borrowers repayment abilities could require us to provide for additional allowance. For example, as a result of the weakening of the financial condition of borrowers, especially in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and other industry segments, provision for credit losses increased to ¥647.8 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 from ¥626.9 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2010, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased to 1.43% compared to 1.15% as of March 31, 2009, since the allowance for credit losses increased due to the credit quality deterioration of borrowers in those segments, whereas our total outstanding loans decreased. The regulatory standards or guidance on establishing allowances may also change, causing us to change some of the evaluations used in determining the allowances. As a result, we may need to provide for additional allowance for credit losses. For a discussion of our allowance policy, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial Condition. If the Japanese stock market or other global markets decline in the future, we may incur losses on our securities portfolio and our capital ratios will be adversely affected. A decline in Japanese stock prices could reduce the value of the Japanese domestic marketable equity securities that we hold, which accounted for 8.3% of our total investment securities portfolio, or 2.2% of our total assets, as of March 31, 2010, a decrease from 10.9% and an increase from 2.0% as of March 31, 2009, respectively. The Nikkei Stock Average, which is an average of 225 blue chip stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, declined from ¥11,244.40 at April 1, 2010 to ¥9,572.49 at August 9, 2010, mainly reflecting investor sentiment that remains cautious in light of uncertainties surrounding the global financial and capital markets. If stock market prices further decline or do not improve, we may incur additional losses on our securities portfolio. Further declines in the Japanese stock market or other global markets may also materially and adversely affect our capital ratios and financial condition. For a detailed discussion of our holdings of marketable equity securities and the effect of market declines on our capital ratios, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Adequacy and Selected Statistical DataInvestment Portfolio. Because a large portion of our assets are located in Japan and our business operations are conducted primarily in Japan, we may incur further losses if economic conditions in Japan worsen. Our performance is particularly affected by the general economic conditions of Japan where we are headquartered and conduct a significant amount of our business. As of March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, 71.8%, 73.9% and 74.5% of our total assets were related to Japanese domestic assets, respectively, including Japanese national government and Japanese government agency bonds which accounted for 45.2%, 69.8% and 75.8% of our total investment securities portfolio. Moreover, approximately three quarters of our total interest and non-interest income related to Japanese domestic income. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, although there were early signs of a recovery of economic conditions in Japan from the recent global recession that began in the second half of 2008, a number of factors still remain that could thwart the recovery of, or lead to another downturn in the Japanese economy. For example, between April 15, 2010 and July 1, 2010, the Nikkei Stock Average declined from ¥11,273.79 to ¥9,191.60. In addition, Japans real gross domestic product decreased 2.0 percentage points in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, which was a continuing decrease for the second consecutive year. Japans consumer price index for March 2010 decreased 1.2 percentage points year-on-year, and Japans unemployment rate for March 2010 rose 0.2 percentage points year-on-year to 5.0%. Japans economic recovery may be further influenced by increased 9 Table of Contents uncertainties surrounding the Japanese political environment, particularly after the ruling Democratic Party lost control of the upper house of the Japanese Diet in the national elections in July 2010. Due to the high concentration of our investment portfolio in Japanese national government and Japanese government agency bonds, significant interest rate fluctuations, and resulting price fluctuations in those securities, may adversely affect our capital ratios. In addition, the economic conditions in Japan are affected by changes in the global economy, which also have a direct impact on our foreign operations. If the economic conditions in Japan or globally remain stagnant or deteriorate, we may report losses on our Japanese national government and Japanese government agency bonds as well as Japanese equity securities. For a further discussion of our results of operations on a geographic basis, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsA. Operating ResultsGeographic Segment Analysis. Deteriorating or stagnant economic conditions may also result in a decrease in the volume in financial transactions in general, which in turn may reduce our income from fees and commissions. For example, our income from fees and commission decreased to ¥1,139.5 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 from ¥1,188.5 billion for the previous fiscal year mainly due to lower transaction volume. If our strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley fails, we could suffer financial or reputational loss. In an effort to better cope with the rapidly changing global business and regulatory environment, we have recently entered into, and plan to continue to seek opportunities for, arrangements to strengthen our global strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley. In May 2010, we and Morgan Stanley created two joint venture securities companies in Japan, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd., or MUMSS, and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd., or MSMS. We and Morgan Stanley integrated our respective securities subsidiaries in Japan, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co., Ltd., or MUS, and Morgan Stanley Japan Securities Co., Ltd., to establish the two joint venture companies. We hold a 60% economic interest in each of MUMSS and MSMS through Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings Co., Ltd., or MUSHD, an intermediate holding company, and Morgan Stanley indirectly holds a 40% economic interest in each of MUMSS and MSMS. We hold a 60% voting interest through MUSHD and Morgan Stanley indirectly holds a 40% voting interest in MUMSS, while we hold a 49% voting interest through MUSHD and Morgan Stanley indirectly holds a 51% voting interest in MSMS. Because MUSs business represented our core securities business in Japan prior to the formation of the joint venture companies, and because the joint venture companies will be the primary channel through which our retail and wholesale securities business will be conducted, the failure of the joint venture companies to achieve their intended goals due to unanticipated difficulties in integrating their IT or internal control systems or personnel, or the inability to cross-sell products and services as expected, could negatively affect our retail and wholesale securities business. In addition, we hold an approximately 20% interest (on a fully diluted basis) in Morgan Stanley. With our current interest in Morgan Stanley, we cannot control its operations and assets or make major decisions without the consent of other shareholders. Thus, Morgan Stanley may make a decision that is inconsistent with our interests. Although we do not control Morgan Stanley, given the magnitude of investment that we have made, if Morgan Stanley encounters financial or other business difficulties, we may suffer a financial loss on our investment or damage to our reputation. For a more detailed discussion of our joint ventures with, and investment in, Morgan Stanley, see Item 4.B. Information on the CompanyBusiness Overview and Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsRecent Developments. Because of our loans to consumers and our shareholdings in companies engaged in consumer lending, changes in the business or regulatory environment for consumer finance companies in Japan may further adversely affect our financial results. We have a large loan portfolio in the consumer lending industry as well as large shareholdings in subsidiaries and equity method investees in the consumer finance industry. Our domestic loans to consumers amount to approximately one-fifth of our total outstanding loans. 10 Table of Contents The Japanese government has been implementing regulatory reforms affecting the consumer lending industry in recent years. In December 2006, the Diet passed legislation to reform the regulations relating to the consumer lending business, including amendments to the Law Concerning Acceptance of Investment, Cash Deposit and Interest Rate, etc., which, effective June 18, 2010, reduced the maximum permissible interest rate from 29.2% per annum to 20% per annum. The regulatory reforms also included amendments to the Law Concerning Lending Business, which, effective June 18, 2010, abolished the so-called gray-zone interest. Gray-zone interest refers to interest rates exceeding the limits stipulated by the Interest Rate Restriction Law (between 15% per annum to 20% per annum depending on the amount of principal). Prior to June 18, 2010, gray-zone interest was permitted under certain conditions set forth in the Law Concerning Lending Business. As a result of the regulatory reforms, all interest rates are now subject to the lower limits imposed by the Interest Rate Restriction Law, compelling lending institutions, including our consumer finance subsidiaries and equity method investees, to lower the interest rates they charge borrowers. The new regulations that became effective on June 18, 2010 may also have a further negative impact on the business of consumer finance companies as those new regulations require, among other things, consumer finance companies to review the repayment capability of borrowers before making loans to individual borrowers, thereby limiting the amount of borrowing available to those borrowers. In addition, as a result of decisions by the Supreme Court of Japan prior to June 18, 2010 imposing stringent requirements under the Law Concerning Lending Business for charging gray-zone interest rates, consumer finance companies have experienced a significant increase in borrowers claims for reimbursement of previously collected interest payments in excess of the limits stipulated by the Interest Rate Restriction Law. As of March 31, 2009 and 2010, we had ¥77 billion and ¥84 billion of allowance for repayment of excess interest, respectively. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010, we recorded provisions for repayment of excess interest of ¥47.9 billion and ¥44.8 billion, respectively. For the same periods, one of our equity method investees engaged in consumer lending had a negative impact of ¥15.8 billion and ¥23.1 billion, respectively, on equity in losses of equity method investees in our consolidated statement of operations. These developments have adversely affected, and these and any future developments may further adversely affect, the operations and financial condition of our subsidiaries and borrowers which are engaged in consumer lending, which in turn may affect the value of our related shareholdings and loan portfolio. In particular, to further strengthen our consumer finance business as a core business of our group, in August 2008, we increased our interest in our consolidated subsidiary, Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS Co., Ltd., and separately, in October 2008, increased our interest in an equity method investee, ACOM CO., LTD. As a result of these investments, any negative developments in the consumer finance industry may have a greater impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Increases in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our bond portfolio. The aggregate estimated fair value of the Japanese government and corporate bonds and foreign bonds, including US Treasury bonds, that we hold has increased in recent fiscal years to 22.9% of our total assets as of March 31, 2010. In particular, the Japanese government and Japanese government agency bonds accounted for 20.2% of our total assets as of March 31, 2010. For a detailed discussion of our bond portfolio, see Selected Statistical DataInvestment Portfolio. The Bank of Japan has been maintaining a very low policy rate (uncollateralized overnight call rate) of 0.10% in an effort to lift the economy out of deflation. Short-term interest rates continue to decline because of the Bank of Japans so-called monetary easing policy. Interest rates in other major global financial markets, including the United States and the European Union, have remained at historic low levels in recent years. An increase in relevant interest rates, particularly if such increase is unexpected or sudden, may have a significant negative effect on the value of our bond portfolio. See Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsBusiness Environment. 11 Table of Contents Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in transaction losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as well as foreign currency translation losses with respect to our foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the Japanese yen create transaction gains or losses on the translation into Japanese yen of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. To the extent that our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are not matched in the same currency or appropriately hedged, we could incur losses due to future foreign exchange rate fluctuations. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the average balance of our foreign interest-bearing assets was ¥47.6 trillion and the average balance of our foreign interest-bearing liabilities was ¥33.7 trillion, representing 27.1% of our average total interest-earning assets and 21.3% of our average total interest-bearing liabilities during the same period. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net foreign exchange gains, which primarily include transaction gains on the translation into Japanese yen of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and net gains on currency derivatives instruments entered into for trading purposes, were ¥216.7 billion, compared to net foreign exchange losses of ¥206.2 billion for the previous fiscal year. In addition, we may incur foreign currency translation losses with respect to our foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The average exchange rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was ¥92.85 per US$1.00, compared to the average exchange rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 of ¥100.54 per US$1.00. The average exchange rate for the conversion of the US dollar financial statements of some of our foreign subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 was ¥93.57 per US$1.00, compared to the average exchange rate for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 of ¥103.46 per US$1.00. The change in the average exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the US dollar and other foreign currencies had the effect of decreasing total revenue by ¥181.3 billion, net interest income by ¥67.0 billion and income from continuing operations before income tax expense by ¥78.3 billion, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. For more information on foreign exchange gains and losses and foreign currency translation gains and losses, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsA. Operating ResultsResults of Operations. Any adverse changes in the business of Union Bank, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary in the United States, could significantly affect our results of operations. Union Bank, N.A., or Union Bank, is the primary subsidiary of UnionBanCal Corporation, or UNBC, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. Union Bank has historically contributed to a significant portion of our net income. UNBC reported net income of $608.1 million and $269.9 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, and a net loss of $65.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. Compared to fiscal years prior to the fiscal year ended March 2009, any adverse developments which could arise at Union Bank will have a greater negative impact on our results of operation and financial condition, because Union Bank became, through UNBC, our wholly owned subsidiary in November 2008 compared with approximately 64% ownership in prior years. Moreover, the risks relating to Union Bank have increased as Union Bank has been expanding its business through acquisitions of community banks. In April 2010, Union Bank acquired approximately $600 million in total assets and assumed more than $400 million in deposits of Tamalpais Bank, a California-based bank, and acquired approximately $3.2 billion in total assets and assumed approximately $2.5 billion in deposits of Frontier Bank, a Washington-based bank, pursuant to its respective purchase and assumption agreements with the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. If Union Bank is unable to achieve the benefits expected from its business strategies, including its business expansion strategy through acquisitions of failing community banks, we will suffer an adverse financial impact. Other factors that have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, Union Banks results include adverse economic conditions in California, including the downturn in the real estate and housing industries in California, substantial competition in the California banking market, uncertainty over the US economy, the threat of terrorist attacks, fluctuating oil prices, rising interest rates, negative trends in debt ratings, and additional costs which may arise from enterprise-wide compliance, or failure to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, such as the US Bank Secrecy Act and related amendments under the USA PATRIOT Act. 12 Table of Contents We may incur further losses as a result of financial difficulties relating to other financial institutions, both directly and through the effect they may have on the overall banking environment and on their borrowers. Some domestic and foreign financial institutions, including banks, non-bank lending and credit institutions, securities companies and insurance companies, have experienced declining asset quality and capital adequacy and other financial problems. This may lead to severe liquidity and solvency problems, which have in the past resulted in the liquidation, government control or restructuring of affected institutions. Many banks, securities companies, insurance companies and other financial institutions, especially US and European institutions, continue to face significant pressure due to declining asset quality as a result of the continuing weakness of the global financial markets and due to legislative and regulatory developments affecting them. Allegations or governmental prosecution of improper trading activities or inappropriate business conduct of a specific financial institution could also negatively affect the public perception of other global financial institutions individually and the global financial industry as a whole. These developments may continue to adversely affect our financial results. Financial difficulties relating to financial institutions could adversely affect us because we have extended loans, some of which may need to be classified as nonaccrual and restructured loans, to banks, securities companies, insurance companies and other financial institutions that are not our consolidated subsidiaries. Our loans to banks and other financial institutions have been more than 5% of our total loans as of each year-end in the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, with the percentage increasing from 7.5% to 7.7% between March 31, 2009 and 2010. We may also be adversely affected because we are a shareholder of some other banks and financial institutions that are not our consolidated subsidiaries, including Japanese regional banks as part of our general equity investment securities portfolio. In addition, we held an approximately 20% interest in Morgan Stanley on a fully diluted basis as of March 31, 2010. We may also be adversely affected because we enter into transactions, such as derivative transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other banks and financial institutions as counterparties. For example, we enter into credit derivatives with banks, broker-dealers, insurance and other financial institutions for managing credit risk exposures, for facilitating client transactions, and for proprietary trading purpose. The notional amount of the protection we sold through these instruments was ¥4.1 trillion as of March 31, 2010. In addition, financial difficulties relating to financial institutions could indirectly have an adverse effect on us because:  we may be requested to participate in providing assistance to support distressed financial institutions that are not our consolidated subsidiaries;  the government may elect to provide regulatory, tax, funding or other benefits to those financial institutions to strengthen their capital, facilitate their sale or otherwise, which in turn may increase their competitiveness against us;  deposit insurance premiums could rise if deposit insurance funds prove to be inadequate;  bankruptcies or government support or control of financial institutions could generally undermine confidence in financial institutions or adversely affect the overall banking environment; and  negative media coverage of the financial industry, regardless of its accuracy and applicability to us, could affect customer or investor sentiment, harm our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our business or the price of our securities. Our strategy to expand the range of our financial products and services and the geographic scope of our business globally may fail if we are unable to anticipate or manage new or expanded risks that entail such expansion. We continue to seek opportunities to expand the range of our products and services beyond our traditional banking and trust businesses, through development and introduction of new products and services or through acquisitions of or investments in financial institutions with products and services that complement our business. For 13 Table of Contents example, taking advantage of our financial holding company status which enables us to underwrite securities, we are currently seeking to expand our corporate banking operations in the United States. In addition, the sophistication of financial products and management systems has been growing significantly in recent years. As a result, we are exposed to new and increasingly complex risks. Some of the activities that our subsidiaries are expected to engage in, such as derivatives and foreign currency trading, present substantial risks. In some cases, we have only limited experience with the risks related to the expanded range of these products and services. In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop or operate the necessary information systems. As a result, we may not be able to foresee the risks relating to new products and services. As we expand the geographic scope of our business, we will also be exposed to risks that are unique to particular jurisdictions or markets. Our risk management systems may prove to be inadequate and may not work in all cases or to the degree required. The substantial market, credit, compliance and regulatory risks in relation to the expanding scope of our products, services and trading activities or expanding our business beyond our traditional markets, could result in us incurring substantial losses. In addition, our efforts to offer new services and products or penetrate new markets may not succeed if product or market opportunities develop more slowly than expected, if our new services or products are not well accepted among customers, or if the profitability of opportunities is undermined by competitive pressures. For a detailed discussion of our risk management systems, see Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Credit, Market and Other Risk. Unanticipated economic changes in, and measures taken in response to such changes by, emerging market countries could result in additional losses. We are increasingly active, through a network of branches and subsidiaries, in emerging market countries, particularly countries in Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, whose economies can be volatile and susceptible to adverse changes and trends in the global financial markets. For example, a decline in the value of local currencies of these countries could negatively affect the creditworthiness of some of our borrowers in these countries. The loans we have made to borrowers and banks in these countries are often denominated in US dollars, Euro or other foreign currencies. These borrowers often do not hedge the loans to protect against fluctuations in the values of local currencies. A devaluation of the local currency would make it more difficult for a borrower earning income in that currency to pay its debts to us and other foreign lenders. In addition, some countries in which we operate may attempt to support the value of their currencies by raising domestic interest rates. If this happens, the borrowers in these countries would have to devote more of their resources to repaying their domestic obligations, which may adversely affect their ability to repay their debts to us and other foreign lenders. The limited credit availability resulting from these conditions may adversely affect economic conditions in some countries. This could cause a further deterioration of the credit quality of borrowers and banks in those countries and cause us to incur further losses. Some emerging market countries may also change their monetary or other economic policies in response to political instabilities or pressures, which are difficult to predict. As of March 31, 2010, based on the domicile of obligors, our assets in Europe, Asia and Oceania (excluding Japan), and other areas (excluding Japan and the United States) were ¥15.8 trillion, ¥8.4 trillion and ¥5.2 trillion, representing 7.9%, 4.2% and 2.6% of our total assets. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial Condition. Our business may be adversely affected by competitive pressures, which have partly increased due to regulatory changes and recent market changes in the financial industry domestically and globally. In recent years, the Japanese financial system has been undergoing significant changes and regulatory barriers to competition have been reduced. In particular, any further reform of the Japanese postal savings system, under which the Japan Post Group companies, including Japan Post Bank Co., Ltd., were established in October 2007, could substantially increase competition within the financial services industry as Japan Post Bank, with the largest deposit base and branch network in Japan, may begin to offer financial services in competition with our business operations generating fee income. In addition, there has been significant consolidation and convergence among financial institutions domestically and globally, and this trend may continue in the future and further increase competition in the market. A number of large commercial banks and other broad-based financial 14 Table of Contents services firms have merged or formed strategic alliances with, or have acquired, other financial institutions both in Japan and overseas. As a result of the strategic alliance and the joint venture companies that we formed with Morgan Stanley, we may be newly perceived as a competitor by some of the financial institutions with which we had a more cooperative relationship in the past. If we are unable to compete effectively in this more competitive and deregulated business environment, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. For a more detailed discussion of our competition in Japan, see Item 4.B. Information on the CompanyBusiness OverviewCompetitionJapan. Future changes in accounting standards and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Future developments or changes in laws, regulations, policies, standards, voluntary codes of practice and their effects are unpredictable and beyond our control. For example, Japanese and other international organizations that set accounting standards have released proposals to revise accounting standards applicable to retirement benefit obligations. For example, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan has published proposals that, if adopted, would require companies preparing their financial statements in accordance with Japanese GAAP to record as liabilities on balance sheets actuarial losses and unrecognized past service cost, which are currently not recorded as liabilities on balance sheets. The proposed changes, if adopted, could have a significant negative impact on our capital ratios since we calculate our capital ratios in accordance with Japanese banking regulations based on information derived from our financial statements prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP. For more information, see Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may not be able to maintain our capital ratios above minimum required levels, which could result in the suspension of some or all of our operations. In addition, in response to the recent instabilities in financial markets, several international organizations which set accounting standards have released proposals to revise standards on accounting for financial instruments. Accounting standards applicable to financial instruments remain subject to debate and revision by international organizations which set accounting standards. If the current accounting standards change in the future, the reported values of some of our financial instruments may need to be modified, and such modification could have a significant impact on our financial results or financial condition. For more information, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsCritical Accounting Estimates. We could also be required to incur significant expenses to comply with new standards and regulations. For example, if we adopt a new accounting system in the future, we may be required to incur significant additional costs for establishing and implementing effective internal controls, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, additional regulatory requirements could have an adverse impact on our future business and results of operations. For example, new regulations relating to the consumer lending business which became effective in June 2010 impose, among other things, stricter requirements for consumer finance companies in Japan to review the repayment capabilities of borrowers before lending, thereby limiting the amount of borrowing available to individual borrowers, which in turn may negatively affect our profitability. For more information on regulatory changes in the consumer finance industry, see Risks Related to Our BusinessBecause of our loans to consumers and our shareholdings in companies engaged in consumer lending, changes in the business or regulatory environment for consumer finance companies in Japan may further adversely affect our financial results. Transactions with counterparties in countries designated by the US Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism may lead some potential customers and investors in the United States and other countries to avoid doing business with us or investing in our shares. We, through our banking subsidiaries, engage in operations with entities in or affiliated with Iran and Syria, including transactions with entities owned or controlled by the Iranian or Syrian governments, and the banking 15 Table of Contents subsidiary has a representative office in Iran. The US Department of State has designated Iran, Syria and other countries as state sponsors of terrorism, and US law generally prohibits US persons from doing business with such countries. Our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with Iran, Syria and other countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism are conducted in compliance in all material respects with both applicable Japanese and US regulations. Our operations with entities in Iran consist primarily of loans for petroleum projects and trade financing for general commercial purposes, as well as letters of credit and foreign exchange services. Our operations relating to Syria are primarily foreign exchange services. We do not believe our operations relating to Iran and Syria are material to our business or financial condition. As of March 31, 2010, the loans outstanding to borrowers in or affiliated with Iran were approximately $48.0 million, which represented less than 0.01% of our total assets, and we did not have any loans outstanding to the financial institutions specifically listed by the US government. We did not have any loans outstanding with entities in or affiliated with Syria, including the financial institutions specifically listed by the US government. In addition, we receive deposits or hold assets on behalf of several individuals resident in Japan who are citizens of countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. We are aware of initiatives by US governmental entities and US institutional investors, such as pension funds, to adopt or consider adopting laws, regulations or policies prohibiting transactions with or investment in, or requiring divestment from, entities doing business with Iran, Syria and other countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism. It is also possible that such initiatives may result in our being unable to gain or retain entities subject to such prohibitions as customers or as investors in our shares. In addition, depending on socio-political developments, our reputation may suffer due to our association with these countries. The above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The US government has recently enacted new legislation designed to limit economic and financial transactions with Iran. This or any similar legislative developments initiated by the US government may further restrict our business operations, and our failure to comply may result in regulatory action against us. We may not be able to maintain our capital ratios above minimum required levels, which could result in the suspension of some or all of our operations. We, as a holding company, and our Japanese banking subsidiaries are required to maintain risk-weighted capital ratios above the levels specified in the capital adequacy guidelines of the Financial Services Agency of Japan. As of March 31, 2010, our total risk-adjusted capital ratio was 14.87% compared to the minimum risk-adjusted capital ratio required of 8.00%, and our Tier I capital ratio was 10.63% compared to the minimum Tier I capital ratio required of 4.00%. Our capital ratios are calculated in accordance with Japanese banking regulations based on information derived from our financial statements prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP. In addition, some of our subsidiaries are also subject to the capital adequacy rules of various foreign countries, including the United States where each of MUFG, BTMU, MUTB and UNBC is a financial holding company under the US Bank Holding Company Act. We or our banking subsidiaries may be unable to continue to satisfy the capital adequacy requirements because of:  increases in credit risk assets and expected losses we or our subsidiaries may incur due to fluctuations in our or our subsidiaries loan and securities portfolios as a result of deteriorations in the credit of our borrowers and the issuers of equity and debt securities;  increases in credit costs we or our subsidiaries may incur as we or our subsidiaries dispose of problem loans or as a result of deteriorations in the credit of our borrowers;  declines in the value of our or our subsidiaries securities portfolio;  changes in the capital ratio requirements or in the guidelines regarding the calculation of bank holding companies or banks capital ratios or changes in the regulatory capital requirements for securities firms;  a reduction in the value of our or our subsidiaries deferred tax assets; 16 Table of Contents  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates; or  other adverse developments discussed in these risk factors. In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released proposals designed to strengthen global capital and liquidity regulations. The various proposals, if adopted, could impose stricter capital requirements and new liquidity requirements on global financial institutions such as us. If the proposals, including any new proposals released thereafter, are adopted, the Japanese capital ratio framework is expected to be revised in substantial conformity with them, thereby imposing possibly more stringent requirements on Japanese financial institutions, including us. If our capital ratios fall below required levels, the Financial Services Agency of Japan could require us to take a variety of corrective actions, including withdrawal from all international operations or suspension of all or part of our business operations. In addition, if the capital ratios of our subsidiaries subject to capital adequacy rules of foreign jurisdictions fall below the required levels, the local regulators could also take action against them that may result in reputational damage or financial losses to us. For a discussion of our capital ratios and the related regulatory guidelines, see Item 4.B. Information on the CompanyBusiness OverviewSupervision and Regulation and Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Adequacy. If the goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions becomes impaired, we may be required to record impairment charges, which may adversely affect our financial results and the price of our securities. In accordance with US GAAP, we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We recorded the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired companies as goodwill. US GAAP requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The recent global financial crisis and recession led to the decline in our market capitalization and negatively affected the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. As a result, we recorded ¥893.7 billion, ¥845.8 billion and ¥0.5 billion of goodwill impairment charges for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. As of March 31, 2010, the balance of goodwill was ¥381.5 billion. We may be required to record additional impairment charges relating to goodwill in future periods if the fair value of any of our reporting units declines below the fair value of related assets net of liabilities. Any additional impairment charges will negatively affect our financial results, and the price of our securities could be adversely affected. For a detailed discussion of the goodwill recorded and our periodic testing of goodwill for impairment, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsCritical Accounting EstimatesAccounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial ConditionGoodwill. Risks Related to Owning Our Shares It may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors, corporate auditors or other management members, or to enforce against us or those persons judgments obtained in US courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws. We are a joint stock company incorporated under the laws of Japan. Almost all of our directors, corporate auditors or other management members reside outside the United States. Many of our assets and the assets of these persons are located in Japan and elsewhere outside the United States. It may not be possible, therefore, for US investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or to enforce, against us or these persons, judgments obtained in the US courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws. 17 Table of Contents We believe there is doubt as to the enforceability in Japan, in original actions or in actions brought in Japanese courts to enforce judgments of US courts, of claims predicated solely upon the US federal or state securities laws mainly because the Civil Execution Act of Japan requires Japanese courts to deny requests for the enforcement of judgments of foreign courts if foreign judgments fail to satisfy the requirements prescribed by the Civil Execution Act, including:  the jurisdiction of the foreign court be recognized under laws, regulations, treaties or conventions;  proper service of process be made on relevant defendants, or relevant defendants be given appropriate protection if such service is not received;  the judgment and proceedings of the foreign court not be repugnant to public policy as applied in Japan; and  there exist reciprocity as to the recognition by a court of the relevant foreign jurisdiction of a final judgment of a Japanese court. Judgments obtained in the US courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws may not satisfy these requirements. Risks Related to Owning Our ADSs As a holder of ADSs, you have fewer rights than a shareholder of record in our shareholder register since you must act through the depositary to exercise these rights. The rights of our shareholders under Japanese law to take actions such as voting, receiving dividends and distributions, bringing derivative actions, examining our accounting books and records and exercising appraisal rights are available only to shareholders of record. Because the depositary, through its custodian, is the record holder of the shares underlying the American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, only the depositary can exercise shareholder rights relating to the deposited shares. ADS holders, in their capacity, will not be able to directly bring a derivative action, examine our accounting books and records and exercise appraisal rights. We have appointed The Bank of New York Mellon as depositary, and we have the authority to replace the depositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement among us, the depositary and a holder of ADSs, the depositary will make efforts to exercise voting or any other rights associated with shares underlying ADSs in accordance with the instructions given by ADS holders, and to pay to ADS holders dividends and distributions collected from us. However, the depositary can exercise reasonable discretion in carrying out the instructions or making distributions, and is not liable for failure to do so as long as it has acted in good faith. Therefore, ADS holders may not be able to exercise voting or any other rights in the manner that they had intended, or may lose some or all of the value of the dividends or the distributions. Moreover, the depositary agreement that governs the obligations of the depositary may be amended or terminated by us and the depositary without your consent, notice, or any reason. As a result, you may be prevented from having the rights in connection with the deposited shares exercised in the way you had wished or at all. ADS holders are dependent on the depositary to receive our communications. We send to the depositary all of our communications to ADS holders, including annual reports, notices and voting materials, in Japanese. ADS holders may not receive all of our communications with shareholders of record in our shareholder register in the same manner or on an equal basis. In addition, ADS holders may not be able to exercise their rights as ADS holders due to delays in the depositary transmitting our shareholder communications to ADS holders. For a detailed discussion of the rights of ADS holders and the terms of the deposit agreement, see Item 10.B. Additional InformationMemorandum and Articles of Association. 18 Table of Contents
