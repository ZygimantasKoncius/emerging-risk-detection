BUSINESS General EXCO Resources, Inc., a Texas corporation incorporated in October 1955, is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development and exploitation of onshore North American oil and natural gas properties. Our operations are focused in key North American oil and natural gas areas including Appalachia, East Texas, Mid-Continent, Permian and the Rockies. As of December 31, 2005, our Proved Reserves were approximately 444.6 Bcfe, of which 91% were natural gas and 80% were Proved Developed Reserves. As of December 31, 2005, the related PV-10 of our Proved Reserves was $1.4 billion, and the Standardized Measure of our Proved Reserves was $930.3 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we produced 23.6 Bcfe of oil and natural gas, which translates to a Reserve Life of approximately 18.8 years. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2005, we generated $202.9 million of oil and natural gas revenues. On February 14, 2006, as more fully described below, we acquired TXOK Acquisition, Inc., or TXOK. Our pro forma Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2005, including those of TXOK are 668.3 Bcfe with a PV-10 of Proved Reserves of $2.3 billion and a Standardized Measure of Proved Reserves of $1.6 billion. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this annual report to "EXCO," "we," "us," and "our" are to EXCO Resources, Inc., or EXCO Resources, its consolidated subsidiaries and EXCO Holdings Inc., or EXCO Holdings, our former parent company, which was acquired by and into which EXCO Holdings II, Inc., or Holdings II, merged in October 2005. On February 14, 2006, EXCO Holdings merged with and into EXCO Resources. Financial information presented in this annual report includes three separate periods of accounting. Information related to the period beginning January 1, 2003 to July 28, 2003 is referred to as public predecessor and represents the accounting period prior to our going private transaction. For more information about our going private transaction, see "Significant transactions during 2003 and 2004." The period beginning July 29, 2003 to December 31, 2003, the year ended December 31, 2004 and the period beginning January 1, 2005 to October 2, 2005 is referred to as the private predecessor. The private predecessor period represents the accounting period following the going private transaction up to the Equity Buyout. For more information about the Equity Buyout, see "Significant transactions during 2005 and 2006." The period beginning October 3, 2005 and ending December 31, 2005 is referred to as successor. All reserve and other non-financial operating data described as being presented on a pro forma basis excludes data relating to our former Canadian subsidiary, Addison Energy Inc., or Addison, that we sold in February 2005, but includes data relating to ONEOK Energy Resources Company and ONEOK Energy Resources Holdings, L.L.C., collectively ONEOK Energy, acquired in September 2005 by TXOK, which became our wholly-owned subsidiary on February 14, 2006. For a description of these and other significant events involving EXCO, see "Significant transactions during 2005 and 2006." We have provided definitions for some of the oil and natural gas industry terms used in this annual report in the "Glossary of selected oil and natural gas terms" beginning on page 24. Our business strategy We plan to achieve reserve, production, and cash flow growth by executing our strategy as highlighted below: Exploit our multi-year, development inventory We have a multi-year inventory of development drilling locations and exploitation projects. This inventory consists of step-out drilling, infill drilling, workovers, and recompletions. From 1 January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005, we have drilled 226 wells and completed 217 wells resulting in a 96% drilling success rate. We have identified over 2,000 drilling locations and exploitation projects across our properties on a pro forma basis. Seek acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives We maintain a disciplined acquisition process to seek and acquire properties that have established production histories and value enhancement potential through development drilling and exploitation projects. Our January 2004 acquisition of North Coast in the Appalachian Basin and the acquisition of TXOK in the East Texas and the Mid-Continent areas are examples of this strategy. Actively manage our portfolio and associated costs We regularly review our properties to identify cost savings opportunities and divestiture candidates. We actively seek to dispose of properties with higher operating costs and properties that are not within our core geographic operating areas. We also seek to opportunistically divest properties in areas in which acquisitions and investment economics no longer meet our objectives, most notably evidenced by the sale of our Canadian operations for $443.3 million in February 2005. Maintain financial flexibility We employ the use of debt along with a comprehensive commodity price risk management program to support our acquisition strategy. This approach enhances our ability to execute our business plan over the entire commodity price cycle, protect our returns on investment, and manage our capital structure. Our strengths We have a number of strengths that we believe will help us successfully execute our strategy. Experienced management team with significant employee ownership Our management team has led both public and private oil and natural gas companies over the past 20 years and has an average of over 26 years of industry experience in acquiring, developing, and exploiting oil and natural gas properties. Our management team first purchased a significant ownership interest in us in December 1997, and since then we have achieved substantial growth in reserves and production. Since the beginning of 1998, we have increased our Proved Reserves from 4.7 Bcfe to 668.3 Bcfe on a pro forma basis, and our average daily production increased from less than 1 Mmcfe per day in 1997 to 117.1 Mmcfe per day in December 2005, on a pro forma basis. Importantly, as of March 15, 2006, our management team and employees (excluding our outside directors) own approximately 12.4% of our fully-diluted capital stock, which aligns their objectives with those of our shareholders. High quality asset base in attractive regions We own and plan to maintain a geographically diversified reserve base. Our principal operations are in the Appalachia, East Texas, Mid-Continent, Permian, and Rockies areas. Our properties are generally characterized by: long reserve lives; a multi-year inventory of development drilling and exploitation projects; high drilling success rates; and a high natural gas concentration. 2 Operational control We operate a significant portion of our properties, which permits us to manage our operating costs and better control capital expenditures as well as the timing of development and exploitation activities. As of December 31, 2005, we were the operator of wells which represented 88% of our pro forma Proved Reserves. Significant transactions during 2003 and 2004 Going private transaction. On July 29, 2003, EXCO Resources consummated a going private transaction pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of EXCO Holdings. Prior to July 29, 2003, EXCO Resources had registered equity securities that were publicly traded on the NASDAQ National Market. Prior to the going private transaction, EXCO Holdings had no assets, liabilities or operations other than those nominal to its formation. Accordingly, EXCO Resources was deemed the predecessor entity to EXCO Holdings through July 28, 2003. North Coast acquisition. On January 27, 2004, we acquired North Coast Energy, Inc. (North Coast) for a purchase price of $225.1 million, including the assumption of $57.1 million of North Coast's outstanding indebtedness. As a result, North Coast became one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and continues to be an energy company focused on the acquisition, exploitation, development and production of natural gas reserves in the Appalachian Basin. The North Coast acquisition established a new core operating area for us in the Appalachian Basin, which positioned us to benefit from the attractive qualities of the basin and to capitalize on consolidation opportunities in the area. On January 20, 2004, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of our 71/4% senior notes, or senior notes, due January 15, 2011 pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, at a price of 100% of the principal amount. Approximately $168.3 million of the proceeds of the issuance of the senior notes was used to finance the acquisition of outstanding common stock, options and warrants of North Coast along with associated fees and expenses. Of the remaining proceeds, $113.8 million was used to repay a portion of our debt under our U.S. credit agreement, North Coast's credit facility indebtedness and accrued interest and fees, $50.1 million was used to repay in full principal and interest on our senior term loan, approximately $10.6 million was used to pay fees and costs associated with the offering, with the remainder, approximately $7.2 million, available for general working capital purposes. On April 13, 2004, we issued an additional $100.0 million principal amount of our senior notes pursuant to Rule 144A at a price of 103.25% of the principal amount having the same terms and governed by the same indenture as the senior notes issued on January 20, 2004. Of the total proceeds of $103.3 million, approximately $98.8 million was used to repay substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness under our Canadian credit agreement, approximately $1.2 million was used for fees and expenses associated with the offering, with the remainder, approximately $3.3 million, available for general working capital purposes. Significant transactions during 2005 and 2006 Sale of Addison. On February 10, 2005, we sold Addison, our former wholly-owned subsidiary through which all of our Canadian operations were conducted, for an aggregate purchase price of Cdn. $551.3 million ($443.3 million). Of this amount, Cdn. $90.1 million ($72.1 million) was used to repay in full all outstanding balances under Addison's credit facility, while Cdn. $56.2 million ($45.2 million) was withheld and was remitted to the Canadian government for estimated income taxes resulting from the sale of the stock. Prior to the sale of Addison, on February 9, 2005, Addison made an earnings and profits dividend (as calculated under U.S. tax law) to us in an amount of Cdn. $74.5 million ($59.6 million). The dividend was subject to Canadian tax withholding of Cdn. $3.7 million 3 ($3.0 million). See "Note 3. Sale of Addison Energy Inc." of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. TXOK acquisition. On September 16, 2005, Holdings II formed TXOK for the purpose of acquiring ONEOK Energy. Prior to TXOK's acquisition of ONEOK Energy, we owned all of the issued and outstanding common stock of TXOK and BP EXCO Holdings LP, an entity controlled by Mr. Boone Pickens, one of our directors, held all of the outstanding shares of TXOK preferred stock. On September 27, 2005, TXOK completed the acquisition of ONEOK Energy for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $642.9 million, or $634.8 million after contractual adjustments. Effective upon closing, ONEOK Energy Resources Company and ONEOK Energy Resources Holdings, L.L.C. became wholly-owned subsidiaries of TXOK. We purchased an additional $20.0 million of common stock of TXOK on October 7, 2005, which investment represented an 11% equity interest and a 10% voting interest in TXOK. The preferred stock of TXOK held by BP EXCO Holdings LP represented the remaining 89% equity interest and 90% voting interest of TXOK. TXOK funded the acquisition of ONEOK Energy with (i) $20.0 million in private debt financing, $15.0 million of which was provided by Mr. Boone Pickens, one of our directors, which has since been repaid; (ii) the issuance of $150.0 million of the 15% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of TXOK, or the TXOK preferred stock, to BP EXCO Holdings LP, an entity controlled by Mr. Pickens; (iii) approximately $308.8 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of TXOK, or the TXOK credit facility; and (iv) $200.0 million of borrowings under the second lien term loan facility of TXOK, or the TXOK term loan. On February 14, 2006, we redeemed all of the outstanding TXOK preferred stock, which represented 90% of the voting rights of TXOK. The redemption price for the TXOK preferred stock was (a) cash in the amount of approximately $163.4 million and (b) 388,889 shares of common stock of EXCO Resources. Once the TXOK preferred stock was redeemed, our acquisition of TXOK, or the TXOK acquisition, was complete and it became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The properties TXOK acquired in the TXOK acquisition included 1,057 gross (453.1 net) producing oil and natural gas wells in Texas and Oklahoma at December 31, 2005. TXOK has Proved Reserves, estimated as of December 31, 2005, of approximately 223.7 Bcfe of oil and natural gas, and 151 miles of natural gas gathering lines. The acquired properties produced an average of 970 Bbls of oil per day and 46.9 Mmcf of natural gas per day during 2005. For more information about the TXOK acquisition, see "Item 13. Certain relationships and related transactionsTXOK acquisition." Equity Buyout. On October 3, 2005, Holdings II, an entity formed by our management, purchased 100% of the outstanding equity securities of EXCO Holdings in an equity buyout, or Equity Buyout, for an aggregate price of approximately $699.3 million, resulting in a change of control and a new basis of accounting. To fund the Equity Buyout, Holdings II raised $350.0 million in interim debt financing, including $0.7 million for working capital, from a group of lenders and $183.1 million of equity financing from new institutional and other investors as well as stockholders of EXCO Holdings. In addition, current management and other stockholders of EXCO Holdings exchanged $166.9 million of their EXCO Holdings common stock for Holdings II common stock. EXCO Holdings' majority stockholder sold all of its EXCO Holdings common stock for cash. Promptly following the completion of the Equity Buyout, Holdings II merged with and into EXCO Holdings. As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of Holdings II common stock was cancelled and exchanged for one share of EXCO Holdings common stock and all shares of EXCO Holdings common stock held by Holdings II were cancelled. For more information about the Equity Buyout, see "Item 13. Certain relationships and related transactionsEquity Buyout." Following completion of the Equity Buyout, Stephen F. Smith became our Vice Chairman, President and Secretary and Harold L. Hickey became our Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. See "Item 10. Directors and executive officers of the registrant." 4 Repurchase of senior notes pursuant to a change of control tender offer. In connection with the Equity Buyout, we were required to offer to repurchase our senior notes for a purchase price of 101%. As a result, we repurchased $5.3 million principal amount of senior notes on December 13, 2005. Initial public offering. On February 14, 2006, EXCO Resources completed its initial public offering, or IPO, of 50,000,000 shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds to EXCO Resources of $617.5 million after underwriters' discount. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as joint book running managers for the IPO. The net proceeds from the IPO, together with cash on hand and additional borrowings under EXCO's credit agreement, were used as follows: $359.8 million to repay $350.0 million in principal plus accrued and unpaid interest under the interim bank loan incurred in connection with the Equity Buyout; $163.4 million to fund the redemption of the $150.0 million of TXOK preferred stock, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends and redemption premium, issued to a related party in connection with the acquisition of ONEOK Energy; $375.5 million to repay $171.8 million in principal plus accrued and unpaid interest of $0.9 million under the TXOK credit facility ($137.0 remained outstanding under this facility following the IPO) and $200.0 million in principal plus accrued and unpaid interest of $2.8 million under the TXOK term loan, both loans having been incurred in connection with the acquisition of ONEOK Energy; and $4.4 million to pay fees and expenses in connection with the IPO. Concurrent with the consummation of the IPO, including the redemption of the TXOK preferred stock, EXCO Holdings merged with and into EXCO Resources, with EXCO Resources as the surviving corporation. The outstanding shares of EXCO Holdings common stock were cancelled as a result of the merger and such shares were exchanged for the same number of shares of EXCO Resources common stock. As a result of the merger, TXOK became a wholly-owned subsidiary of EXCO Resources and TXOK and its subsidiaries became guarantors under the indenture governing our senior notes. EXCO Resources also became a guarantor under the TXOK credit facility and TXOK likewise became a guarantor under EXCO Resources' credit agreement. On February 21, 2006, EXCO Resources issued 3,615,200 additional shares of its common stock pursuant to an exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option for net proceeds to EXCO Resources of approximately $44.7 million. The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under EXCO Resources' credit agreement. 5 Summary of geographic areas of operation The following tables set forth summary operating information attributable to our principal geographic areas of operation as of December 31, 2005 on a pro forma basis: Areas Total proved reserves (Bcfe)(1) PV-10 (in millions) (1)(2) Average December daily net production (Mmcfe/d) Reserve life (years)(8) Appalachia 281.0 $ 967.7 39.0 19.7 East Texas(3) 162.3 594.5 35.4 12.6 Mid-Continent(3) 115.2 477.4 27.0 11.7 Permian 57.9 156.0 7.5 21.2 Rockies 46.8 122.9 6.7 19.1 Other 5.1 14.8 1.5 9.3 Total 668.3 $ 2,333.3 117.1 15.6 Areas Identified drilling locations(4) Identified exploitation projects(5) Total gross acreage Total net acreage(6) Appalachia 1,089 123 664,450 626,628 East Texas(7) 260 169 56,509 31,841 Mid-Continent(7) 187 188 179,065 105,150 Permian 80 32 47,755 27,395 Rockies 53 65 56,440 29,978 Other 5 8 7,543 4,055 Total 1,674 585 1,011,762 825,047 (1)The total Proved Reserves and PV-10 of the Proved Reserves as used in this table were prepared by Lee Keeling and Associates. The Proved Reserves and PV-10 for each area were determined by our internal engineers. (2)The PV-10 data used in this table is based on December 31, 2005 NYMEX spot prices of $11.23 per Mmbtu for natural gas and $61.04 per Bbl for oil, in each case adjusted for historical differentials between NYMEX and local prices. Market prices for oil and natural gas are volatile. See "Item 1A. Risk factorsRisks relating to our business." We believe that PV-10 before income taxes, while not a financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is an important financial measure used by investors and independent oil and natural gas producers for evaluating the relative significance of oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions because the tax characteristics of comparable companies can differ materially. The total Standardized Measure for our Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2005 was $1.6 billion on a pro forma basis. The Standardized Measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes, and is calculated in accordance with SFAS 69. The amount of estimated future abandonment costs, the PV-10 of these costs and the Standardized Measure were determined by us. 6 The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2005 on a pro forma basis: (in millions) PV-10 $ 2,333.3 Future income taxes (1,703.8 ) Discount of future income taxes at 10% per annum 991.6 Standardized Measure $ 1,621.1 (3)The table above includes the following information for TXOK: Areas Total Proved Reserves (Bcfe) PV-10 (in millions) Average December daily net production (Mmcfe/d) Reserve Life (years)(8) East Texas 127.2 $ 481.3 26.2 13.3 Mid-Continent 96.5 427.3 25.0 10.6 Total 223.7 $ 908.6 51.2 12.0 (4)Identified drilling locations represent total gross drilling locations identified and scheduled by our management as an estimation of our multi-year drilling activities on existing acreage. Of the total locations shown in the table, 756 are classified as proved. Our actual drilling activities may change depending on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and other factors. See "Item 1A. Risk factorsRisks relating to our business." (5)Identified exploitation projects represent total gross exploitation projects, such as workovers, recompletions, and other non-drilling activities, identified and scheduled by our management as an estimation of our multi-year exploitation projects on existing acreage. Of the total exploitation projects shown in the table, 284 are classified as proved. Our actual exploitation projects may change depending on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, and other factors. See "Item 1A. Risk factorsRisks relating to our business." (6)Includes 33,529, 38,411 and 46,629 net acres with leases expiring in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. (7)The table above includes the following information for TXOK: Areas Identified drilling locations Identified exploitation projects Total gross acreage Total net acreage East Texas 173 166 48,292 25,230 Mid-Continent 178 160 135,204 79,766 Total 351 326 183,496 104,996 (8)For purposes of this table, the reserve life is calculated by dividing the Proved Reserves (on a Mmcfe basis) at the end of the period by the daily production volumes for the month then ended, which production volume is annualized by multiplying by 365. 7 Our development and exploitation project areas Appalachia The Appalachian Basin includes portions of the states of Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee, and covers an area of over 185,000 square miles. It is the most mature oil and natural gas producing region in the United States, first establishing oil production in 1859. The Appalachian Basin is strategically located near high energy demand areas with limited supply. As a result, the natural gas from the area typically commands a higher well head price relative to other North American areas. Although the Appalachian Basin has sedimentary formations indicating the potential for deposits of oil and natural gas reserves up to depths of 30,000 feet or more, most production in this area has been derived from relatively shallow, low porosity and permeability sand and shale formations at depths of 1,000 to 6,000 feet. Operations in the area are generally characterized by long reserve lives, high drilling success rates and a large number of low productivity wells in these shallow formations. In the Appalachian Basin, there are more than 200,000 producing wells and 3,100 operators, with most being relatively small, private enterprises. Our operations in the area primarily include development drilling on our existing acreage, as well as the acquisition of properties with established production and growth opportunities. We believe that the number of wells and operators presents a significant consolidation opportunity. Central Pennsylvania Area The Central Pennsylvania Area stretches across six counties in central Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 74.6 Bcfe and 852 gross producing wells. We operate 100% of our Proved Reserves in this area. Production is primarily from the Upper Devonian, Venango, Bradford, and Elk formations at depths from 1,800 to 4,600 feet. We currently plan to drill 84 wells during 2006. Ravenswood Area The Ravenswood Area is located in the western portion of West Virginia. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 46.7 Bcfe and 587 gross producing wells. We operate 98% of our Proved Reserves in this area. Production in the Ravenswood area is primarily from the Mississippian and Devonian formations at depths of 2,500 to 4,400 feet. We currently plan to drill eight wells during 2006. Maben Area The Maben Area is located in southwest West Virginia. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 34.5 Bcfe and 316 gross producing wells. We operate 100% of our Proved Reserves in this area. In Maben, we produce from the Mississippian and Devonian formations at depths ranging from 1,500 to 5,500 feet. Our drilling activity targets seven separate shallow formations, with a typical well completed in two or more horizons. We currently plan to drill six wells during 2006. Adamsville Area The Adamsville Area is located in south central Ohio. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 11.6 Bcfe and 342 gross producing wells. We operate 99% of our Proved Reserves in this area. Adamsville produces from the Clinton reservoir and the Knox series at depths from 3,000 to 6,300 feet. We currently plan to drill five wells during 2006. Jamestown Area The Jamestown Area is located in western Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 17.3 Bcfe. We operate 123 gross producing wells which represent 100% of our Proved Reserves in the area. Production is primarily from the Medina Sandstone formation at depths of 4,500 to 5,100 feet. We currently plan to drill 31 wells during 2006. 8 East Texas The East Texas area is a part of the Cotton Valley Sand trend, which covers parts of the East Texas Basin and the Northern Louisiana Salt Basin. The TXOK acquisition significantly enhanced our position in this area. We are targeting tight sand reservoirs along the Cotton Valley Sand trend at depths of 6,500 to 12,000 feet. Operations in the area are generally characterized by long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and wells with relatively high initial production rates. Due to the tight nature of the reservoirs, development programs in the area are mostly focused on infill development drilling. Many areas have been down spaced to 80-acres per well, with some areas having economically established 40 acre spacing. Cotton Valley Area Within our Cotton Valley Area, we are active in Rusk, Upshur and Gregg Counties in Texas primarily across four fieldsOak Hill, Minden, Glenwood and White Oak. At December 31, 2005 on a pro forma basis, we had Proved Reserves of 161.4 Bcfe and 467 gross producing wells. We operate 97% of our pro forma Proved Reserves in this area. We are focused on developing the Lower Cotton Valley (Taylor) and Upper Cotton Valley sands at depths of 10,400 to 11,000 feet, the Pettit Lime at depths of 7,000 to 8,500 feet and Travis Peak Sands at depths of 7,800 to 9,000 feet. Our natural gas is gathered through our own gathering lines in these fields. On a pro forma basis we currently plan to drill 44 wells during 2006. Mid-Continent Our Mid-Continent area includes parts of Oklahoma, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. The major properties in the Mid-Continent area were acquired in the TXOK acquisition and are located in the Anadarko Shelf and Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. The Mid-Continent area is characterized by stratigraphic plays with multiple, stacked pay zones and more complex geology than in our other operating areas. Similar to our other operating areas, the Mid-Continent area contains a number of fields with long production histories. We also recognize the potential for additional attractive acquisition opportunities, as this area contains a number of smaller operators seeking liquidity opportunities and some larger companies seeking to divest non-core assets. Mocane-Laverne Field Our Mocane-Laverne Field, which was acquired in the TXOK acquisition, is located in Beaver, Harper and Ellis Counties of Oklahoma. At December 31, 2005 on a pro forma basis, we had Proved Reserves of 46.3 Bcfe and we had 479 gross producing wells. We operate 77% of our pro forma Proved Reserves. At Mocane-Laverne, we are targeting eight productive formations at depths from 2,500 to 9,000 feet. On a pro forma basis we currently plan to drill 24 wells during 2006. Cement Field Our Cement Field, which was acquired in the TXOK acquisition, is located in Caddo and Grady Counties of Oklahoma. At December 31, 2005 on a pro forma basis, we had Proved Reserves of 25.5 Bcfe and we had 131 gross producing wells, all operated by others. Production in the Cement field is primarily from multi-pay Pennsylvanian formations at depths of 4,500 to 18,000 feet. On a pro forma basis we currently plan to participate in the drilling of 17 wells during 2006. Chitwood Field Our Chitwood Field, which was acquired in the TXOK acquisition, is near our Cement Field in Grady County, Oklahoma. At December 31, 2005 on a pro forma basis, we had Proved Reserves of 24.7 Bcfe and we had 50 gross producing wells. We operate 65% of our pro forma Proved Reserves. At 9 Chitwood, we are targeting four productive formations at depths of 15,000 to 17,600 feet. On a pro forma basis we currently plan to drill seven wells during 2006. Permian The Permian Basin is located in West Texas and the adjoining area of southeastern New Mexico. Though the Permian Basin is better known as a mature oil focused basin exploited with waterflood and other enhanced oil recovery techniques, our activities are focused on conventional gas properties. With the use of 3-D seismic, we are targeting prolific natural gas reservoirs with potential for multi-pay horizons. The properties are characterized by long reserve lives and low operating costs. Vinegarone Field Our Vinegarone Field is located in Val Verde County, Texas. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 29.6 Bcfe and 26 gross producing wells. We operate 99% of the Proved Reserves in the field. Production in the Vinegarone field is primarily from the Pennsylvanian Strawn formation at depths of 10,000 to 10,500 feet. We currently plan to drill three wells during 2006. Gomez Field Our Gomez Field is located in Pecos County, Texas. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 10.5 Bcfe and 12 gross producing wells, all operated by others. At Gomez, we are primarily targeting the Ellenberger, Devonian, Wolfcamp and Atoka formations at depths of from 15,000 to 22,000 feet. We currently plan to participate in the drilling of three wells during 2006. Rockies The Rockies is a well known oil and natural gas province which encompasses several oil and natural gas basins. Our activities are currently focused on the Wattenberg Field of the Denver-Julesberg Basin of northeastern Colorado. Though the Wattenberg Field has been under extensive development since the early 1970s, improvements in fracturing technology have enhanced recoveries from these tight sand reservoirs and supported continued active development of the field. Operations in the area are generally characterized by high drilling success rates and low cost wells with significant potential for refracs. Wattenberg Field The Wattenberg Field encompasses more than 1,000 square miles, between 20 and 55 miles northeast of Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2005, we had Proved Reserves of 36.3 Bcfe and 125 gross producing wells. Our activities at Wattenberg are focused on a portion of the field in which the primary productive reservoirs are in the Codell and Niobrara formations and in selected deeper "J" Sand formations. These formations cover large areas of the field and are found at depths of approximately 6,500 to 8,500 feet. We currently plan to drill 10 wells and perform exploitation operations on eight wells during 2006. Our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves The following tables summarize historical information regarding Proved Reserves at December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and historical and pro forma information at December 31, 2005 and exclude 10 information with respect to Canada as a result of the sale of Addison in February 2005.

We believe that PV-10 before income taxes, while not a financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is an important financial measure used by investors and independent oil and natural gas producers for evaluating the relative significance of oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions because the tax characteristics of comparable companies can differ materially. The Standardized Measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes, and is 11 calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 69.

The estimate of our PV-10 and Standardized Measure is based upon our estimate of future abandonment costs and the report on our Proved Reserves as prepared by Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc. Estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are projections based on engineering data and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, production and ad valorem taxes and availability of funds. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our Proved Reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot ensure that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See "Note 20. Supplemental information relating to oil and natural gas producing activitiescontinuing operations (unaudited)" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, and our Standardized Measure. Our production, prices and expenses The following tables summarize for the periods indicated, revenues (before cash settlements of derivative financial instruments), net production of oil, natural gas and NGLs sold, average sales price per unit of oil, natural gas and NGLs and costs and expenses associated with the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Revenues shown in this table do not reflect the impact of derivatives that were treated as hedges for the 209 day period from January 1, 2003 to July 28, 2003 in order to show revenues on a consistent basis for the three years presented. Oil and natural gas revenues for the 209 day period from January 1, 2003 to July 28, 2003 as shown on the consolidated statements of 12 operations have been reduced by $14.5 million for cash settlements paid on hedges. These tables exclude information with respect to Canada as a result of the sale of Addison in February 2005.

Excluding these non-recurring items, the general and administrative expense would be $0.88 per Mcfe for the 275 day period from January 1, 2005 to October 2, 2005. 14 Our interest in productive wells The following table quantifies as of the dates indicated information regarding productive wells (wells that are currently producing oil or natural gas or are capable of production), including temporarily shut-in wells. The number of total gross oil and natural gas wells excludes any multiple completions. Gross wells refers to the total number of physical wells that we hold any working interest in, regardless of our percentage interest. A net well is not a physical well, but is a concept that reflects the actual total working interests we hold in all wells. We compute the number of net wells we own by totaling the percentage interests we hold in all our gross wells. This table excludes information with respect to Canada as a result of the sale of Addison in February 2005. The information is presented on a pro forma basis.

Our drilling activities We intend to concentrate our drilling activity on lower risk, development-type properties. The number and types of wells we drill will vary depending on the amount of funds we have available for drilling, the cost of each well, the size of the fractional working interests we acquire in each well, the estimated recoverable reserves attributable to each well and accessibility to the well site. The following tables summarize our approximate gross and net interests in the wells we drilled during the periods indicated and refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the period, regardless of when drilling was initiated. These tables exclude information with respect to 15 Canada as a result of the sale of Addison in February 2005. The information for the year ended December 31, 2005 is presented on an actual basis and therefore excludes TXOK's drilling activities.

As of December 31, 2005, we owned a 100% working interest in one well being drilled in Pennsylvania, one well in Texas, two wells in Colorado and a 50% working interest in one well being drilled in West Virginia. In addition, we had 100% working interest in two wells in Texas, six wells in Pennsylvania, one well with a 50% working interest in West Virginia and one well with a 25% working interest in Tennessee in the process of being completed. As of February 28, 2006, we owned a 100% working interest in two wells being drilled in Pennsylvania, 100% working interest in one well being drilled in Ohio, and 100% working interest in one well being drilled in West Virginia. In addition, we had three 100% working interest wells being completed in Texas and one 98.7% working interest well being completed in Colorado. Our developed and undeveloped acreage Developed acreage are those acres spaced or assignable to producing wells. Undeveloped acreage are those acres that do not currently have completed wells capable of producing commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether the acreage contains Proved Reserves. The following table 16 sets forth our developed and undeveloped acreage on a pro forma basis, at December 31, 2005 and excludes Canada as a result of the sale of Addison in February 2005: Pro forma at December 31, 2005 Developed acreage Undeveloped acreage Areas Gross Net Gross Net Appalachia 349,848 329,343 314,602 297,285 East Texas(1) 51,659 29,364 4,850 2,477 Mid-Continent(1) 155,674 90,621 23,391 14,529 Permian 39,116 22,228 8,639 5,167 Rockies 42,096 23,077 14,344 6,901 Gulf Coast 6,070 3,420 1,473 635 Total 644,463 498,053 367,299 326,994 (1)The pro forma information at December 31, 2005 above includes the following information for TXOK: Developed acreage Undeveloped acreage Areas Gross Net Gross Net East Texas 44,617 23,360 3,675 1,870 Mid-Continent 117,096 69,111 18,108 10,655 Total 161,713 92,471 21,783 12,525 The primary terms of our oil and natural gas leases expire at various dates, generally ranging from one to five years. Almost all of our undeveloped acreage is "held by production," which means that these leases are active as long as we produce oil or natural gas from the acreage. Upon ceasing production, these leases will expire. In Appalachia, we have 33,360, 28,485 and 42,747 net acres with leases expiring in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Leases expiring over the next three years in the other geographic areas are immaterial. The undeveloped "held by production" acreage in many cases represents potential additional drilling opportunities through down spacing and drilling of proved undeveloped and unproved locations in the same formation(s) already producing in a given oil or natural gas field without the necessity of purchasing additional leases or producing properties. Sales of producing properties and undeveloped acreage We regularly review our properties to identify cost savings opportunities and divestiture candidates. We actively seek to dispose of properties with higher operating costs and properties that are not within our core geographic operating areas. We also seek to opportunistically divest properties in areas in which acquisitions and investment economics no longer meet our objectives, most notably evidenced by the sale of our Canadian operations for $443.3 million. During 2004, we received proceeds of $51.9 million from the sale of properties in the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received proceeds of $45.3 million from the sale of properties in the United States. Our principal customers During 2004, sales of natural gas to an industrial customer accounted for 10.6% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. For the 209 day period from January 1, 2003 to July 28, 2003, sales of oil to Plains All American, Inc. and affiliates accounted for approximately 14.0% of total revenues. Sales to 17 Western Gas Resources accounted for approximately 10.0% of total revenues for the same 209 day period. For the 156 day period from July 29, 2003 to December 31, 2003, sales to ONEOK Gas Marketing, Inc., Plains All American, Inc., and Western Gas Resources accounted for 10.0%, 13.2%, and 12.7% of total revenues, respectively. Competition The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit. We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program. Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete satisfactorily. Many large oil companies have been actively marketing some of their existing producing properties for sale to independent producers. Although we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and submit bids as part of our growth strategy, we do not have any current agreements, understandings or arrangements with respect to any material acquisition. Applicable laws and regulations U.S. regulations The availability of a ready market for oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, as well as regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control, state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit, the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels. For example, a productive natural gas well may be "shut-in" because of an over-supply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations. State and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, protect rights to produce oil and natural gas between owners in a common reservoir, control the amount of oil and natural gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment. Pipelines and gas plants also are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local agencies. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of natural gas by pipelines are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, under the Natural Gas Act, as well as under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act. Since 1985, the FERC has implemented regulations intended to increase competition within the natural gas industry by making natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has announced several important transportation-related policy statements and rule changes, including a statement of policy and final rule issued February 25, 2000, concerning alternatives to its traditional cost-of-service rate-making methodology to establish the rates interstate natural gas pipelines may charge for their services. The final rule revises FERC's pricing policy and current regulatory 18 framework to improve the efficiency of the market and further enhance competition in natural gas markets. In the event we conduct operations on federal, state or Indian oil and natural gas leases, these operations must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes, royalty and related valuation requirements, and certain of these operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, or Minerals Management Service or other appropriate federal or state agencies. The pipelines we use to gather and transport our oil and natural gas may be subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation, or DOT, under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended, or the HLPSA. The HLPSA governs the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. Where applicable, the HLPSA requires us and other pipeline operators to comply with regulations issued pursuant to HLPSA that are designed to permit access to and allow copying of records and to make certain reports available and provide information as required by the Secretary of Transportation. The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 amends the HLPSA in several important respects. The Pipeline Safety Act requires the Research and Special Programs Administration of DOT, or the RSPA, to consider environmental impacts, as well as its traditional public safety mandate, when developing pipeline safety regulations. In addition, the Pipeline Safety Act mandates the establishment by DOT of pipeline operator qualification rules requiring minimum training requirements for operators and requires that pipeline operators provide maps and records to RSPA. It also authorizes RSPA to require certain pipeline modifications as well as operational and maintenance changes. The Research and Special Program Improvements Act of 2004, or RSPIA, further amends the HLPSA, and transfers the authority of the RSPA to the newly-formed Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of DOT, or the PHMSA. In October 2005, the PHMSA proposed new regulations regarding the definition of, and safety standards for, gas gathering pipelines, which propose to establish a new risk-based approach to determine which gathering pipelines are subject to regulation, and what safety standards regulated pipelines must meet. We do not yet know whether new regulations might arise out of this rulemaking process will impose new or additional requirements on our pipelines. If so, we could incur significant expenses. U.S. federal taxation The federal government may propose tax initiatives that affect us. We are unable to determine what effect, if any, future proposals would have on product demand or our results of operations. U.S. environmental regulations The exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas, including the operation of saltwater injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, installing and operating oil and natural gas wells. Our domestic activities are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to: the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA; the Clean Water Act, or CWA; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA; the Clean Air Act, or CAA; and 19 the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA. Our domestic activities are also controlled by state regulations promulgated under comparable state statutes. We also are subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive materials that are found in our oil and natural gas operations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking certain of our activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species, can impose certain substantial liabilities for the clean-up of pollution, impose certain reporting requirements, regulate remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination and can require substantial expenditures for compliance. We cannot predict what effect future regulation or legislation, enforcement policies, and claims for damages to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations could have on our activities. Under CWA, which was amended and augmented by OPA, our release or threatened release of oil or hazardous substances into or upon waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines and wetlands and offshore areas could result in our being held responsible for: (1) the costs of removing or remediating a release; (2) administrative, civil or criminal fines or penalties; or (3) OPA specified damages, such as loss of use, and natural resource damages. The extent of our liability could be extensive depending upon the circumstances of the release. Liability can be joint and several and without regard to fault. The CWA also may impose permitting requirements for certain discharges of pollutants and requirements to develop Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans and Facility Response Plans to address potential discharges of oil into or upon waters of the United States and adjoining shorelines. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. CERCLA and comparable state statutes, also known as Superfund laws, can impose joint, several and retroactive liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on specified classes of persons for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. In practice, clean-up costs are usually allocated among various persons. These classes of persons, or so-called potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the cost of such action. Liability can arise from conditions on properties where operations are conducted and/or from conditions at third party disposal facilities where wastes from operations were sent. Although CERCLA, as amended, currently exempts petroleum (including oil, natural gas and NGLs) from the definition of hazardous substance, some similar state statutes do not provide such an exemption. We cannot assure you that the exemption will be preserved in any future amendments of the act. Such amendments could have a significant impact on our costs or operations. Additionally, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA and similar state statutes at a future date. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. To our knowledge, neither we nor our predecessors have been designated as a PRP by the EPA under CERCLA. We also do not know of any prior owners or operators of our properties that are named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such properties. Certain states have comparable statutes. In the event contamination is discovered at a site on which we are or have been an owner or operator, we could be liable for costs of investigation and remediation and natural resource damages. 20 RCRA and comparable state and local programs impose requirements on the management, treatment, storage and disposal of both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties we own or lease or the locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been owned or operated by third parties. We have not had control over such parties' treatment of hydrocarbons or other solid wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed or released. We also generate hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste in our routine operations. From time to time, proposals have been made that would reclassify certain oil and natural gas wastes, including wastes generated during pipeline, drilling and production operations, as "hazardous wastes" under RCRA, which would make these solid wastes subject to much more stringent handling, transportation, storage, disposal and clean-up requirements. Adoption of these proposals could have a significant impact on our operating costs. While state laws vary on this issue, state initiatives to further regulate oil and natural gas wastes could have a similar impact on our operations. Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution. Federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction. Smaller sources may qualify for exemption from permit requirement of existing authorizations such as permits by rule or general permits. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed requirements including additional permits. Federal and state laws designed to control hazardous (toxic) air pollutants might require installation of additional controls. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could bring lawsuits for civil penalties or require us to forgo construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources. Oil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at the majority of our properties by previous owners and operators. Materials from these operations remain on some of the properties and in some instances may require remediation. In some instances, we have agreed to indemnify the sellers of producing properties from whom we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with the properties. We do not believe the costs to be incurred by us for compliance and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will be material, but we cannot guarantee that result. If in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations surface spills and leaks occur, including casing leaks of oil or other materials, we may incur penalties and costs for waste handling, remediation and third party actions for damages. Moreover, we are only able to directly control the operations of the wells that we operate. Notwithstanding our lack of control over wells owned by us but operated by others, the failure of the operator to comply with applicable environmental regulations may be attributable to us and may create legal liabilities for us. There are various federal and state programs that regulate the conservation and development of coastal resources. The federal Coastal Zone Management Act was passed in 1972 to preserve and, where possible, restore the natural resources of the Nation's coastal zone. The CZMA provides for federal grants for state management programs that regulate land use, water use and coastal development. States, such as Texas, also have coastal management programs, which provide for, among other things, the coordination among local and state authorities to protect coastal resources through regulating land use, water, and coastal development. Coastal management programs also may provide for the review of state and federal agency rules and agency actions for consistency with the goals and policies of the state coastal management plan. In the event our activities trigger these programs, this review may impact agency permitting and review activities and add an additional layer of review to certain activities undertaken by us. 21 We do not anticipate that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total capital expenditures program complying with current environmental laws and regulations. As these laws and regulations are frequently changed and are subject to interpretation, our assessment regarding the cost of compliance or the extent of liability risks may change in the future. We are also unable to assure you that more stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment will not be adopted and that we will not incur material expenses in complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future. If substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities are incurred, the payment of such claims may reduce or eliminate the funds available for project investment or result in loss of our properties. Although we maintain insurance coverage we consider to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all of these risks, either because insurance is not available or because of high premiums. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability or may lose substantial portions of properties due to hazards that cannot be insured against or have not been insured against due to prohibitive premiums or for other reasons. The imposition of any of these liabilities or compliance obligations on us may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. OSHA and other regulations We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements. Title to our properties When we acquire developed properties, we conduct a title investigation. However, when we acquire undeveloped properties, as is common industry practice, we usually conduct little or no investigation of title other than a preliminary review of local mineral records. We do conduct title investigations and, in most cases, obtain a title opinion of local counsel before we begin drilling operations. We believe that the methods we utilize for investigating title prior to acquiring any property are consistent with practices customary in the oil and natural gas industry and that our practices are adequately designed to enable us to acquire good title to properties. However, some title risks cannot be avoided, despite the use of customary industry practices. Our properties are generally burdened by: customary royalty and overriding royalty interests; liens incident to operating agreements; and liens for current taxes and other burdens and minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We believe that none of these burdens either materially detract from the value of our properties or materially interfere with property used in the operation of our business. Substantially all of our properties are pledged as collateral under our credit agreement. Our employees As of December 31, 2005, we employed 314 persons of which 145 were involved in field operations and 169 were engaged in technical, office or administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. To date, we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages due to labor problems, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We also utilize the services of independent consultants on a contract basis. 22 Forward-looking statements This annual report contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the following: our future financial and operating performance and results; our business strategy; market prices; our future commodity price risk management activities; and our plans and forecasts. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. We use the words "may," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "continue," "intend," "plan," "budget" and other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of our financial condition and/or state other "forward-looking" information. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. These statements also involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or financial condition to materially differ from our expectations in this annual report, including, but not limited to: fluctuations in prices of oil and natural gas; future capital requirements and availability of financing; estimates of reserves; geological concentration of our reserves; risks associated with drilling and operating wells; discovery, acquisition, development and replacement of oil and natural gas reserves; cash flow and liquidity; timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas; availability of drilling and production equipment; marketing of oil and natural gas; developments in oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries; competition; general economic conditions; governmental regulations; receipt of amounts owed to us by purchasers of our production and counterparties to our commodity price risk management contracts; hedging decisions, including whether or not to enter into derivative financial instruments; events similar to those of September 11, 2001; actions of third party co-owners of interests in properties in which we also own an interest; and 23 fluctuations in interest rates. We believe that it is important to communicate our expectations of future performance to our investors. However, events may occur in the future that we are unable to accurately predict, or over which we have no control. When considering our forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this annual report. The risk factors noted in this annual report and other factors noted throughout this annual report provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Please see "Item 1A. Risk factors" for a discussion of certain risks of our business and an investment in our common stock. Glossary of selected oil and natural gas terms The following are abbreviations and definitions of terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and this annual report. Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in reference to oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. Bcf. One billion cubic feet of natural gas. Bcfe. One billion cubic feet equivalent calculated by converting one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. Btu. British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one pound mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Completion. The installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas, or, in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. Infill drilling. Drilling of a well between known producing wells to better exploit the reservoir. Mbbl. One thousand stock tank barrels. Mcf. One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Mcfe. One thousand cubic feet equivalent calculated by converting one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. Mmbbl. One million stock tank barrels. Mmbtu. One million British thermal units. Mmcf.

One million cubic feet equivalent per day calculated by converting one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. Mmmbtu. One billion British thermal units. NGLs. The combination of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines that when removed from natural gas become liquid under various levels of higher pressure and lower temperature. NYMEX. New York Mercantile Exchange. 24 Overriding royalty interest. An interest in an oil and/or natural gas property entitling the owner to a share of oil and natural gas production free of costs of production. Present value of estimated future net revenues or PV-10. The present value of estimated future net revenues is an estimate of future net revenues from a property at the date indicated, without giving effect to commodity price risk management activities, after deducting production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs, abandonment costs and operating expenses, but before deducting federal income taxes. The future net revenues have been discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their "present value." The present value is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of the net revenue stream and should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties. Estimates have been made using constant oil, natural gas and NGL prices and operating costs at the date indicated, at its acquisition date, or as otherwise indicated. We believe that the present value of estimated future net revenues before income taxes, while not a financial measure in accordance with GAAP, is an important financial measure used by investors and independent oil and natural gas producers for evaluating the relative significance of oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions because the tax characteristics of comparable companies can differ materially. Proved Developed Reserves. Reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as "proved developed reserves" only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved. Proved Reserves. The estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. Reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test. The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (A) that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or oil-water contacts, if any, and (B) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data. In the absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir. Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project, or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based. Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following: (A) oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves; (B) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics, or economic factors; (C) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may occur in undrilled prospects; and (D) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may be recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources. Proved Undeveloped Reserves. Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units 25 can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir. Recompletion. An operation within an existing well bore to make the well produce oil and/or gas from a different, separately producible zone other than the zone from which the well had been producing. Reserve Life. The estimated productive life, in years, of a proved reservoir based upon the economic limit of such reservoir producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities assuming certain price and cost parameters. For purposes of this annual report, reserve life is calculated by dividing the Proved Reserves (on a Mmcfe basis) at the end of the period by production volumes for the previous 12 months. Royalty interest. An interest in an oil and/or natural gas property entitling the owner to a share of oil and natural gas production free of costs of production. Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows or the Standardized Measure. Under the Standardized Measure, future cash flows are estimated by applying year-end prices, adjusted for fixed and determinable escalations, to the estimated future production of year-end Proved Reserves. Future cash inflows are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on period-end costs to determine pre-tax cash inflows. Future income taxes are computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of pre-tax cash inflows over our tax basis in the associated properties. Future net cash inflows after income taxes are discounted using a 10% annual discount rate to arrive at the Standardized Measure. 3-D seismic. Geophysical data that depict the subsurface strata in three dimensions. 3-D seismic typically provides a more detailed and accurate interpretation of the subsurface strata than 2-D, or two-dimensional, seismic. Workovers. Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. Available Information We make our filings with the SEC available on our website at www.excoresources.com. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report, including those risks identified in "Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation," describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this annual report. 26 Risks relating to our business Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which have been volatile at times, may adversely affect our revenues as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness and obtain additional capital on attractive terms. Our future financial condition, access to capital, cash flow and results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas. We are particularly dependent on prices for natural gas. As of December 31, 2005, 90% of our pro forma Proved Reserves were natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that affect the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas include: the level of domestic production; the availability of imported oil and natural gas; political and economic conditions and events in foreign oil and natural gas producing nations, including embargoes, continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage; the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; the cost and availability of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity; the cost and availability of other competitive fuels; fluctuating and seasonal demand for oil and natural gas; conservation and the extent of governmental price controls and regulation of production; weather; foreign and domestic government relations; and overall economic conditions. Our revenues and our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms depend substantially upon oil and natural gas prices. Our commodity price risk management program may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in our making cash payments. To reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into commodity price risk management arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Commodity price risk management arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances, including the following: the counterparty to the commodity price risk management contract may default on its contractual obligations to us; there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the commodity price risk management agreement and actual prices received; or 27 market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments. Our commodity price risk management activities could have the effect of reducing our revenues and the value of our common stock, and making it more difficult for us to pay dividends on our common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, we made cash settlement payments on our commodity price risk management contracts totaling $26.1 million and $85.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, a $1 increase in the average commodity price per Mcfe would have resulted in an increase in cash settlement payments for the year ended December 31, 2005 of approximately $14.4 million. As of December 31, 2005, the net unrealized loss on our commodity price risk management contracts was $134.6 million. During 2005, we terminated several of our commodity price risk management contracts upon the payment of $67.6 million to our counterparties, of which $15.0 million was related to the sale of Addison and $52.6 million was related to our U.S. production. In connection with the TXOK acquisition, we assumed additional commodity price risk management contracts that TXOK had entered into covering a significant portion of its estimated future production. We may continue to incur significant unrealized losses in the future from our commodity price risk management activities to the extent market prices continue to increase and our derivatives contracts remain in place. See "Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsOur liquidity, capital resources and capital commitmentsCommodity price risk management activities." We will face risks associated with the TXOK acquisition relating to difficulties in integrating operations, potential disruptions of operations, and related negative impact on earnings. The TXOK acquisition represents a significant increase in our reserves and production. The TXOK acquisition is the largest acquisition that we have completed to date. The Proved Reserves in the TXOK acquisition represent approximately 33.5% of our pro forma Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2005. In addition, on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2005, we added 1,057 gross (453.1 net) wells to our consolidated portfolio of wells, including approximately 525 gross operated wells, which materially increased the number of wells we currently operate. All of these factors present significant integration challenges for us. In addition to the other general acquisition risks described elsewhere in this section, the magnitude of the TXOK acquisition could strain our managerial, financial, accounting, technical, operational and administrative resources, disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards as well as our internal controls and procedures. In addition, since we will acquire only one field office in connection with the TXOK acquisition, we may be unable to open field or other offices on terms acceptable to us required to accommodate the employees we hired in connection with the TXOK acquisition. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the TXOK acquisition, all of which could negatively impact our results of operations and our ability to generate cash needed to service our debt and fund our capital program and other working capital requirements. We may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves, which would reduce our revenues and access to capital. Our success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are profitable to produce. Factors that may hinder our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves include competition, access to capital, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the number and attractiveness of properties for sale. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves, our total Proved Reserves will generally decline as a result of production. Also, our production will generally decline. In addition, if our reserves and production decline, then the amount we are able to borrow under our credit agreement 28 will also decline. We may be unable to locate additional reserves, drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves. We may not identify all risks associated with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, which may result in unexpected liabilities and costs to us. Generally, it is not feasible for us to review in detail every individual property involved in an acquisition. Our business strategy focuses on acquisitions of producing oil and natural gas properties. Any future acquisitions will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards, potential tax and ERISA liabilities, and other liabilities and other similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher-valued properties. For example, in both the North Coast and TXOK acquisitions we did not review title or production data for, or physically inspect, every well we acquired. Even a detailed review of properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well that we acquire. Potential problems, such as deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment or environmental conditions that may require significant remedial expenditures, are not necessarily observable even when we inspect a well. Any unidentified problems could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to identify problems with an acquisition, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection or indemnity against all or part of these problems. Even if a seller agrees to provide indemnity, the indemnity may not be fully enforceable and may be limited by floors and caps on such indemnity. The indemnifications we received in the North Coast and TXOK acquisitions are subject to floors and caps and do not cover all these types of risks. In addition, the entity from which we acquired North Coast is a foreign entity. As a result, we may face difficulties or incur additional expenses in enforcing a judgment obtained in a U.S. court against such entity for any breach of its obligations to provide indemnity to us. We may be unable to obtain additional financing to implement our growth strategy. The growth of our business will require substantial capital on a continuing basis. Because of our issuance of the senior notes and the pledge of substantially all of our assets as collateral under our credit agreement, it may be difficult for us in the foreseeable future to obtain debt financing on an unsecured basis or to obtain additional secured financing other than purchase money indebtedness. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may lose opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties and businesses and, therefore, unable to implement our growth strategy. We may not be successful in managing our growth, which could adversely affect our operations and net revenues. The pursuit of additional acquisitions is a key part of our strategy. We face challenges in growing our managerial, financial, accounting, technical, operational and administrative resources to keep up with the pace of the growth of our business and our significant corporate transactions such as the Equity Buyout and our IPO. For example, our rapid growth and significant transactions over the past two years have strained, and could continue to strain, our financial, tax and accounting staff. The North Coast and TXOK acquisitions substantially increased the size and scope of our business from an operational, personnel, financial reporting and accounting perspective. Our growth could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards as well as internal controls and procedures. Failure to manage our growth successfully could adversely affect our operations and net revenues through increased operating costs and revenues that do not meet our expectations, as well as adversely affect our ability to satisfy our 29 disclosure and other obligations. We may also be unable to successfully integrate acquired oil and natural gas properties into our operations or achieve desired profitability. If we are unable to successfully address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or any other control deficiencies, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure and other requirements may be adversely affected. We are not currently required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and are therefore not required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. However, in connection with the 2004 and the 2005 audits of the financial statements of EXCO Resources, we reported a material weakness in Item 9A of our annual report on Form 10-K. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Our management has concluded that as of December 31, 2005, we did not maintain effective controls over the preparation and review of the quarterly and annual tax provision and the related financial statement presentation and disclosure of income tax matters. Specifically, our controls were not adequate to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the tax provision and the deferred tax balances, including the timing and classification of recording the tax impact of an extraordinary dividend. This control deficiency resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005 and audit adjustments to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, affecting income tax expense and the deferred tax liability accounts. Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement in the aforementioned tax accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this deficiency in internal control over financial reporting is a material weakness. In 2005 and through the date of this annual report, we implemented additional controls including more stringent reviews of the quarterly tax provision, hired additional finance and accounting personnel and expanded the scope of work of the outside consulting firm that we use to review our quarterly and annual tax provision. However, in a recent evaluation carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who is also our Chief Accounting Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures continued to be ineffective as of December 31, 2005 as a result of the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2004. In connection with the preparation of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005, we reconsidered our position with respect to technical correction notices from the IRS related to the tax provision made on an extraordinary dividend received from our former wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, we restated our financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005, to reflect the tax benefit in the earlier quarter and to classify the benefit as a component of continuing rather than discontinued operations in the September 30, 2005 quarter. We also reclassified a Canadian tax benefit resulting from a tax rate change in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2004 from discontinued to continuing operations. In view of these restatements, we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our processes, procedures and controls, with continued emphasis on accounting for income taxes. In connection with their audit as of December 31, 2004, our independent registered public accounting firm made recommendations to our management concerning adding additional accounting staff and implementing an internal audit function. Deficiencies in these areas may have contributed to accounting adjustments made in our financial statements and could, in the future, contribute to 30 accounting adjustments. Accordingly, we have hired a new controller, added other finance and accounting personnel and are finalizing the implementation of an internal audit function to be conducted, under our supervision, by an outside consulting firm. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate, including to effect compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 when we are required to make an assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 for fiscal 2007. The steps we have taken and will take in the future may not remediate the material weakness. In addition, we may identify additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to comply with SEC reporting requirements and NYSE listing standards or cause our financial statements to contain material misstatements, which could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, as well as subject us to civil or criminal investigations and penalties. There are inherent limitations in all internal control systems over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. While we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC implementing these requirements, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We may encounter obstacles to marketing our oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our revenues. Our ability to market our oil and natural gas production will depend upon the availability and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and other transportation facilities. We are primarily dependent upon third parties to transport our products. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines we utilize is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs or improvements to facilities or due to space being utilized by other companies that have priority transportation agreements. We experienced production curtailments in the Appalachian Basin during 2004 and 2005 resulting from capacity restraints and short term shutdowns of certain pipelines for maintenance purposes. Our access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. These factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control. If market 31 factors dramatically change, the impact on our revenues could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas, the value of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends on our company stock. There are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact the results of our operations. Our drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. We must incur significant expenditures to identify and acquire properties and to drill and complete wells. Additionally, seismic technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. We have experienced some delays in contracting for drilling rigs and increasing costs to drill wells. All of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may not correctly evaluate reserve data or the exploitation potential of properties as we engage in our acquisition, development, and exploitation activities. Our future success will depend on the success of our acquisition, development, and exploitation activities. Our decisions to purchase, develop or otherwise exploit properties or prospects will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Our estimates regarding the increase in our reserves and production resulting from the TXOK acquisition may prove to be incorrect, which could significantly reduce our ability to generate cash needed to service our debt and fund our capital program and other working capital requirements. We cannot control the development of the properties we own but do not operate, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. As of December 31, 2005, on a pro forma basis, third parties operate wells that represent approximately 12% of our Proved Reserves. As a result, the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on those properties depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including: the timing and amount of capital expenditures; the operators' expertise and financial resources; the approval of other participants in drilling wells; and the selection of suitable technology. If drilling and development activities are not conducted on these properties or are not conducted on a timely basis, we may be unable to increase our production or offset normal production declines, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. 32 Our estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves and our financial condition. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, including many factors beyond our control. This annual report contains estimates of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and the PV-10 of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. These estimates are based upon reports of our own engineers and our independent petroleum engineers. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC as to constant oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. These estimates should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated Proved Reserves. The process of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, the estimates are inherently imprecise evaluations of reserve quantities and future net revenue. Our actual future production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil, natural gas and NGL reserves may vary substantially from those we have assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in our assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of reserves, the amount of PV-10 described in this annual report, and our financial condition. In addition, our reserves or PV-10 may be revised downward or upward, based upon production history, results of future exploitation and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors. A material decline in prices paid for our production can adversely impact the estimated volumes of our reserves. Similarly, a decline in market prices for oil or natural gas may adversely affect our PV-10. Any of these negative effects on our reserves or PV-10 may decrease the value of our common stock. We are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of: fires, explosions and blowouts; pipe failures; abnormally pressured formations; and environmental accidents such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids into the environment (including groundwater contamination). We have in the past experienced some of these events during our drilling operations. These events may result in substantial losses to us from: injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment; pollution or other environmental damage; environmental clean-up responsibilities; regulatory investigation; penalties and suspension of operations; or attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation. As is customary in our industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these losses or liabilities. Furthermore, insurance coverage 33 may not continue to be available at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. Due to cost considerations, from time to time we have declined to obtain coverage for certain drilling activities and have therefore been restricted from conducting these types of drilling activities during the period we were uninsured. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could require us to make large unbudgeted cash expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Our business exposes us to liability and extensive regulation on environmental matters, which could result in substantial expenditures. Our operations are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur material costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own activities, but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for actions by us that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent. Our business substantially depends on Douglas H. Miller, our CEO. We are substantially dependent upon the skills of Mr. Douglas H. Miller. Mr. Miller has extensive experience in acquiring, financing and restructuring oil and natural gas companies. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Miller or maintain key man insurance. The loss of the services of Mr. Miller could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We may have write-downs of our asset values, which could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth. Depending upon oil and natural gas prices in the future, we may be required to write-down the value of our oil and natural gas properties if the present value of the after-tax future cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of these properties. We have in the past experienced ceiling test writedowns with respect to our oil and natural gas properties. Future non-cash ceiling test write-downs would negatively affect our results of operations and net worth. We also test goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the book value of our reporting units, as defined, exceeds the fair value of those reporting units, an impairment charge will occur, which would negatively impact our net worth. We may experience a financial loss if any of our significant customers fail to pay us for our oil or natural gas. Our ability to collect the proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas from our customers depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which includes several significant customers. If any one or more of our significant customers fails to pay us for any reason, we could experience a material loss. In addition, in recent years, a number of energy marketing and trading companies have discontinued their marketing and trading operations, which has significantly reduced the number of potential purchasers for our oil and natural gas production. This reduction in potential customers has reduced market liquidity and, in some cases, has made it difficult for us to identify creditworthy customers. We also sell a portion of our natural gas directly to end users. We may experience a 34 material loss as a result of the failure of our customers to pay us for prior purchases of our oil or natural gas. We may experience a temporary decline in revenues if we lose one of our significant customers. For the year ended December 31, 2005, sales of natural gas to an industrial customer accounted for 10.1% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2004, one customer, Alliance Energy Services L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group, Inc., accounted for 10.6% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. In 2004, our top eight customers, including Alliance, accounted for approximately 39.2% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. The Alliance contract expired at the end of 2004. Beginning in January 1, 2005, we entered into a new agreement with Alcan Corporation and its subsidiary, Alcan Rolled Products-Ravenswood, LLC, the entity for whom Alliance had acted as purchasing agent. To the extent Alcan or any other significant customer reduces the volume of its natural gas purchases from us, we could experience a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our oil and natural gas. Competition in our industry is intense and we may be unable to compete in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and hiring experienced personnel. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit. The oil and natural gas industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant price increases. We are currently experiencing difficulties in obtaining drilling rigs and other services in certain areas as well as an increase in the cost for these services and related material and equipment. We are unable to predict how such shortages and price increases will affect our development and exploitation program. Competition has also been strong in hiring experienced personnel, particularly in the accounting and financial reporting, tax and land departments. In addition, competition is strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, oil and natural gas companies, and undeveloped leases and drilling rights. We are often outbid by competitors in our attempts to acquire properties or companies. All of these challenges could make it more difficult to execute our growth strategy and increase our costs. We agreed to indemnify 1143928 Alberta Ltd. for any breaches of the representations and warranties we made in the Addison purchase agreement. We may become liable for losses that 1143928 Alberta Ltd. incurs as a result of our breach of any of the representations and warranties we made in the Addison purchase agreement. We may not have sufficient cash available to implement our growth strategy if we are required to indemnify 1143928 Alberta Ltd. pursuant to the terms of the Addison purchase agreement. Risks relating to our indebtedness We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt. As of March 28, 2006, we had approximately $548.7 million of indebtedness, including $104.0 million of indebtedness which is subject to variable interest rates. Our total interest expense on an annual basis would be $38.3 million and would change by approximately $1.0 million for every 1% change in interest rates. 35 Our level of debt could have important consequences, including the following: it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness; we may have difficulty borrowing money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations; the amount of our interest expense may increase because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; we will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities; we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage; we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices; and our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our debt, we may be required but unable to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Further, failing to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur substantially more debt, which may intensify the risks described above, including our ability to service our indebtedness. Together with our subsidiaries, we may incur substantially more debt in the future in connection with our acquisition, development, exploitation and exploration of oil and natural gas producing properties. The restrictions in our debt agreements on our incurrence of additional indebtedness are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the risks described above could substantially increase. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our senior notes and loans under our credit agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general 36 economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our senior notes and loans under our credit agreement, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. None of these remedies may, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity. Restrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests. Our credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: dispose of assets; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock; pay dividends on our capital stock; create liens on our assets; enter into sale or leaseback transactions; enter into specified investments or acquisitions; repurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt; merge or consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries; engage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates; or pursue other corporate activities. Also, our credit agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our credit agreement and our senior notes. A default, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreement and our senior notes. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to 37 refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. Risks relating to our common stock Our stock price may fluctuate significantly. Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 9, 2006. An active trading market may not develop or be sustained. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of: actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results; changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis; announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors; conditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry; the success of our operating strategy; and the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations. Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the IPO, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock. As of March 15, 2006, we have 104,004,089 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, 53,615,200 shares are freely tradable, unless any of these shares are held by our affiliates. Many of our stockholders, including our executive officers and directors, are subject to agreements that limit their ability to sell our common stock held by them. These holders cannot sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions, for a period of at least 180 days after February 8, 2006 without the prior written approval of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., which could, in its sole discretion, elect to permit resale of shares by these holders, including their affiliates, prior to the lapse of the 180 day period. On October 3, 2005, we entered into a registration rights agreement with all of the holders of our common stock, which agreement was amended by the First Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement. A total of 50,388,889 shares of common stock is covered by this agreement. Any holder who is a party to this agreement has the right, commencing 180 days after completion of the IPO, to require us to register for resale up to one-third of its shares of common stock. All other parties to the registration rights agreement would then have the right to require us to register for resale up to one-third of their shares of common stock on the same registration statement. The same rights would exist commencing 365 days and 540 days after completion of the IPO for an additional one-third of their shares at each such anniversary. Following the IPO, these time and volume restrictions on resale registrations may be waived by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. based on its evaluation of market and other conditions. In addition, at any time that we file a registration statement registering other shares, the holders of shares subject to the registration rights agreement can require that we include their shares in 38 such registration statement, subject to certain exceptions. The filing of any resale registration statement and the sale of shares thereunder may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The equity trading markets may be volatile, which could result in losses for our shareholders. The equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. Our articles of incorporation permit us to issue preferred stock that may restrict a takeover attempt that you may favor. Our articles of incorporation permit our board to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to establish, by resolution, one or more series of preferred stock and the powers, designations, preferences and participating, optional or other special rights of each series of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued on terms that are unfavorable to the holders of our common stock, including the grant of superior voting rights, the grant of preferences in favor of preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and the designation of conversion rights that entitle holders of our preferred stock to convert their shares into our common stock on terms that are dilutive to holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock in future offerings may make a takeover or change in control of us more difficult. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. In addition, our credit agreement and indenture governing our senior notes restrict the payment of dividends. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
