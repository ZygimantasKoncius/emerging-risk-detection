Item 1A. Risk Factors The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks identified in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks relating to our business Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which have been volatile at times, may adversely affect our revenues as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness and obtain additional capital on attractive terms. Our future financial condition, access to capital, cash flow and results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas. We are particularly dependent on prices for natural gas. As of December 31, 2011, 97.1% of our Proved Reserves were natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that affect the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas include:  supply and demand for oil and natural gas and expectations regarding supply and demand;  the level of domestic production;  the availability of imported oil and natural gas;  political and economic conditions and events in foreign oil and natural gas producing nations, including embargoes, continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage; 31 Table of Contents  the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;  the cost and availability of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity;  the cost and availability of other competitive fuels;  fluctuating and seasonal demand for oil, natural gas and refined products;  concerns about global warming or other conservation initiatives and the extent of governmental price controls and regulation of production;  regional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas;  the availability of refining capacity;  technological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;  weather conditions and natural disasters;  foreign and domestic government relations; and  overall economic conditions. In the past, prices of oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. During 2011, the NYMEX price for natural gas has fluctuated from a high of $4.85 per Mmbtu to a low of $2.99 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price ranged from a high of $113.93 per Bbl to a low of $75.67 per Bbl. For the five years ended December 31, 2011, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $13.58 per Mmbtu to a low of $2.51 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price ranged from a high of $145.29 per Bbl to a low of $33.87 per Bbl. On December 31, 2011, the spot market price for natural gas at Henry Hub was $3.03 per Mmbtu, a 27.2% decrease from December 31, 2010. On December 31, 2011, the spot market price for crude oil at Cushing was $98.81 per Bbl, a 10.0% increase from December 31, 2010. For 2011, our average realized prices (before the impact of derivative financial instruments) for oil and natural gas were $91.01 per Bbl and $3.85 per Mcf compared with 2010 average realized prices of $76.18 per Bbl and $4.29 per Mcf, respectively. Our revenues, cash flow and profitability and our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms depend substantially upon oil and natural gas prices. Changes in the differential between NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price our actual oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The reference or regional index prices that we use to price our oil and natural gas sales sometimes reflects a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price we reference in our sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. There are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact the results of our operations. Our drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. We must incur significant expenditures to identify and acquire properties and to drill and complete wells. Additionally, seismic and other technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. We have experienced some delays in contracting for drilling rigs, obtaining fracture stimulation crews and materials, which result in increasing costs to drill wells. All of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Part of our strategy involves acquiring acreage and drilling in new or emerging shale resource plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are subject to more uncertainties than our drilling program in the more established shallower formations and may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. The results of our drilling in new or emerging shale resource plays, such as the Haynesville/Bossier shale and the Marcellus shale, may be more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. In addition, part of our drilling strategy to maximize recoveries from the shale resource plays involves the drilling of horizontal wells using completion techniques that have proven to be successful in other shale formations. Our experience with horizontal drilling of the Haynesville/Bossier shale and the Marcellus shale to date, as well as the industrys drilling and production history in these formations, is limited. In the past, we acquired producing oil and natural gas properties with 32 Table of Contents established production histories which generated cash flow immediately upon closing the acquisition. Since we shifted our acquisition strategy to focus on acreage acquisitions in shale areas with Haynesville/Bossier and Marcellus potential, we now invest significant capital for acreage generally without any meaningful production or immediate cash flow. We must then incur significant additional costs to drill and properly develop the acreage we acquire in these shale areas. We may use bank debt to fund these acquisitions but we do not receive credit for borrowing base purposes until the wells we drill generate production. Increased drilling in the shale formations may cause pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints that may limit our ability to sell natural gas and/or receive market prices for our natural gas. The Haynesville/Bossier shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates. If drilling in the Haynesville/Bossier shale continues to be successful, the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells, as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available. If this occurs, it will be necessary for new interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems to be built. While development in the Marcellus shale is in its early stages, the geography in the Appalachia area will present similar, if not greater, gathering system challenges. Because of the current economic climate, certain planned pipeline projects for the Haynesville/Bossier and Marcellus shale areas may not occur because the prospective owners of these pipelines may be unable to secure the necessary financing. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our natural gas to interstate pipelines. In such event, this could result in wells being shut in awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures, and our failure to continue such joint ventures or resolve any material disagreements with our partners could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations, our financial condition and our results of operations. We conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures with third parties, principally BG Group, and as a result, the continuation of such joint ventures is vital to our continued success. We may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. In many instances we depend on these third parties for elements of these arrangements that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as agreed payments of substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third party obligations or the ability of third parties to meet their obligations under these arrangements is outside our control. If these parties do not meet or satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, the performance and success of these arrangements, and their value to us, may be adversely affected. If our current or future joint venture partners are unable to meet their obligations, we may be forced to undertake the obligations ourselves and/or incur additional expenses in order to have some other party perform such obligations. In such cases we may also be required to enforce our rights, which may cause disputes among our joint venture partners and us. If any of these events occur, they may adversely impact us, our financial performance and results of operations, these joint ventures and/or our ability to enter into future joint ventures. In addition, BG Group has the right to elect to participate in all acreage and other acquisitions in defined areas of mutual interest. If they elect not to participate in a particular transaction or transactions, we would bear the entire cost of the acquisition and all development costs of the acquired properties. Such joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:  our joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;  the possibility that our joint venture partners might become insolvent or bankrupt, leaving us liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;  the possibility that we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint venture partners;  joint venture partners may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives;  disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business;  that under certain joint venture arrangements, neither joint venture partner may have the power to control the venture, and an impasse could be reached which might have a negative influence on our investment in the joint venture; and  our joint venture partners may decide to terminate their relationship with us in any joint venture company or sell their interest in any of these companies and we may be unable to replace such joint venture partner or raise the necessary financing to purchase such joint venture partners interest. 33 Table of Contents The failure to continue some of our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our joint ventures with BG Group contemplate that we will make significant capital expenditures and subject us to certain legal and financial terms that could adversely affect us. On August 14, 2009, we closed two joint venture transactions with BG Group, which involved the sale of an undivided 50% interest in an area of mutual interest in certain oil and natural gas properties in East Texas and North Louisiana and a 50% interest in certain midstream operations. The upstream transaction operates as a joint venture pursuant to a joint development agreement under which EXCO acts as the operator. The midstream transaction functions as a 50-50 joint venture between EXCO and BG Group, with neither party having control over the management of, or a controlling beneficial economic interest in, the operations. On June 1, 2010, we closed our Appalachian joint venture with BG Group. Pursuant to the agreements governing the joint venture, EXCO and BG Group agreed to jointly explore and develop their Appalachian properties, particularly the Marcellus shale. EXCO and BG Group each own a 50% interest in OPCO which operates the properties, subject to oversight from a management board having equal representation from EXCO and BG Group. In addition, certain midstream assets owned by EXCO were transferred to a newly formed, jointly owned entity, Appalachia Midstream, LLC, through which EXCO and BG Group will pursue the construction and expansion of gathering systems, pipeline systems and treating facilities for anticipated future production from the Marcellus shale. Each of these joint ventures may require us to make significant capital expenditures. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments under the respective joint venture agreements, our rights to participate in such joint ventures will be adversely affected and other parties to the joint ventures may have a right to acquire a share of our interest in such joint ventures proportionate to, and in satisfaction of, our unmet financial obligations. EXCO has unconditionally guaranteed its subsidiaries performance of the joint venture agreements under the Appalachia joint ventures. Our use of derivative financial instruments is subject to risks that our counterparties may default on their contractual obligations to us and may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in us making cash payments. To reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, derivative financial instrument arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Our derivative financial instruments are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment. The change in the fair market value of these instruments is reported as a non-cash item in our statement of operations each quarter, which typically results in significant variability in our net income. Derivative financial instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances, including the following:  the counterparty to the derivative financial instrument contract may default on its contractual obligations to us;  there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative financial instrument agreement and actual prices received; or  market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments. Our use of derivative financial instruments could have the effect of reducing our revenues and the value of our securities. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we received cash payments to settle our derivative financial instrument contracts totaling $135.4 million and $217.5 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, a $1.00 increase in the average commodity price per Mcfe would have resulted in an increase in cash settlement payments (or a decrease in settlements received) of approximately $107.7 million. As of December 31, 2011, the net unrealized gains on our oil and natural gas derivative financial instrument contracts were $173.2 million. The ultimate settlement amount of these unrealized derivative financial instrument contracts is dependent on future commodity prices. In connection with acquisitions which included producing properties, we have, in certain instances, assumed derivative financial instruments covering a significant portion of estimated future production. We may incur significant unrealized losses in the future from our use of derivative financial instruments to the extent market prices increase and our derivatives contracts remain in place. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOur results of operationsDerivative financial instruments. 34 Table of Contents We have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness to fund our acquisitions, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt. As of December 31, 2011, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of approximately $300.0 million from our consolidated debt of approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily due to borrowings to fund our drilling programs and complete acquisitions (see Item 1. BusinessSignificant 2011 activities). Reimbursements from BG Group and the $125.0 million distribution from TGGT partially offset these borrowings. While we believe our consolidated debt is manageable, our reserves, borrowing base, production and cash flows can be negatively impacted by the declines in natural gas prices. At current natural gas prices, we expect that our borrowing base will likely be decreased at the next regularly scheduled re-determination date. In addition, our ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX, as defined in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, is computed using a trailing twelve-month computation. As a result, our ability to maintain compliance with this covenant may be negatively affected when oil and/or natural gas prices decline for an extended period of time. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our operating cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. These remedies may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the 2018 Notes, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity. We may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves, which would reduce our revenues and access to capital. Our success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are profitable to produce. Factors that may hinder our ability to acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves include competition, access to capital, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the number and attractiveness of properties for sale. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves, our total Proved Reserves will generally decline as a result of production. Also, our production will generally decline. In addition, if our reserves and production decline, then the amount we are able to borrow under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement will also decline. We may be unable to locate additional reserves, drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves. Development and exploration drilling and strategic acquisitions are the main methods of replacing reserves. However, development and exploration drilling operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Our future oil and natural gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected. We may not identify all risks associated with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, and any indemnifications we receive from sellers may be insufficient to protect us from such risks, which may result in unexpected liabilities and costs to us. Generally, it is not feasible for us to review in detail every individual property involved in an acquisition. Our business strategy focuses on acquisitions of producing oil and natural gas properties. Any future acquisitions will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards and liabilities, potential tax and Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, liabilities, and other liabilities and other similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher-valued properties. Even a detailed review of properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well that we acquire. Potential problems, such as deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment or environmental conditions that may require significant remedial expenditures, are not necessarily observable even when we inspect a well. Any unidentified problems could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to identify problems with an acquisition, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection or indemnity against all or part of these problems. Even if a seller agrees to provide indemnity, the indemnity may not be fully enforceable and may be limited by floors and caps on such indemnity. We may be unable to obtain additional financing to implement our growth strategy. The growth of our business will require substantial capital on a continuing basis. Due to the amount of debt we have incurred, it may be difficult for us in the foreseeable future to obtain additional debt financing or to obtain additional secured financing other than purchase money indebtedness. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms and conditions or at all, we may lose opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties and businesses and, therefore, be unable to implement our growth strategy. 35 Table of Contents We may encounter obstacles to marketing our oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our revenues. Our ability to market our oil and natural gas production will depend upon the availability and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and other transportation facilities. We are primarily dependent upon third parties to transport our products. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines we utilize is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs, outages caused by accidents or other events, or improvements to facilities or due to space being utilized by other companies that have priority transportation agreements. We experienced production curtailments in East Texas/North Louisiana resulting from capacity restraints, offsetting fracturing stimulation operations and short term shutdowns of certain pipelines for maintenance purposes. As we have increased our knowledge of the Haynesville/Bossier reservoirs, we have begun to shut in production on adjacent wells when conducting completion operations. Due to the high production capabilities of these wells, these volumes can be significant. In addition, an incident at a TGGT treating facility in May 2011 has resulted in the curtailment of volumes at that facility. We expect this facility to become operational during the first quarter of 2012. Our access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. These factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control. If market factors dramatically change, the impact on our revenues could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas, the value of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. We may not correctly evaluate reserve data or the exploitation potential of properties as we engage in our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities. Our future success will depend on the success of our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit properties or prospects will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations, which could significantly reduce our ability to generate cash needed to service our debt and fund our capital program and other working capital requirements. We cannot control the development of the properties we own but do not operate, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, third parties operate wells that represent approximately 3.8% of our proved developed producing reserves. As a result, the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on those properties depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:  the timing and amount of capital expenditures;  the operators expertise and financial resources;  the approval of other participants in drilling wells; and  the selection of suitable technology. If drilling and development activities are not conducted on these properties or are not conducted on a timely basis, we may be unable to increase our production, offset normal production declines or may lose production leases due to non-production, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. Our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves, our financial condition and the value of our common stock. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the PV-10 and Standardized Measure of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon reports of our independent petroleum engineers. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. These estimates should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated Proved Reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, the estimates are inherently imprecise evaluations of reserve quantities and future net revenue. Our actual future production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those we have assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in our assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our financial condition. In addition, our reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure may be revised downward or upward, based upon production history, results of future exploitation and development activities, prevailing oil and 36 Table of Contents natural gas prices and other factors. A material decline in prices paid for our production can adversely impact the estimated volumes and values of our reserves. Similarly, a decline in market prices for oil or natural gas may adversely affect our PV-10 and Standardized Measure. Any of these negative effects on our reserves or PV-10 and Standardized Measure may decrease the value of our common stock. We are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:  fires, explosions and blowouts;  pipe failures;  abnormally pressured formations; and  environmental accidents such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids into the environment (including groundwater contamination). We have in the past experienced some of these events during our drilling, production and midstream operations. These events may result in substantial losses to us from:  injury or loss of life;  severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;  pollution or other environmental damage;  environmental clean-up responsibilities;  regulatory investigation;  penalties and suspension of operations; or  attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation. As is customary in our industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these potential losses or liabilities. Furthermore, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. Due to cost considerations, from time to time we have declined to obtain coverage for certain drilling activities. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could require us to make large unbudgeted cash expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. We currently carry general liability insurance and excess liability insurance with a combined annual limit of $101 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. These insurance policies contain maximum policy limits and deductibles ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 that must be met prior to recovery, and are subject to customary exclusions and limitations. Our general liability insurance covers us and our subsidiaries for third-party claims and liabilities arising out of lease operations and related activities. The excess liability insurance is in addition to, and is triggered if, the general liability insurance per occurrence limit is reached. We also maintain control of well insurance and pollution insurance. Our control of well insurance has per occurrence and combined single limits ranging from $3 million to $30 million and is subject to a $500,000 deductible per occurrence. Our pollution insurance has a per occurrence and aggregate annual limit of $30 million and is subject to a $25,000 deductible per occurrence. We require our third-party contractors to sign master service agreements in which they generally agree to indemnify us for the injury and death of the service providers employees as well as contractors and subcontractors that are hired by the service provider. Similarly, we agree to indemnify our third-party contractors against claims made by our employees and our other contractors. Additionally, each party generally is responsible for damage to its own property. Our third-party contractors that perform hydraulic fracturing operations for us sign master service agreements containing the indemnification provisions noted above. We do not currently have any insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. We believe that our general liability, excess liability and pollution insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. However, these policies may not cover fines, penalties or costs and expenses related to government-mandated environmental clean-up responsibilities. 37 Table of Contents We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations. Our oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, production and sale of, oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see Item 1. Business, Applicable laws and regulations for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us. Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. President Obamas proposed Fiscal Year 2011, Fiscal Year 2012 and Fiscal Year 2013 Budgets included proposed legislation that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the manufacturing deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. The EPAs implementation of climate change regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our oil and natural gas production. Although federal legislation regarding the control of emissions of greenhouse gases or GHGs, for the present, appears unlikely, the EPA has been implementing regulatory measures under existing CAA authority and some of those regulations may affect our operations. GHGs are certain gases, including carbon dioxide, a product of the combustion of natural gas, and methane, a primary component of natural gas, that may be contributing to the warming of the Earths atmosphere, resulting in climatic changes. These GHG regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our oil and natural gas production. On June 3, 2010, the EPA published its so-called GHG tailoring rule that will phase in federal prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permit requirements for new sources and modifications, and Title V operating permits for all sources, that have the potential to emit specific quantities of GHGs. Those permitting provisions, when they become applicable to our operations, could require controls or other measures to reduce GHG emissions from new or modified sources, and we could incur additional costs to satisfy those requirements. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a rule establishing GHG reporting requirements for sources in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions, with the first annual report for 2011 being due in September 2012. Although this rule does not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, it requires us to incur costs to monitor, recordkeep and report GHG emissions associated with our operations. The adoption of derivatives legislation and regulations thereunder could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in the market and requires the CFTC, federal regulators of banks and other financial institutions and the SEC to implement the new law by promulgating regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act originally required most regulations to be promulgated by no later than July 16, 2011, but the CFTC and the SEC have both issued temporary relief to extend this deadline; in the CFTCs case, such relief has been extended through July 16, 2012, although it is possible that some regulations may be postponed or delayed further. 38 Table of Contents Under the Dodd-Frank Act and related reforms, over-the-counter derivatives dealers and other over-the-counter major market participants could be subjected to substantial regulatory supervision. The reforms expand the power of the CFTC to regulate derivatives transactions related to energy commodities, including oil and natural gas, to mandate clearance of derivatives contracts through registered derivatives clearing organizations and to impose burdensome capital and margin requirements and business conduct standards on over-the-counter derivatives transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits the CFTC to set position limits on certain derivatives instruments. On October 18, 2011, the CFTC voted to issue final regulations that implement position and trading limits on certain commodities, but include exemptions for bona fide hedging transactions. The impact of the regulations upon our business is not yet clear. Certain of our trading activities, and those of our counterparties, may be subject to the position limits, which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions. The reforms may also require us to comply with margin and clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivatives activities, although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time. Further, the reforms may also require our counterparties to spin off derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the original counterparties. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related reforms and regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The new requirements could cause hedges to become significantly more expensive (including through requirements to post collateral), uneconomic or unavailable, which could lead to increased costs, commodity price volatility, reductions in commodity prices, or any combination of the foregoing. Further, they could reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivatives contracts, subject us to additional capital or margin requirements, restrict our flexibility in conducting trading activity and taking commodity positions, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives contracts as a result of the new requirements, our results of operations may become more volatile and cash flows less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is lower commodity prices. Individually and collectively, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks and on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. Congress has considered legislation to amend the federal SDWA to remove the exemption from regulation and permitting that is applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and require reporting and disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Sponsors of bills previously introduced before the Senate and House of Representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. Such bills or similar legislation, if adopted, could increase the possibility of litigation and establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance. In addition, the EPA has recently been taking action to assert federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the SWDAs Underground Injection Control Program. Further, in March 2010, the EPA announced that it would conduct a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Interim results of the study are expected in 2012, with final results expected in 2014. In addition, in December 2011, the EPA published an unrelated draft report concluding that hydraulic fracturing caused groundwater pollution in a natural gas field in Wyoming. This study remains subject to further review and public comment. The agency also announced that one of its enforcement initiatives for 2011 to 2013 would be to focus on environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector. This study and enforcement initiative could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. Consequently, these studies and initiatives could spur further legislative or regulatory action regarding hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations. 39 Table of Contents Our business exposes us to liability and extensive regulation on environmental matters, which could result in substantial expenditures. Our operations are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur material costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own activities, but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for actions by us that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent, for example, the regulation of GHG emissions under the federal CAA, or state or regional regulatory programs. Regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, or various states in the United States in areas in which we conduct business, for example, could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Moreover, the EPA has shown a general increased scrutiny on the oil and gas industry through its GHG, CAA and SDWA regulations. Among the foregoing CAA regulations are certain newly proposed requirements as to hazardous air pollutants. Specifically, on July 28, 2011, the EPA proposed a rule to subject oil and gas operations to regulation under the NSPS and NESHAPS, programs under the CAA, and to impose new and amended requirements under both programs. Under the proposal, the EPA would, among other things, amend standards applicable to natural gas processing plants and would expand the NSPS to include all oil and gas operations, imposing requirements on those operations. The EPA is also proposing NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fracturing gas wells. The proposed standards include the reduced emission completion techniques. The NESHAPS proposal includes MACT standards for certain glycol dehydrators and storage vessels, and revises applicability provisions, alternative test protocols and the availability of the startup, shutdown and maintenance exemption. The EPA is under a court order to finalize the rules by April 3, 2012. Should these rules become final and applicable to our operations, they could result in increased operating and compliance costs, increased regulatory burdens and delays in our operations. Our business substantially depends on Douglas H. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer. We are substantially dependent upon the skills of Mr. Douglas H. Miller. Mr. Miller has extensive experience in acquiring, financing and restructuring oil and natural gas companies. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Miller or maintain key man insurance. The loss of the services of Mr. Miller could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We may have write-downs of our asset values, which could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth. We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Depending upon oil and natural gas prices in the future, and at the end of each quarterly and annual period when we are required to test the carrying value of our assets using full cost accounting rules, we may be required to write-down the value of our oil and natural gas properties if the present value of the after-tax future cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of these properties. We have in the current year and the past, including 2008, 2009 and 2011 and may in the future, experience ceiling test write-downs with respect to our oil and natural gas properties. For 2011, we recorded a non-cash ceiling test write-down of approximately $233.2 million. Future ceiling test write-downs could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth. We also test goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the book value of our reporting units exceeds the estimated fair value of those reporting units, an impairment charge will occur, which would negatively impact our results of operations and net worth. We may experience a financial loss if any of our significant customers fail to pay us for our oil or natural gas. Our ability to collect the proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas from our customers depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which includes several significant customers. If any one or more of our significant customers fails to pay us for any reason, we could experience a material loss. In addition, in recent years, it has become more difficult to maintain and grow a customer base of creditworthy customers because a number of energy marketing and trading companies have discontinued their marketing and trading operations, which has significantly reduced the number of potential purchasers for our oil and natural gas production. As a result, we may experience a material loss as a result of the failure of our customers to pay us for prior purchases of our oil or natural gas. 40 Table of Contents We may experience a decline in revenues if we lose one of our significant customers. For 2011, sales to BG Energy Merchants LLC accounted for approximately 36.0% of total consolidated revenues. BG Energy Merchants LLC is a subsidiary of BG Group. As our volumes in the Haynesville shale grow, sales to BG Energy Merchants LLC and others are expected to become more significant. The loss of any significant customer may cause a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our oil and natural gas. We have entered into significant natural gas firm transportation contracts primarily in East Texas and North Louisiana that require us to pay fixed amounts of money to the shippers regardless of quantities actually shipped. If we are unable to deliver the necessary quantities of natural gas to the shippers, our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2011, we were contractually committed to spend approximately $846.0 million over the next ten years for firm transportation services. We may enter into additional firm transportation agreements as our development of our Marcellus shale plays expands. The use of firm transportation agreements allow us priority space in a shippers pipeline which we believe is a strategic advantage. In the event we encounter delays due to construction, interruptions of operations or delays in connecting new volumes to gathering systems or pipelines for an extended period of time, the requirements to pay for quantities not delivered could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Competition in our industry is intense and we may be unable to compete in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and hiring experienced personnel. The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and headcount substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit. The oil and natural gas industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant expense/cost increases. We may experience difficulties in obtaining drilling rigs and other services in certain areas as well as an increase in the cost for these services and related material and equipment. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how such shortages and price increases will affect our development and exploitation program. Competition has also been strong in hiring experienced personnel, particularly in petroleum engineering, geoscience, accounting and financial reporting, tax and land professions. In addition, competition is strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, oil and natural gas companies, and undeveloped leases and drilling rights. We are often outbid by competitors in our attempts to acquire properties or companies. All of these challenges could make it more difficult to execute our growth strategy. If TGGT or third-party pipelines or other facilities interconnected to our gathering and transportation pipelines become unavailable to transport or process natural gas, our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected. We depend upon TGGT and third party pipelines and other facilities to provide gathering and transportation. Much of the natural gas transported by our pipelines must be treated or processed before delivery into a pipeline for natural gas. If the processing and treating plants to which we deliver natural gas were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity or other causes, our customers would be unable to deliver natural gas to end markets. For example, in the second quarter of 2011, an incident occurred at a TGGT amine treating facility in northwest Red River Parish, Louisiana resulting in an immediate shut-down of the facility. As a precautionary measure, TGGT also shut down another amine treating facility located in DeSoto Parish with similar specifications, which was restarted in October 2011. If any of such events occur or continue to occur, they could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We exist in a litigious environment. Any constituent could bring suit regarding our existing or planned operations or allege a violation of an existing contract. Any such action could delay when planned operations can actually commence or could cause a halt to existing production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could we incur significant legal and support expenses in defending our rights, but halting existing production or delaying planned operations could impact our future operations and financial condition. In addition, we are defendants in numerous cases involving claims by landowners for surface or subsurface damages arising from our operations and for claims by unleased mineral owners and royalty owners for unpaid or underpaid revenues customary in our business. We incur costs in defending these claims and from time to time must pay damages or other amounts due. Such legal disputes can also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. 41 Table of Contents Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions. As an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. While we believe we have taken the steps necessary to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to successfully address or prevent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure and other requirements may be adversely affected. Our management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 related to the ceiling test computation, which did not properly address income taxes (see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures). As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although we believe we have taken the steps necessary to remediate the material weakness and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we can give no assurances that the measures we take will remediate the material weakness that we identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate. Any material weakness or other deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure obligations or cause our financial statements to contain material misstatements, which could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. There are inherent limitations in all internal control systems over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. While we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC implementing these requirements, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of our company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Risks relating to our indebtedness We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt. As of February 22, 2012, we had approximately $1.9 billion of indebtedness, including $1.2 billion of indebtedness subject to variable interest rates and $750.0 million of indebtedness under the 2018 Notes. Our total interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, on an annual basis based on currently available interest rates would be approximately $82.3 million and would change by approximately $11.6 million for every 1% change in interest rates. Our level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:  it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the 2018 Notes, or the Indenture, and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;  we may have difficulty borrowing money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;  the amount of our interest expense may increase because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;  we will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;  we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices;  when oil and natural gas prices decline, our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants becomes more difficult and our borrowing base is subject to reductions, which may reduce or eliminate our ability to fund our operations; and  our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our debt, we may be required but unable to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all and may be required to surrender assets pursuant to the security provisions of the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. Further, failing to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur substantially more debt, which may intensify the risks described above, including our ability to service our indebtedness. Together with our subsidiaries, we may incur substantially more debt in the future in connection with our exploration, exploitation, development, acquisitions of undeveloped acreage and producing properties. The restrictions in our debt agreements on 42 Table of Contents our incurrence of additional indebtedness are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the risks described above could substantially increase. Significant additions of undeveloped acreage financed with debt may result in increased indebtedness without any corresponding increase in borrowing base, which could curtail drilling and development of this acreage or could cause us to not comply with our debt covenants. To service our indebtedness and fund our planned capital expenditure programs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes and the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and other resources in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our 2018 Notes and the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, to fund planned capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations and capital expenditure programs, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. These remedies may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity. Our borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is subject to semi-annual redeterminations. If our borrowing base were to be reduced to a level which was less than the current borrowings, we would be required to reduce our borrowings to a level sufficient to cure any deficiency. We may be required to sell assets or seek alternative debt or equity which may not be available at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, we conduct certain of our operations through our joint ventures and subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our joint ventures and subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the 2018 Notes or our other indebtedness, our joint ventures and subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the 2018 Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our joint ventures and subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each joint venture and subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our joint ventures and subsidiaries. While the Indenture and the agreements governing certain of our other existing indebtedness limit the ability of certain of our joint ventures and subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our joint ventures and subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the 2018 Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Restrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests. The EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:  dispose of assets;  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock; 43 Table of Contents  pay dividends on our capital stock;  create liens on our assets;  enter into sale or leaseback transactions;  enter into specified investments or acquisitions;  repurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;  merge or consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries;  engage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates; or  pursue other corporate activities. Also, the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness. The consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX ratio, as defined in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, is computed using a trailing twelve-month computation. When oil and/or natural gas prices decline for an extended period of time, our ability to pass this covenant becomes more difficult. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and could result in acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. An event of default under the Indenture would permit the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:  limited in how we conduct our business;  unable to raise additional debt or equity financing during general economic, business or industry downturns; or  unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lenders commitment under the credit agreement. Risks relating to our common stock Our stock price may fluctuate significantly. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE on February 9, 2006. An active trading market may not be sustained. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:  actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis;  announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;  conditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry;  the success of our operating strategy; and  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations. 44 Table of Contents Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline. As of December 31, 2011, we had 216,706,283 shares of common stock outstanding, including 2,562,409 shares of restricted stock issued to certain employees. All shares, other than restricted stock and shares held by our affiliates, are freely tradable in the public market. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock. The equity trading markets may be volatile, which could result in losses for our shareholders. The equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. Our articles of incorporation permit us to issue preferred stock that may restrict a takeover attempt that you may favor. Our articles of incorporation permit our board to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to establish by resolution one or more series of preferred stock and the powers, designations, preferences and participating, optional or other special rights of each series of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued on terms that are unfavorable to the holders of our common stock, including the grant of superior voting rights, the grant of preferences in favor of preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and the designation of conversion rights that entitle holders of our preferred stock to convert their shares into our common stock on terms that are dilutive to holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock in future offerings may make a takeover or change in control of us more difficult. We may reduce or discontinue paying our quarterly cash dividend if our board of directors determines that paying a dividend is no longer appropriate. In October 2009, we commenced a quarterly cash dividend program on shares of our common stock. Any future dividend payments will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. At any time, our board of directors may decide to reduce or discontinue paying our quarterly cash dividend. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. In addition, the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture restrict our ability to pay dividends. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
