ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued) The existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect the management or direction of the Company. These factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in management or voting control of the Company. Future issuances of our securities in connection with financing transactions or under equity incentive plans could dilute current stockholdersâ€™ ownership. We may decide to raise additional funds to fund our operations through the issuance of public or private debt or equity securities. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future issuances of debt, our common stock, other equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or other equity securities or the availability of any of the foregoing for future sale, will have on the market price of our common stock. The issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or the conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding now or in the future), or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition, further dilution to our existing stockholders will result, and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.
