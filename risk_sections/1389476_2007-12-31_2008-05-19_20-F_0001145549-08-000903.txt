D. Risk Factors  Risks related to the regulation of our business and to our structure  The dividends we receive from our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries and our global income may be subject to PRC tax under the new PRC tax law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our assets and liabilities, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. Revenue recognition Advertising sales revenues include revenues from the provision of advertisements in newspapers, magazines and billboards and are recognized when advertisements are published net of provisions for estimated rate adjustments and discounts. Payments received in advance are deferred until earned and such amounts are reported as deferred revenues included in accrued expenses and other payables of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Publishing services revenues include management and information consulting fees relating to magazine subscriptions and sales of magazines, such as Money Journal, Funds Observer and Chinese Venture. Magazine subscription revenues are recognized over the subscription period. Single copy sales of magazines through distributors or retail outlets such as newsstands, supermarkets, and convenience stores are recognized when sold to the ultimate customers. Revenues from book sales are recognized when books are sold to end customers. To date, revenue from book sales has not been significant. We do not carry book and magazine inventories on our consolidated balance sheets. Costs of books and magazines published are charged to cost of revenues when incurred. Advertising services revenues include revenues from event organization, sponsorship at events, advertising agency services, mobile value-added services, provision of market research services and provision of advisory and consulting services and are generally recognized as services are provided. Revenues from event organization, such as dramas, include ticketing revenue recognized upon the delivery of tickets and admission to the events. Revenues from sponsorship at events are generally recorded over the period of the applicable agreements commencing from the operating of the related event. Revenues from advertising agency service, provision of market research services and provision of advisory and consulting services are recognized when the services are provided. Content production revenues include revenues from producing television programs, animations, visual effects and post-production for television commercials and broadcast design. Episodic television series are produced or acquired for distribution to the television market. Revenues are recognized when the master tape of the program is available for first airing under the terms of the related licensing agreement. Broadcast design mainly includes design of television channel logos, production of trailers for advertising the television channels, and image consulting and branding for the television channels. Revenue for the production of logos and trailers are recognized upon delivery of the products and customer acceptance. Revenues for image and branding consultations are recognized as the services are provided. We record revenues net of applicable business taxes, which totaled $0.3 million for the period from May 26, 2005, the date our parent acquired our predecessor entity, EconWorld Media, to December 31 2005, and $1.9 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. 84 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, we act as an intermediary or agent in placing advertising transactions with television and radio stations with third parties. Such transactions are recorded at either gross or net basis depending on whether we act as the principal or as an agent in the transaction. We are considered the principal and record revenues on a gross basis in transactions where we purchase blocks of advertising time and attempt to sell the time to advertisers and when these transactions carry the substantial risks and rewards of ownership. We are considered an agent and record revenues on a net basis for those transactions in which we find advertising space for advertisers and when these transactions do not carry the substantial risks and rewards of ownership We extend credit based upon an evaluation of a customers financial condition. We do not require collateral from customers to which we extend credit. Allowances for estimated credit losses are generally established based on historical experience. Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets We are required to review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Should the carrying value of our goodwill or acquired intangible assets be determined to be impaired, their carrying value would be written down. To assess potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, we perform an assessment of the carrying value of our reporting units at least on an annual basis or when events and changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would perform the second step in our assessment process and record an impairment loss to earnings to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analysis and external valuations, which utilize income and market valuation approaches through the application of capitalized earnings and discounted cash flow. These valuation techniques are based on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the projected future operating results of the reporting unit, appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rates. There were no impairment losses in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. Income taxes We recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, net operating loss carryforwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Income taxes generated from our Hong Kong operations have not been material as we have not had significant operations in Hong Kong to date. For our operations based in the PRC in 2007, we were taxed at a statutory rate of 33% (30% state income tax plus 3% local income tax) applied to PRC taxable income reported in our PRC statutory financial statements. Valuation of share-based compensation We account for share-based compensation to our employees based on SFAS No. 123R and will record compensation expense based on the fair value of the options, shares and warrants on the date of grant. We incurred share-based compensation expenses of $2.4 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. 85 Table of Contents With respect to the non-vested shares granted in June 2006, we retained an independent appraiser to produce a valuation report on the fair value of our company. Significant management judgment is involved in determining the underlying variables. We concluded that $0.60 was the fair value based on managements evaluation of the report. In the third quarter of 2006, we granted share options to our employees. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase common shares to a consultant in December 2006. We used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the amount of employee share-based compensation expense for these share options and warrants. In January 2007, we issued warrants to purchase common shares to an employee. In April and September 2007, we granted share options to three and four independent directors, respectively. We used the Binomial option-pricing model to determine the amount of employee share-based compensation expense for these share options and warrants. The Black-Scholes and Binomial approaches require us to make assumptions on such variables as share price volatility, expected lives of options and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could significantly affect the amount of employee share-based compensation expense we recognize in our consolidated financial statements. See  Operating costs and expenses  Share-based compensation expenses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS No. 155). This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement (new basis) event occurring after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We adopted SFAS No. 155 in 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 addresses standardizing the measurement of fair value for companies who are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes. The FASB defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Options for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial year beginning on or after November 15, 2007. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 159. It is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of FASB ratified EITF Issue 06-11 Accounting for the Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards (EITF 06-11). EITF 06-11 provides that tax benefits associated with dividends on share-based payment awards be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact of EITF 06-11 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In 2007, the EITF of FASB issued EITF Issue 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities (EITF 07-3). EITF reached a consensus that nonrefundable advance payments to acquire goods or pay for services that will be consumed or performed in a future period in conducting research and development activities on behalf of the entity should be recorded as an asset when the advance payments are made. Capitalized amounts should be recognized as expense when the related goods are delivered or services are performed, that is, when the goods without alternative future use are acquired or the service is rendered. EITF 07-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of EITF 07-3. It is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 86 Table of Contents In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). The objective of SFAS No. 141R is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. SFAS No. 141R is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R. It is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 defines a noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The objective of SFAS No. 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 160. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS No. 161). This statement establishes enhanced disclosures about the entitys derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. Adoption of SFAS No. 161 will result in enhanced disclosure regarding our derivatives. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 161. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of the consolidated statements of operations of our company for the periods indicated. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of our company, including the related notes, that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The period from May 26, 2005 to December 31, 2005 cannot be compared to our years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 because these periods are of different lengths and because our scope of operations during these periods changed. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. Therefore, our historical consolidated results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations you may expect for any future period.

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, we had all five reportable segments. The following table lists our net revenues and operating costs and expenses by reportable segments for the periods indicated.

Holding company structure We are a holding company with no material operations of our own. We conduct our operations in the PRC primarily through our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, other affiliated entities and strategic partners in the PRC and Hong Kong. As a result, our ability to pay dividends and to finance any debt we may incur depends upon dividends paid by our subsidiaries and service fees paid by an affiliated entity, Beijing Century Media. If our current or future subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries in the PRC are permitted to pay dividends to us out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under the PRC law, each of our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in the PRC is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserves until such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital, and to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund at the discretion of each subsidiarys or affiliates board of directors or shareholders meeting. Although the statutory reserves can be used to, among other uses, increase the registered capital and 95 Table of Contents eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserves may not be distributed as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation of the companies. See Note 30 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Inflation Inflation in China has not materially impacted our results of operations in recent years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the increase of the consumer price index in China was 3.9% in 2004, 1.8% in 2005 and 1.5% in 2006 and 4.8% in 2007. Foreign Currency The exchange rate between U.S. dollar and RMB was in a decline trend, from July 2005 when the average exchange rate was 8.2264 to December 2007 when the average exchange rate was 7.3682, which resulted in foreign currency translation losses when we translated our financial assets from U.S. dollars into RMB. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated from financing activities, which consisted of funds raised in our initial public offering, bank borrowings, private placements of convertible preferred shares to, and borrowing from, Patriarch Partners, and a private placement of convertible preferred shares to Yucaipa. See Item 7.B. Major shareholders and related party transactions  Related party transactions  Transactions with Patriarch Partners and Item 7.B. Major shareholders and related party transactions  Related party transactions  Transactions with Yucaipa. As of December 31, 2007, we had $44.4 million in cash and $47.3 million in restricted cash. We do not have direct access to cash or future earnings of any of our PRC affiliated entities but can direct the use of their cash through agreements that provide us with effective control of these entities. See Item 4.C. Information on the Company  Organizational structure  Agreements that provide effective control over our affiliated entities. We require cash to fund our ongoing business needs, particularly future acquisitions. Since our incorporation on November 7, 2005, we have made a number of strategic acquisitions and expect to continue to acquire businesses that complement our existing operations. See  Overview  Acquisitions. To date, we have not encountered any difficulties in meeting our cash obligations. We believe that our current cash, anticipated cash flow from operations, and the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future, given our current growth plans. On March 31, 2006, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $38.2 million for the benefit of Xinhua Financial Network and a promissory note in the amount of $68.5 million for the benefit of our parent. See Item 7.B.

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions A. Major Shareholders Please refer to Item 6.E. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Share Ownership. B. Related Party Transactions Contractual arrangements with our affiliated entities and their shareholders PRC laws and regulations currently limit foreign equity ownership of companies that engage in media, advertising and market research businesses. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operate a substantial portion of our businesses in China through a series of contractual arrangements with our affiliated entities and their shareholders. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see Item 4.C. Information on the Company  Organizational structure  Agreements that provide effective control over our affiliated entities, Item 4.C. Information on the Company  Organizational structure  Agreements that provide the option to 111 Table of Contents purchase the equity interest in the affiliated entity and Item 4.C. Information on the Company  Organizational structure  Agreements that transfer economic benefits to us. Transactions with our parent or its subsidiaries Any transactions we entered into with our parent, its predecessor or its subsidiaries, are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below: Contracts between us and our parent or its subsidiaries On September 13, 2006, we entered into a Group Services Agreement with our parent. Under this agreement, certain services shall be provided to us in exchange for a variable charge. The services include a wide range of services including management, human resources, finance, legal, corporate communications, public relations, information technology and administrative services. The agreement expires on December 31, 2009 and is renewable for two-year terms, and may be terminated upon six months notice, upon material breach, insolvency, or if we are no longer a controlled subsidiary of our parent. The variable charges for the Group Services Agreement are based on the types of services to be performed. On January 25, 2007, the Group Services Agreement was amended to provide that charges for 2006 under the agreement would not exceed $700,000 and for subsequent years would not exceed $1.0 million. We incurred charges of $0.7 million and $0 for 2006 and 2007, respectively, under the Group Services Agreement. We have a verbal space arrangement with a subsidiary of our parent pursuant to which we share costs under a lease held by the subsidiary. We paid $0.4 million pursuant to this agreement in 2007. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. Loan agreements between us and our parent or its subsidiaries On March 31, 2006, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $38.2 million for the benefit of Xinhua Financial Network and a promissory note in the amount of $68.5 million for the benefit of our parent. Both notes were due on demand and the interest rates were not specified. We issued the promissory notes to borrow money from our parent and Xinhua Financial Network to pay for the costs related to our acquisition from our parent of equity interests our parent had held before March 31, 2006 in Xinhua Finance Advertising Limited, the contractual control our parent had held before March 31, 2006 in Beijing Century Media Culture Co., Ltd. and advances from our parent and Xinhua Financial Network enabling us to acquire 19.0% equity interests in Upper Step Holdings Limited, or Upper Step, and Accord Group Investments Limited, or Accord Group. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our parent paid on our behalf earn-out consideration related to our acquisitions of Beijing Century Media and Xinhua Finance Advertising of $7.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively, and direct costs of $0.2 million. We repaid $50.0 million in cash to our parent in 2007 and the remaining balance of $113.5 million dollars was permanently waived. We currently owe $5.3 million to our parent, which mainly comprises $4.9 million in earn-out consideration for an acquisition. On February 6, 2006, Beijing Century Media entered into a loan agreement with Xinhua Financial Network (Beijing) Limited, under which Beijing Century Media borrowed RMB3.0 million ($0.4 million) for working capital. The loan did not carry interest and did not specify a due date. This loan was fully repaid in 2007. The terms of these loans were favorable to us as we are part of the Xinhua Finance Limited group. Transactions involving our acquisitions See Item 5. Operating and financial review and prospects  Acquisitions. The terms and pricing of each acquisition, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis between the sellers and the buyers and we believe the terms are comparable to terms that could have been obtained from independent third parties. However, we received assistance from our parent and Xinhua Financial Network in executing these acquisitions and in certain instances the acquisition target was initially acquired by our parent and injected to us in exchange for certain 112 Table of Contents consideration. We received favorable terms from our parent and Xinhua Financial Network as we are part of the Xinhua Finance Limited group. Transactions with David U. Lee, Leeding Media LLC, K-Jam Media Inc. and Kia Jam In April 2008, Xinhua Media Entertainment Limited, or Xinhua Media Entertainment, and Leeding Media, LLC, or Leeding Media, entered into a services agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Leeding Media agreed to furnish to Xinhua Media Entertainment the services of David U. Lee, who now acts as the Managing Director of Xinhua Media Entertainment. Mr. Lee is the sole shareholder of Leeding Media, which is a shareholder of Xinhua Media Entertainment. The agreement has an initial term of 24 months starting from April 1, 2008, and shall continue indefinitely thereafter until terminated. The agreement may be terminated by Xinhua Media Entertainment at any time for cause, by mutual consent, by six months written notice by either party after the expiry of the initial term, or upon certain other events. David U. Lee separately warranted to Xinhua Media Entertainment that, among other things, Xinhua Media Entertainment has the rights and remedies against Mr. Lee that it otherwise would have were Mr. Lee a direct employee. In April 2008, Xinhua Media Entertainment, Leeding Media, David U. Lee, K-Jam Media Inc., Kia Jam and Xinhua Finance Media entered into a shareholders agreement pursuant to which Leeding Media agreed to introduce Xinhua Media Entertainment to business opportunities and provide the services of Mr. Lee to act as the Managing Director of Xinhua Media Entertainment. A dividend is payable to shareholders of Xinhua Media Entertainment under the agreement according to a predetermined formula. The agreement also provides for certain shareholder rights including tag-along and drag-along rights and a right of first refusal for existing shareholders to purchase additional shares in Xinhua Media Entertainment in the event of the sale of additional shares. Transactions with Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao Free Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao Free Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd., or Wai Gao Qiao, held 4.5% of the equity interest in us as of April 30, 2008 via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Honour Rise Services Limited. Wai Gao Qiao has significant influence over us due to its shareholding and our dependence on the strategic cooperation relationship between us and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Camera Media Investment Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Camera, to carry out our television broadcast operations. The transactions we entered into with Wai Gao Qiao and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Shanghai Camera, are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. In January 2007, through an entrusted loan arrangement with the Agricultural Bank of China, our affiliated entity, Shanghai Yuan Zhi Advertising Co., Ltd., loaned RMB15.5 million ($2.1 million) to Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao Free Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. to finance their working capital. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and will mature in January 2010. Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao Free Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. has, however, verbally agreed to repay this loan by the fourth quarter of 2008. Agreements regarding Shanghai Camera Media Investment Co., Ltd. See Item 4.B. Information on the Company  Business overview  Arrangements with partners and suppliers  Agreements regarding Shanghai Camera. We loaned $1.7 million to Shanghai Camera for working capital purposes in 2006 and an additional $0.3 million in 2008. The loan rolls over on a year-to-year basis and carries no interest. The maximum amount drawable under the loan is RMB30.0 million ($4.1 million). Shanghai Camera repaid $2.0 million in other loans to us in 2007. Transactions with Sino Investment Holdings A $1.5 million loan from Sino Investment Holdings to us incurred in relation to our acquisition of the Accord Group was waived in 2007. The waived amount was recorded as a shareholders contribution and included in paid-in capital. 113 Table of Contents Transactions with Patriarch Partners Patriarch Partners Media Holdings, LLC and its affiliates held 6.3% of the equity interests of our parent and 7.0% of our equity interests as of as of April 30, 2008.

No further dividends are payable on the preferred shares that were held by Patriarch Partners. Under our then Memorandum and Articles of Association, Patriarch Partners, as a holder of our convertible preferred shares, was entitled to vote on an as converted basis together with the holders of our common shares.

On September 19, 2006, we redeemed 819,672 convertible preferred shares, with a face value of $3.0 million, held by Patriarch Partners for a total consideration of $1.00. As the result of its shareholding in us and our parent and the influence over us conferred by our Memorandum and Articles of Association, Patriarch Partners has significant influence over us. The transactions we entered into with Patriarch Partners are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis, and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. Proxy agreement and amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association On July 24, 2006, Patriarch Partners consented to the amendment of our Memorandum and Articles of Association, including the creation of class B common shares held by our parent with ten votes per share. As consideration, our parent granted to Patriarch Partners an irrevocable proxy over our shares held by our parent. Under the proxy agreement, Patriarch had the exclusive right to vote (or consent) with respect to the shares held by our parent at any time after January 7, 2009. Prior to that, our parent exercised full voting power with respect to its shares, and agreed to vote to ensure that Fredy Bush remains our sole director until our initial public offering. Furthermore, our parent agreed not to sell, directly or indirectly, any of our shares that it held. This proxy agreement terminated upon the completion of our initial public offering. Share purchase agreement between us and Patriarch Partners Patriarch Partners entered into a share purchase agreement with us on March 16, 2006, agreeing to purchase 16,404,926 of our convertible preferred shares for $60.0 million. Patriarch Partners also agreed to purchase 5,468,309 additional convertible preferred shares for $20.0 million, but did not do so because we did not purchase additional assets for which the additional $20.0 million was to be raised. The purchase price was determined through our arms-length transaction with Patriarch Partners. In connection with our issuance and sale of convertible preferred shares in March 2006, we entered into an investor rights agreement and credit agreement with Patriarch Partners. Investor rights agreement among us, Patriarch Partners and our parent Pursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement dated as of March 16, 2006, we have granted Patriarch Partners and certain holders of our common shares customary registration rights, including demand and piggyback registration rights and Form F-3 registration rights. A total of 15,585,254 common shares of our company are covered by registration rights, assuming all of the outstanding preferred shares are converted, there are no accrued and unpaid dividends and the conversion price is not adjusted. The number of shares covered by registration rights may increase if Patriarch Partners owns more of our shares, for instance, if it converts the loan under the credit agreement described below into common shares. In addition, the investor rights agreement grants Patriarch Partners preemptive rights with respect to any issuance of equity securities issued by us, which provision was terminated upon the completion of our initial public offering. 114 Table of Contents In the event our parent decides to transfer some of its securities in us, it must give rights of co-sale to Patriarch Partners, so that Patriarch Partners may sell securities along with our parent in the sale.

Patriarch Partners could convert any outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest into our class A common shares at any time, at an initial conversion ratio of $3.657438 per common share, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. Pursuant to this agreement, we also entered into pledge and security agreements pledging the shares of certain of our subsidiaries and granting security over our property, including shares and intellectual property, and over the property of certain of our subsidiaries. On September 20, 2006, the credit agreement was amended to provide for additional interest in the aggregate amount of $3.0 million, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 820,246 class A common shares upon the conversion of the loan. This amendment was executed one day after the redemption of 819,672 convertible preferred shares mentioned above. All outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was converted automatically into class A common shares upon our initial public offering, and the credit agreement and pledge agreement terminated at that time.

As of June 30, 2006, we had paid $3.5 million in fees under this agreement. The agreement terminated on April 18, 2007 and we paid no fees under this agreement in 2007. Transactions with Yucaipa Share purchase agreement between us and Yucaipa Yucaipa Global Partnership Fund L.P. and its affiliates, or Yucaipa, held 6.1% of our equity interests as of March 31, 2008. Yucaipa also holds 300,000 of our series B convertible preferred shares, which were purchased for $30.0 million pursuant to a share purchase agreement entered into on February 18, 2008. The purchase price was determined through our arms-length transaction with Yucaipa. The convertible preferred shares are a newly-created series having certain preferences, limitations and relative rights. The convertible preferred shares are convertible into class A common shares at the option of holders based on a conversion formula at any time after the first anniversary of the closing of the placement on February 28, 2008, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The conversion rate at any time shall be determined by dividing an amount equal to the sum of (x) the stated value per share, which is $100.00 per convertible preferred share subject to adjustment in the event of any subdivision or combination of the outstanding preferred shares, plus (y) the amount of any accrued dividends per share then remaining unpaid on each convertible preferred share being converted by the then applicable conversion price, initially equal to $3.00 per share, but subject to adjustment. Yucaipa, as a holder of our convertible preferred shares, is entitled to vote on an as converted basis together with the holders of our common shares. Moreover, the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding convertible preferred shares is required for certain matters, such as authorizing the issuance of any parity shares, while the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding convertible preferred shares and any outstanding parity shares required for certain other matters, such as entering into certain transactions with shareholders or affiliates, or materially changing the scope of our business. The convertible preferred shares are entitled to quarterly preferred dividends at the rate of 8% per annum payable in cash or, at our option subject to certain limitations, through the issuance of additional convertible preferred shares. Upon any liquidation, the convertible preferred 115 Table of Contents shares would be entitled to a liquidation preference. The holders of the convertible preferred shares have the right to require that their shares be redeemed by the us upon the occurrence of certain events. Shareholders agreement among us, Yucaipa and our parent The shareholders agreement requires Xinhua Finance Limited, our parent and controlling shareholder, to vote its shares in us and take certain other actions to ensure that an individual designated by Yucaipa will remain one of our directors so long as Yucaipa continues to hold at least 50% of the convertible preferred shares originally issued under the share purchase agreement. The shareholders agreement also provides Yucaipa with certain tag-along rights in connection with certain sales by Xinhua Finance Limited of common shares it holds in us. Registration rights agreement between us and Yucaipa Pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated February 28, 2008, we have granted Yucaipa piggyback registration rights. A total of 10,000,000 common shares of our company are covered by registration rights, assuming all of the outstanding convertible preferred shares are converted, there are no accrued and unpaid dividends and the conversion price is not adjusted. Transactions with Hunan Television & Broadcast Intermediary Co., Ltd. Long Qiu Yun has served as our independent director since March 2007 and as a director of our subsidiary, Beijing Perspective Orient Movie Television Intermediary Co., Ltd., or Beijing Perspective, since July 2006. Mr. Long also has served as the board chairman and general manager of Hunan Television & Broadcast Intermediary Co., Ltd., or Hunan Television, since 1995. In July 2006, we acquired 51% of the equity of Beijing Perspective from Hunan Television through Beijing Century Media, an affiliated entity. Xinhua Financial Network financed the purchase price for this acquisition. In October, 2007, we acquired, through Beijing Century Media, the remaining 49% of the equity of Beijing Perspective for RMB16.0 million ($2.2 million). In connection with the acquisition of the remaining 49% equity interest in Beijing Perspective, we entered into a share subscription agreement and deed of non-competition undertaking and release with Whole Fortune Limited, or Whole Fortune, a limited liability company controlled by Hunan Television and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Pursuant to these agreements, we issued 2,043,347 class A common shares to Whole Fortune in exchange for its entering into a non-competition agreement with us. Under the non-competition agreement, Whole Fortune promised that it and its affiliates will not compete with us or our affiliates outside of China for a term of four years. The common shares we issued to Whole Fortune were valued at $4.06 per share and had an aggregate value of $8.3 million. The terms of this non-competition agreement, including the price paid by us, when taken as a whole with the acquisition of 49% of the equity interest in Beijing Perspective by Beijing Century Media, were determined on an arms length basis, and we believe the terms are comparable to terms we could obtain from independent third parties. See Item 5. Operating and financial review and prospects  Acquisitions. Share restructuring On September 22, 2006, we issued 4,099,968 warrants and 6,478,437 class A common shares and our parent paid $9.1 million to Sino Investment Holdings Limited, or Sino Investment, the 37.0% shareholder of our subsidiary Upper Step, and the 61.0% shareholder of Accord Group, another subsidiary of ours, in exchange for its shareholdings in Upper Step, and 451,107 class A common shares in exchange for its shareholdings in Accord Group.

Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Information A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information We have appended consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report. Legal Proceedings We are subject to a class action complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for alleged violations of U.S. federal securities laws. The lawsuit asserts claims against us, our CEO Fredy Bush, our former CFO Shelly Singhal and other defendants for allegedly failing to disclose in our initial public offering registration statement and prospectus certain background information concerning Shelly Singhal. The alleged undisclosed information consists of lawsuits and proceedings that were brought against other entities with which Shelly Singhal was associated and that are completely unrelated to us. We and other defendants have filed motions to dismiss the class action complaint. We believe that the allegations in the class action are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the claims. The outcome of the class action, like other litigation proceedings, is uncertain. Regardless of its merit, litigation and other preparations undertaken to defend the class action can be costly, and we may incur substantial costs and expenses in doing so. It may also divert the attention of our management. If the class action against us is successful, it may result in substantial monetary liabilities, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We are currently not a party to any other material legal proceeding. From time to time, we may be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict with certainty the results of such litigation, we believe that the final outcome of any pending litigation arising in the ordinary course of business will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, however, any litigation can result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources and attention. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common shares, nor do we have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ADSs in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. We have, however, paid dividends to the holder of our convertible preferred shares of approximately $7.5 million and $1.3 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively. We discontinued these dividends upon conversion of the convertible preferred shares. As we are a holding company, we rely on dividends paid to us by our wholly-owned subsidiaries Upper Step Holdings Limited, Accord Group Investments Limited, Xinhua Finance Advertising Limited, Xinhua Finance Media (Convey) Limited, Profitown Development Limited and East Alliance Limited, all of which are British Virgin Islands business companies, by our wholly-owned subsidiaries EconWorld Media Limited and Singshine (Holdings) Hongkong Ltd, both Hong Kong companies, by our subsidiary Small World Television Limited in which we hold a 70% interest, a Hong Kong company, and by our subsidiary Xinhua Media Entertainment in which we hold a 75% interest, a Cayman Islands company, for our cash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses. 117 Table of Contents In the British Virgin Islands, the payment of dividends is subject to limitations. A British Virgin Islands business company that prior to January 1, 2007 existed as an international business company is permitted to declare and pay dividends only out of surplus, meaning the excess, if any, at the time of the determination, of the total assets of the company over the sum of its total liabilities, as shown in the books of account, plus its capital. In addition, such company may not declare or pay a dividend unless the directors of the company determine that immediately after the payment of the dividend the company will be able to satisfy its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of its business and the realizable value of the assets of the company will not be less than the sum of its total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as shown in the books of account, and its capital. In Hong Kong, the payment of dividends is also subject to limitations. Dividends may only be distributed out of accumulated, realized profits less accumulated, realized losses. Accumulated, realized profits must not have been previously distributed or capitalized. Accumulated, realized losses do not include those previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. In the Cayman Islands, the payment of dividends is also subject to limitations. Dividends may only be distributed out of profits, or out of a companys share premium account, subject to the company being able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to pay dividends, subject to the approval of our shareholders. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. Cash dividends on our ADSs, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars. B.
