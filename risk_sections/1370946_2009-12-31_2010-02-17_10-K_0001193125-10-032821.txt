ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)  provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, amend or repeal our bylaws except in limited circumstances; and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. Additionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder and which may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. We may pay little or no dividends on our common stock. The payment of any future dividends to our stockholders will depend on decisions that will be made by our Board of Directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our operating results, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, corporate law restrictions, capital agreements, applicable laws of the State of Delaware and business prospects. We may pay little or no dividends for the foreseeable future. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Owens Corning has nothing to report under this Item. Table of Contents -15-
