ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE EXPECTED REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS SO THAT THE LOSS OF OR REDUCTIONS IN PURCHASES BY ANY ONE ULTIMATE CUSTOMER COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND LEAD TO LOSSES. During the fiscal year 2010 and each of the previous two fiscal years, we derived, on average, 68% of our revenues from seven programs. Due to the lengthy sales cycles, we believe that existing programs, with perhaps the addition of a few other programs, will be the basis for a majority of our revenues in the near-term. The loss of or reductions in purchases by any one of our largest customers due to program cutbacks, competition, or other reasons could mat erially reduce our revenue base. Annual or quarterly losses have occurred when there are material reductions, gaps or delays in card orders from our largest U.S. or foreign government programs or if such programs were to be reduced in scope, delayed, canceled, or not extended and not replaced by other card orders or other sources of income. Revenues from the following major programs are shown below accounting for 10% or greater of our total revenues: 2010 2009 2008 United States Green Cards 27 % 14 % 17 % Angola National ID Card program 18 % <10 % - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia National ID Card program 13 % 26 % 23 % Other programs (each less than 10%): Foreign Resident ID Card program in Costa Rica Vehicle registration card programs in India Various card programs in Italy WE INCURRED NET LOSSES DURING THREE OF THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE IN THE FUTURE TO OBTAIN PROFITABILITY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. In the past five years, only fiscal years 2006 and 2010 generated net income. There can be no assurance that we will generate enough revenues in the near term to attain annual profitability. We are relying principally upon our OSM technology to generate future product revenues, earnings and cash flows. If alternative technologies emerge or if we are otherwise unable to compete, we may not be able to sustain profitability. OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS PROVIDE FOR AN INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES. We typically receive purchase orders where customers have the right to delay or cancel at any time. We have no long-term firm order commitments from any of our largest customers. Therefore delays in orders, contract cancellations or changes in technology decisions could result in decreased revenues and operating losses. Our revenue is predominantly dependent on the receipt of purchase orders on a recurring basis. Since we do not have contracts with firm commitments for deliveries over an extended period of time our revenue and earnings are subject to volatility. OUR OSM CARD PRODUCT REVENUES WILL NOT GROW IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN REVENUE FROM EXISTING PROGRAMS AND WIN NEW BUSINESS. There can be no assurance that revenue levels on existing programs will be maintained or that we will receive sizable orders for new programs, nor any assurance that we will be able to win any other new business which is necessary to grow or maintain our business to the level we desire. SINCE THE SALES CYCLE FOR OUR SECURE ID PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY LONG AND UNPREDICTABLE, WE HAVE DIFFICULTY PREDICTING WHEN NEW BUSINESS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO REVENUE GROWTH. Because our customers for secure ID credentials are large government entities, obtaining substantial orders usually involves a lengthy sales cycle, requiring marketing and technical time and often times significant expense with no guarantee that substantial orders will result. This long sales cycle results in uncertainties in predicting operating results, particularly on a quarterly basis. In addition, the equipment supply and consulting work we undertake on occasion for the set up of card manufacturing facilities involves substantial time from start to finish, with the potential for obstacles to intervene outside our control, such as delays in the construction and readying of facilities and site by the customer and the potential for our customer to request changed specifications for the facility’s throughput, so there can be substantial lags between when we sign a contract and receive a deposit and when we complete a project and recognize revenue. 14 WE COULD EXPERIENCE EQUIPMENT, RAW MATERIAL, QUALITY CONTROL, OR OTHER PRODUCTION PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY IN PERIODS OF INCREASING VOLUME. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our projected card manufacturing capacity if and when customer orders grow significantly. We have made and may continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand our card manufacturing capacity depending upon projected volume. However, since customer demand is difficult to predict, and we generally wait for such demand to materialize prior to making capital expenditure commitments, we may be unable to ramp up our production quickly enough to fill new customer orders in a timely fashion . This could cause us to lose new business and possibly existing business. In addition, if we overestimate customer demand, we could incur significant costs from creating excess capacity, such as was the case during fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The addition of fixed overhead costs increases our breakeven point and results in lower gross margins unless compensated for by increased product sales. When purchasing raw materials for our anticipated card demand, we take into consideration the order-to-delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such raw materials. If we over-estimate customer demand, excess raw material inventory and inventory write-offs can result. We may experience manufacturing complications associated with increasing our manufacturing capacity. We may also experience difficulties implementing new manufacturing processes, meeting customers’ quality or international standards requirements, or outsourcing some of our manufacturing. WE ARE OUR OWN SOLE SOURCE OF OSM CARDS AND SEVERAL OF THE STEPS IN OUR CARD MANUFACTURING PROCESS HAVE NO BUILT-IN REDUNDANCY. THEREFORE, WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS, INCLUDING IF CERTAIN MACHINERY WERE TO BREAK DOWN. MUCH OF OUR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT IS COMPRISED OF CUSTOM VERSIONS OF MACHINERY, SOME OF WHICH IS MORE THAN 20 YEARS OLD. IN ADDITION, WE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING OR NOT OBTAINING CERTAIN PROGRAMS SHOULD THEY REQUIRE A SECOND SOURCE. We use a proprietary manufacturing process with custom machinery and several of the steps in our card manufacturing process have no built-in redundancy, or in some cases, have only the redundancy located in Germany. We are susceptible to supply interruptions when our line goes down and when our line malfunctions. Much of our machinery is comprised of customized versions of machinery that has long lead times to replace and may be difficult to maintain or repair, requiring us to be self-reliant. Some of the machinery we use is more than 20 years old and is no longer produced by its manufacturer, which would require us to adapt a newer version to our needs if this machinery broke down and could not be repaired, which would involve additional delay, effort and expense. If current or potential customers require a second source for their card programs (which is a common business practice) they could decide to use one of our competitors that may have multiple sources of supply. This would harm our business and financial results. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO BUY RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON TIME, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN REVENUES. Most of the raw materials used in the manufacture of cards are available from one or more qualified suppliers. Such materials include plastic film used in card production, which are available from multiple suppliers. Processing chemicals, inks and bonding adhesives are also obtained from various suppliers. We often order significant quantities of raw materials to prepare for expected demand. If the demand does not materialize as expected, raw material inventory supplies will grow as it takes longer to consume in production sized for actual sales volume. It is possible that this could lead to high levels of obsolescence and inventory write-downs if product designs change or demand decreases. Also, certain photographic films used in OSM cards are commercially available solely from Eastman Kodak Company (“Kodak”) of the United States. No assurance can be given that Kodak will continue to supply such photographic film on a satisfactory basis and in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements. If Kodak were to discontinue manufacturing the film from which our OSM is made, we would endeavor to establish an alternate supplier for such film, although the purchase price could increase and reliability and quality could decrease with a new supplier. No assurance can be given that we will have adequate demand to attract a second source. In addition, an alternate supplier could encounter technical issues in producing the film, as there may be know-how and manufac turing expertise which Kodak has developed over the years which an alternate supplier may have difficulty replicating. If Kodak announced that it would no longer offer film, we would request that Kodak provide us with a last-buy opportunity which we would plan to take maximum advantage of, although no assurance can be given that Kodak would provide us with such an opportunity. There can be no assurance that we would be able to procure an alternate source of supply of this film on reasonable terms or at all, which could force us to design new cards using different materials. This could be very disruptive to our business, result in increased costs and lower quality products, and cause us to lose sales. We are also researching other materials besides film for use as OSM. Even if developed or procured, there can be no assurance that other materials could be used as a replacement for Kodak film in our current product or be cost-ef fective. In addition, semiconductor modules available from multiple sources could become scarce in periods of high industry demand. All raw materials and components are subject to supply and demand limitations. 15 THE VOLATILITY IN THE COST OF PETROLEUM CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING INCOME AND GROSS MARGIN IF THIS RESULTS IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTION MATERIALS SUCH AS THE POLYCARBONATE-BASED PRODUCTS. The polycarbonate raw material used for our cards is petroleum based. The volatility in the cost of petroleum could impact our costs for such raw material and also lead to higher energy bills for running our manufacturing facilities. Long-term increases in petroleum prices could lead to a decline in our gross margins and income unless we are able to adjust our selling prices. AN INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF READ/WRITE DRIVE PARTS OR DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN READ/WRITE DRIVE ASSEMBLY COULD CAUSE A DELAY IN DELIVERIES OF DRIVES AND OSM CARDS AND A POSSIBLE LOSS OF SALES, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. Several major components of our read/write drive are designed specifically for our products. For example, the optical recording head for the current drive is a part obtained from one supplier and at current production volumes; it is not economical to have more than one supplier for this custom component. While we carry a large inventory of safety stock for this item, any delays in or inability to obtain parts from this supplier coul d cause us to lose revenues while we source a second supplier. The ability to produce read/write drives in high-volume, if required, will be dependent upon maintaining or developing sources of supply for components that meet our requirements for high volume, quality, and cost. In addition, we could encounter quality control or other production problems at high-volume production of read/write drives. Any of this could cause us to lose OSM card sales as well as sales of our drives. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE SECURE ID CARD INDUSTRY AND IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY GENERALLY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR FUTURE BUSINESS. The secure ID technology industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing product evolution. The future success and growth of our business will require us to maintain and enhance the technological capabilities of the LaserCard product line. There can be no assurance that our products currently being sold or under development will remain competitive or provide sustained revenue growth. SEVERAL OF OUR PROGRAMS INVOLVE OUR CARDS AS PART OF A SOLUTION WHICH INCLUDES TECHNOLOGIES OF THIRD PARTIES. DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY THESE THIRD PARTIES COULD CAUSE OUR ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS, GENERALLY GOVERNMENTS, TO FIND FAULT IN OSM CARDS AND SWITCH TO OTHER SOLUTIONS EVEN IF OUR OSM TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THE ROOT CAUSE OF ANY FAULT. In certain of our current programs various third-party technologies such as contact or contactless chips are added to our cards. The embedding or addition of other technologies to the LaserCard OSM card, especially when contracted to independent third parties, could potentially lead to technical, compatibility and other issues. In such circumstances, it may be difficult to determine whether a fault originated with our technology or that of a co-supplier or with the person embedding or adding the third party technology to our cards. If such faults occur, they could be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to resolve. Such difficulties could lead to our ultimate customers, the foreign governments, switching to other technologies even if OSM technology is not the root cause of the fault(s). The resulting loss of customers would adversely affect our revenues. WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF CARD PROGRAMS AND THEIR METHOD OF IMPLEMENTATION MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL DUE TO QUALITY OR COST. We mainly sell to VARs and system integrators who in turn sell solutions to the end customer. The system integrators may not follow the recommendations we provide for the handling, processing, and printing of our cards or for working with the end-user in the card issuing process. This could lead to low quality, high costs, or both, resulting in damage to our reputation, the LaserCard name and loss of the contract. In order to mitigate this risk, we work to train the integrators to avoid such situations but cannot contr ol their work and may not always be successful in our training. We plan to continue to offer this support and then transition the card issuing process to local resources once the program is running successfully. There can be no assurance that issues with our systems integrators in the future will not damage our reputation, the LaserCard name, reduce our revenues, or cause us to lose various governmental programs. 16 OUR OSM CARDS HAVE A COMPLEX STRUCTURE THAT REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO MEET INCREASINGLY STRINGENT PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE AGREE TO CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED IN INDEPENDENTLY PUBLISHED STANDARDS. THIS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF MANUFACTURING CARDS OR RESULT IN ACCEPTING RETURNS OR GIVING CREDITS TO THE CUSTOMER IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS. MANY CUSTOMERS MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE INVENTORY WHICH INCREASES THIS RISK. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet customers’ quality or standards requirements consistently. This could lead to high manufacturing costs due to low product yields or unexpected product returns. We employ a rigorous quality control p rocedure, are ISO 9001:2000 certified, and strive to deliver products that meet published standards and customer expectations. Even so, we cannot give assurance that our products will meet customer expectations in all cases. We have in the past, and we may in the future, replace products held by customers or give credit for products previously delivered. Any failure to meet our customers’ standards may harm our reputation, result in product returns and inventory write downs, and may cause us to lose sales and customers. IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE OUR TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH COULD WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, REDUCE REVENUES, OR INCREASE COSTS. We use a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may n ot protect proprietary rights as fully as U.S. law. Any patents we may obtain may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around any of our issued patents or other intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful. Litigation, or the threat of litigation, may also cause us to have to license third-party technology, which would increase our costs and harm our margins, or to discontinue the sale of certain products. We cannot predict whether the expiration or invalidation of our patents would result in the introduction of competitive products that would affect our future revenues adversely. THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE COMPETITIVE, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, REVENUES COULD DECLINE OR FAIL TO GROW. Our OSM cards may compete with OSM cards that can be manufactured and sold by three of our licensees (although none is currently doing so) and with other types of portable data storage technologies applied to ID cards. These may include RF enabled chip and RFID tags. Financial, personnel and marketing resources of some of the competing companies are significantly greater than our resources. Competitive product factors include system/card portability, interoperability, price-performance ratio of cards and associated equipment, durability, environmental tolerance, and card security. Although we believe our cards offer key technological and security advantages for certain applications, the current price of read/write drives could be a competitive disadvantage in some of our targeted markets. Nevertheless, we believe the cost of ownership of an optical card system is competitive in applications requiring large populations of cards because of the relatively high overall cost to implement a system based on our major competition, IC cards. THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY. The price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility, which may be due to fluctuations in revenues, earnings, liquidity, press coverage, analyst recommendations, financial market interest, trading volume, and stock market conditions, as well as changes in technology and customer demand and preferences. As a result, our stock price might be low at the time a stockholder wants to sell the stock. For example, during fiscal year 2010 our stock price fluctuated from a high of $9.84 per share to a low of $2.48 per share. Also, since we have a relatively low number of shares outstanding (approximately 12 mi llion shares) there will be more volatility in our stock if one or two major holders, for example, large institutional holders, attempt to sell a large number of shares in the open market. Furthermore, our trading volume is often small, meaning that a few trades may have disproportionate influence on our stock price. In addition, someone seeking to liquidate a sizeable position in our stock may have difficulty doing so except over an extended period or privately at a discount. Thus, if one or more stockholders were to sell or attempt to sell a large number of its shares within a short period of time, such sale or attempt could cause our stock price to decline. There can be no guarantee that stockholders will be able to sell the shares that they acquired at a price per share equal to or greater than the price they paid for the stock. 17 WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. Part of the manufacturing process of certain of our products takes place in our operations in Germany. Also, some of the raw materials we use to manufacture OSM cards are sourced in Europe. These costs are denominated in Euros, the currency used in much of Europe. However, when we sell our finished products, the prices that we charge are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure when the exchange rate for Euros increases in relation to the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, particularly against Euro, generally sales and net income will be positively impacted. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business, particularly against Euro, generally sales and net income will be negatively impacted. As of March 31, 2010, we had not entered into a forward exchange contract or other hedging transaction to hedge against or potentially minimize the foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions other than those related to intercompany transactions. The losses on foreign currency exchange related to purchase and intercompany transactions for these periods were immaterial, but we have no assurance that such losses will not be significant in the future. WE HAVE INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CASH IN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (“ARSs”), WHICH BECAME ILLIQUID IN FEBRUARY 2008. WE COULD RECORD FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS DECLINES FURTHER. As of March 31, 2010, we held $11.9 million par value of marketable securities consisting of ARSs that we classified as current investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Previously, UBS offered and we accepted a “Rights” offering whereby UBS offered to purchase certain ARSs it placed, including those we hold, at par or face value. Also included in our short-term investment is the Put Option received in this rights offering from UBS recognized as a benefit with a fair value of approximately $0.8 million. There is no assurance that the fair value will continue to equal the PAR value in the future. UBS has the “Right” to purchase its ARSs at par at any time through July 3, 2012 and we have the “Right” to sell our ARSs at par to UBS at any time from June 30, 2010 through July 3, 2012. We intend to exercise our Put Option and sell our ARSs to UBS on June 30, 2010. As of March 31, 2010, we had borrowed $7.9 million from UBS under a credit line collateralized by the ARSs. We recognized a net loss of $0.3 million related to the fair values of the ARSs and the Put Option during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and a gain of a like amount during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. FUTURE TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH WE MAY BECOME A PARTY, INCLUDING STOCK ISSUANCES AND CERTAIN SHAREHOLDER STOCK TRANSACTIONS, MAY JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO USE SOME OR ALL OF OUR NOLS. Based on current tax law, we believe we had NOLs sufficient for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes to offset future taxable income in the amount of $10.9 million as of March 31, 2010. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we undergo an ownership change. An ownership change occurs for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if, among other things, stockholders who own or have owned, dire ctly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock (with certain groups of less-than-5% stockholders treated as a single stockholder for this purpose) increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our common stock by more than fifty percentage points above the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the relevant three-year testing period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation, based upon the value of the company at the time of the ownership change, on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOLs. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs. To the extent that these NOLs become significantly limited, we expect to be taxed on our income, if any, at the U.S. federal and state statutory rates. As a result, any inability to utilize these NOLs would adversely affect on our financial condition. In addition, the inability to use NOLs could harm the value at which we might be acquired by a third-party and would adversely affect our financial condition relative to our financial condition had the NOLs been available. In addition, California and certain states have suspended the use of NOLs, and other states are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. 18 IN MARCH 2004, WE SOLD A CARD MANUFACTURING LICENSE UNDER WHICH WE WOULD PROVIDE CERTAIN FACTORY SET-UP AND TRAINING SERVICES IN SLOVENIA TO GLOBAL INVESTMENT GROUP LTD. (“GIG”) IN CONJUNCTION WITH PREVENT GLOBAL OF SLOVENIA (“PREVENT GLOBAL”). NEITHER GIG NOR PREVENT GLOBAL ARE CURRENT WITH THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT. There have been certain agreements made between us and GIG in conjunction with Prevent Global regarding this contract. If certain payments are made, we would be obligated to deliver manufacturing equipment and installation support specified in the contract to GIG/Prevent Global for a card manufacturing facility in Slovenia when such facility is provided by the counterparty, to provide a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of 10 million optical cards annually. Our obligation arises under a March 2004 agreement with GIG which was assumed by Prevent Global in 2007. We have performed our obligations under the agreements and stand ready to complete the remaining obligations. However, payments due to us are in arrears and GIG has claimed that it still has rights to the agreement. We have filed a claim in the United Kingdom, the court of jurisdiction, for the determination of who between GIG and Prevent Global is the rightful counterparty to the agreements. Upon this determination, we intend to exercise our rights under the contract. It is possible that we, Prevent Global or GIG will initiate other litigation to enforce rights under the agreements. Any such litigation may be expensive to us and distracting to our management even if we ultimately prevail. In the opinion of our management, based on the review of information available at this time, the total cost of resolving this contingency at March 31, 2010 should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation. As appropriate, we will establish accruals for potential expenses or losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable if and when this occurs. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT, RETAIN OR INTEGRATE KEY PERSONNEL, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM SUCCEEDING. We may not be able to retain our key personnel or attract other qualified personnel in the future. Our success will depend upon the continued service of key management personnel. The loss of services of any of the key members of our management team, including our chief executive officer, chief operating officer, vice president of finance and chief financial officer, the managing directors of our German operations, or our vice president of marketing, or our failure to attract and retain other key personnel could disrupt operations and have a negative effect on employee productivi ty and morale, thus decreasing production and harming our financial results. In addition, the competition to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel is intense. OUR CALIFORNIA FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN AN EARTHQUAKE ZONE AND THESE OPERATIONS COULD BE INTERRUPTED IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, OR OTHER DISASTER. Our card manufacturing, corporate headquarters, and drive assembly operations, administrative, and product development activities are located near major earthquake fault lines. In the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. Likewise, fires, floods, or other events could similarly disrupt our operations and interrupt our business. FOREIGN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We sell our products worldwide and, therefore, our products must comply with various domestic and international laws, regulations and standards and our business could be subject to risks due to changes in a country’s or region’s political, regulatory or economic conditions. We may experience difficulty in securing required approvals, licenses or permits on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Differing tax laws and changes in those laws may also affect our future results of operations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or industry s tandards, or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected products to become impractical or otherwise adversely affect our ability to produce or market our products. Failure to comply with existing or new laws or regulations, including export and import restrictions and barriers, or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals, licenses or permits could result in lost sales or increased costs. DISRUPTIONS TO OUR BUSINESS OR THE BUSINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. Business disruptions, including from severe weather events (such as hurricanes, floods and blizzards), from casualty events (such as explosions, fires or material equipment breakdown), from the occurrence of a pandemic (such as the Swine Flu), from acts of terrorism or acts of war, and from other similar events, as well as any lack of government readiness and support in those countries where we do business, may cause damage or disruption to our properties, business, employees, suppliers, distributors, resellers, and customers, which could have an a dverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 19 AS A RESULT OF OUR REQUIRED ANNUAL EVALUATION OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE MAY IDENTIFY INTERNAL CONTROL WEAKNESSES NEEDING REMEDIATION, WHICH COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION. We have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. Although our assessment, testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. Because of the inherent limitation of disclosure controls, n o evaluation of such controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within LaserCard have been detected. If our internal controls are found to be ineffective in future periods, our reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations, both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income. IF WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, WE WOULD INCUR A VARIETY OF COSTS AND THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS MIGHT NEVER BE REALIZED. In recent times, we have not made any acquisitions other than Challenge Card Design and Cards & More in March 2004 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future. Future acquisitions may result in substantial dilution of our current stockholders’ percentage ownership; expenditure of our current limited cash resources; incurrence of debt, amortization of expenses related to goodwill, research and development and other intangible assets or lar ge and immediate write-offs; and assumption of liabilities. Our operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks, including assimilating employees, operations, technologies and products; unanticipated costs; diverting our management’s time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our business; entering markets in which we have no or limited direct experience; potentially losing key employees from the acquired company; and adversely effecting our existing business relationships. If we fail to adequately manage these risks, we may not achieve the intended benefit of any acquisition. WE MAY FACE RISKS FROM OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL SALES. Our LaserCard products are used in countries around the world in addition to the United States, such as Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Angola, Italy, India, Costa Rica and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. International sales accounted for approximately 72% of our revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010, 84% for the year ended March 31, 2009 and 78% for the year ended March 31, 2008. We also operate a German subsidiary. Our international operations are subject to the following risks, among others: difficulty with staffing and managing international operations; transportation and supply chain di sruptions and increased transportation expense as a result of epidemics, terrorist activity, acts of war or hostility, increased security and less developed infrastructure; political and economic uncertainty caused by changes in governments, epidemics, terrorism or acts of war or hostility; difficulties in collecting receivables and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and potentially adverse tax consequences. 20 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
