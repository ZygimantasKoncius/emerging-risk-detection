Risk Factors Risks relating to our corporate credit portfolio The largest portion of our exposure is to small- and medium-sized enterprises, and financial difficulties experienced by companies in this segment may result in a deterioration of our asset quality and have an adverse impact on us. Our loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises increased from (Won)40,198 billion, or 44.4% of our total loans, as of December 31, 2004 to (Won)68,077 billion, or 42.6% of our total loans, as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, on a Korean GAAP basis, Won-denominated loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises that were classified as substandard or below were (Won)593 billion, representing 0.9% of such loans to those enterprises. On a Korean GAAP basis, we recorded charge-offs of (Won)157 billion in respect of our Won-denominated loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises in 2007, compared to charge-offs of (Won)107 billion in 2006. The industry-wide delinquency ratios for Won-denominated loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises rose from 2002 through 2004, although these delinquency ratios stabilized in 2005 and decreased in 2006 and 2007. As of December 31, 2006, the delinquency ratio for loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises was calculated as the ratio of (1) the outstanding balance of such loans in respect of which either principal payments are overdue by one day or more or interest payments are overdue by 14 days or more (unless prior interest payments on a loan were made late on more than three occasions, in which case the loan is considered delinquent if interest payments are overdue by one day or more) to (2) the aggregate outstanding balance of such loans. From January 1, 2007, the delinquency ratio for small- and medium-sized enterprises is calculated as the 12 Table of Contents ratio of (1) the outstanding balance of such loans in respect of which either principal or interest payments are over due by one month or more to (2) the aggregate outstanding balance of such loans. Our delinquency ratio for such loans denominated in Won on a Korean GAAP basis increased from 1.7% as of December 31, 2002 to 2.7% as of December 31, 2004, but decreased to 1.9% as of December 31, 2005, to 1.4% as of December 31, 2006 and further decreased under the new method of calculation to 0.9% as of December 31, 2007. Despite such decreases, our delinquency ratio may increase in 2008 as a result of, among other things, adverse economic conditions in Korea and, accordingly, we may be required to take measures to decrease our exposures to these customers. Many small- and medium-sized enterprises represent sole proprietorships or very small businesses dependent on a relatively limited number of suppliers or customers and tend to be affected to a greater extent than large corporate borrowers by fluctuations in the Korean economy. In addition, small- and medium-sized enterprises often maintain less sophisticated financial records than large corporate borrowers. Therefore, it is generally more difficult for us to judge the level of risk inherent in lending to these enterprises, as compared to large corporations. Financial difficulties experienced by small- and medium-sized enterprises as a result of, among other things, adverse economic conditions in Korea, as well as aggressive marketing and intense competition among banks to lend to this segment, have led to a deterioration in the asset quality of our loans to this segment in the past and such factors may lead to a deterioration of asset quality in the future. Any such deterioration would result in increased charge-offs and higher provisioning and reduced interest and fee income from this segment, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many small- and medium-sized enterprises have close business relationships with large corporations in Korea, primarily as suppliers. Any difficulties encountered by those large corporations would likely hurt the liquidity and financial condition of related small- and medium-sized enterprises, including those to which we have exposure, also resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay loans. Recently, some Korean large corporations have expanded into China and other countries with lower labor costs and other expenses through relocating their production plants and facilities to such countries, which may have a material adverse impact on such small- and medium-sized enterprises. We have exposure to the largest Korean commercial conglomerates, known as chaebols, and, as a result, recent and any future financial difficulties of chaebols may have an adverse impact on us. Of our 20 largest corporate exposures (including loans, debt and equity securities, credit-related commitments and other exposures) as of December 31, 2007, eleven were to companies that were members of the 30 largest chaebols in Korea. As of that date, the total amount of our exposures to the 30 largest chaebols was (Won)30,777 billion, or 13.8% of our total exposures. If the credit quality of our exposures to chaebols declines, we could require additional loan loss provisions, which would hurt our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 4B. Business OverviewAssets and LiabilitiesLoan PortfolioExposure to Chaebols. The allowances we have established against these exposures may not be sufficient to cover all future losses arising from these exposures. In addition, in the case of companies that are in or in the future enter into workout, restructuring, reorganization or liquidation proceedings, our recoveries from those companies may be limited. We may, therefore, experience future losses with respect to these exposures. A large portion of our exposure is concentrated in a relatively small number of large corporate borrowers, which increases the risk of our corporate credit portfolio. As of December 31, 2007, our 20 largest exposures to corporate borrowers totaled (Won)30,763 billion, which represented 13.7% of our total exposures. As of that date, our single largest corporate exposure was to the Bank of Korea, to which we had outstanding credits in the form of debt securities of (Won)10,021 billion, representing 4.5% of our total exposures. Aside from exposure to the Bank of Korea and other government-related agencies, our next largest exposure was to Industrial Bank of Korea, to which we had outstanding exposure of (Won)2,334 billion representing 1.0% of our total exposures. Any deterioration in the financial condition of our large 13 Table of Contents corporate borrowers may require us to take substantial additional provisions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We have exposure to companies that are currently or may in the future be put in restructuring, and we may suffer losses as a result of additional loan loss provisions required or the adoption of restructuring plans with which we do not agree. As of December 31, 2007, our credit exposures to companies that were in workout, corporate restructuring, composition or corporate reorganization amounted to (Won)406 billion or 0.2% of our total credit exposures, of which (Won)235 billion or 57.9% was classified as substandard or below and all of which was classified as impaired. As of the same date, our allowances for loan losses on these credit exposures amounted to (Won)136 billion, or 33.4% of these exposures. These allowances may not be sufficient to cover all future losses arising from our credit exposure to these companies. Furthermore, we have other exposure to such companies, in the form of debt and equity securities of such companies held by us (including equity securities we acquired as a result of debt-to-equity conversions). Including such securities, our exposures as of December 31, 2007 to companies in workout, restructuring, corporate reorganization or composition amounted to (Won)557 billion, or 0.3% of our total exposures. Risks relating to our consumer credit portfolio We may experience increases in delinquencies in our consumer loan and credit card portfolios. In recent years, consumer debt has increased rapidly in Korea. Our portfolio of consumer loans has grown from (Won)32,302 billion as of December 31, 2004 to (Won)59,523 billion as of December 31, 2007. While our credit card portfolio decreased from (Won)2,128 billion as of December 31, 2004 to (Won)2,092 billion as of December 31, 2005 as a result of increased charge-offs and our efforts to reduce our credit card exposure, it increased to (Won)2,405 billion as of December 31, 2006 and increased further to (Won)3,325 billion as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, our consumer loans and credit card receivables represented 37.2% and 2.1% of our total lending, respectively. The rapid growth in our consumer loan portfolio in recent years may lead to increasing delinquencies and a deterioration in asset quality. Our consumer loans classified as substandard or below decreased from (Won)498 billion, or 1.5% of our consumer loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2004 to (Won)241 billion, or 0.4% of our consumer loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2007. We charged off consumer loans amounting to (Won)186 billion in 2007, as compared to (Won)74 billion in 2006, and recorded provisions in respect of consumer loans of (Won)133 billion in 2007, as compared to (Won)109 billion in 2006. Within our consumer loan portfolio, the outstanding balance of general purpose household loans, which, unlike mortgage or home equity loans, are often unsecured and therefore tend to carry a higher credit risk, has increased from (Won)14,175 billion, or 43.9% of our total outstanding consumer loans, as of December 31, 2004 to (Won)30,967 billion, or 52.0% of our total outstanding consumer loans, as of December 31, 2007. In our credit card segment, outstanding balances overdue by 30 days or more decreased from (Won)136 billion, or 6.4% of our credit card receivables, as of December 31, 2004 to (Won)71 billion, or 2.1% of our credit card receivables, as of December 31, 2007. In line with industry practice, we have restructured a portion of our delinquent credit card account balances as loans. As of December 31, 2007, these restructured loans amounted to (Won)9 billion, or 0.3% of our credit card balances. Because these restructured loans are not initially recorded as being delinquent, our delinquency ratios do not fully reflect all delinquent amounts relating to our credit card balances. Including all restructured loans, outstanding balances overdue by 30 days or more accounted for 2.4% of our credit card balances as of December 31, 2007. We charged off credit card balances amounting to (Won)83 billion in 2007, as compared to (Won)87 billion in 2006, and recorded provisions in respect of credit card balances of (Won)24 billion in 2007, as compared to a reversal of provisions of (Won)5 billion in 2006. Delinquencies may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, adverse economic developments in Korea, difficulties 14 Table of Contents experienced by other credit card issuers that adversely affect our customers, additional government regulation or the inability of Korean consumers to manage increased household debt. A deterioration of the asset quality of our consumer loan and credit card portfolios would require us to increase our loan loss provisions and charge-offs and will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our large exposure to consumer debt means that we are exposed to changes in economic conditions affecting Korean consumers. Accordingly, economic difficulties in Korea that hurt those consumers could result in further deterioration in the credit quality of our consumer loan and credit card portfolios. For example, a rise in unemployment or an increase in interest rates in Korea could adversely affect the ability of consumers to make payments and increase the likelihood of potential defaults. A decline in the value of the collateral securing our consumer loans and our inability to realize full collateral value may adversely affect our consumer credit portfolio. A substantial portion of our consumer loans is secured by real estate, the values of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Although it is our general policy to lend up to 60% of the appraised value of collateral (except in areas of high speculation designated by the government where we are required to limit our lending to 40% of the appraised value of collateral) and to periodically re-appraise our collateral, downturns in the real estate markets in Korea from time to time have resulted in declines in the value of the collateral securing some loans to levels below their outstanding principal balance. Future declines in real estate prices would reduce the value of the collateral securing our mortgage and home equity loans. If collateral values decline in the future, they may not be sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts in respect of our secured loans. Any declines in the value of the real estate or other collateral securing our consumer loans, or our inability to obtain additional collateral in the event of such declines, could result in a deterioration in our asset quality and may require us to take additional loan loss provisions. In Korea, foreclosure on collateral generally requires a written petition to a court. An application, when made, may be subject to delays and administrative requirements that may decrease the value of such collateral. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to realize the full value on our collateral as a result of, among other factors, delays in foreclosure proceedings and defects in the perfection of our security interest in collateral. Our failure to recover the expected value of collateral could expose us to potential losses. Risks relating to our financial holding company structure and strategy Woori Finance Holdings has a limited operating history as a financial holding company, and our continued success cannot be assured. Woori Finance Holdings was established in March 2001 by the KDIC as a financial holding company to consolidate the Korean governments interests in four commercial banks (Hanvit Bank, Kyongnam Bank, Kwangju Bank and Peace Bank of Korea), one merchant bank and a number of other financial institutions. Each of these financial institutions was experiencing significant financial difficulties, including a sharp deterioration in asset quality and capital adequacy ratios and a net capital deficit, as a result of the Korean financial crisis that began in 1997, and had been recapitalized by the Korean government using public funds injected through the KDIC. Since that time, we have reorganized some of those business operations, and we may decide to implement other transfers or reorganizations with respect to our subsidiaries business operations in the future. While we believe that we have generally succeeded in improving our overall financial condition and normalizing our operations, we have a limited operating history as a financial holding company, particularly under our current structure and organization, and may experience difficulties in managing a larger and more diverse business. Accordingly, our continued success cannot be assured. 15 Table of Contents We may not succeed in implementing our current strategy to take advantage of our integrated financial holding company structure. Our success under a financial holding company structure depends on our ability to take advantage of our large existing base of retail and corporate banking customers and to implement a strategy of developing and cross-selling diverse financial products and services to them. As part of this strategy, we have standardized our subsidiaries risk management operations (except with respect to operational risk), including with respect to credit risk management following systems upgrades completed in 2007. We also plan to continue to diversify our product offerings through, among other things, increased marketing of insurance products and expansion of our investment banking and investment trust operations. The continued implementation of these plans may require additional investments of capital, infrastructure, human resources and management attention. This strategy entails certain risks, including the possibility that:  we may fail to successfully integrate our diverse systems and operations;  we may lack required capital resources;  we may fail to attract, develop and retain personnel with necessary expertise;  we may face competition from other financial holding companies and more specialized financial institutions in particular segments; and  we may fail to leverage our financial holding company structure to realize operational efficiencies and to cross-sell multiple products and services. If our strategy does not succeed, we may incur losses on our investments and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits relating to our reorganization and integration plan and any future acquisitions that we make. Our success under a financial holding company structure depends on our ability to implement our reorganization and integration plan and to realize the anticipated synergies, growth opportunities and cost savings from coordinating and, in certain cases, combining the businesses of our various subsidiaries. As part of this plan, between December 2001 and February 2002 we merged the commercial banking business of Peace Bank of Korea into Woori Bank, converted Peace Bank of Korea into a credit card subsidiary, Woori Credit Card, and transferred the credit card business of Woori Bank to Woori Credit Card. We also transferred the credit card business of Kwangju Bank to Woori Credit Card in March 2003. In light of the deteriorating business performance of Woori Investment Bank and with the objective of restructuring the group platform, we merged Woori Investment Bank with Woori Bank in August 2003. In March 2004, in response to the liquidity problems of Woori Credit Card stemming from the deteriorating asset quality of its credit card portfolio, we merged Woori Credit Card with Woori Bank. Although we currently intend for our commercial banking subsidiaries to continue to operate as separate legal entities within our financial holding company structure and to maintain separate loan origination and other functions, we have standardized our subsidiaries risk management operations (except with respect to operational risk), including with respect to credit risk management following systems upgrades completed in 2007. In October and December 2004, we also acquired a 27.3% voting interest in LGIS, a leading domestic securities firm. In March 2005, we merged Woori Securities into LGIS and renamed the surviving entity Woori Investment & Securities, which became an equity method investee. See Item 4B. Business OverviewBusinessCapital Markets ActivitiesSecurities Brokerage. In May 2005, we purchased a 90.0% direct ownership interest in LG Investment Trust Management, or LGITM, from LGIS. We subsequently merged Woori Investment Trust Management, our wholly-owned asset management subsidiary, into LGITM and renamed the surviving entity Woori Asset Management, which remains a consolidated subsidiary. In July and September 2005, Woori Asset Management reacquired the remaining 10.0% interest from its minority shareholders. In May 2006, we transferred 30.0% of our interest in Woori Asset Management to Credit Suisse. Following this transfer, we renamed the entity Woori Credit Suisse Asset Management. As part of our business 16 Table of Contents plan, we have, through Woori Bank, Kyongnam Bank and Kwangju Bank, also entered into bancassurance marketing arrangements with third party insurance companies. See Item 4B. Business OverviewBusinessOther BusinessesBancassurance. Furthermore, we acquired a 51.4% interest in Hanmi Capital in September 2007, which was subsequently renamed Woori Financial, and acquired a 51.0% interest in LIG Life Insurance in April 2008, which was subsequently renamed Woori Aviva Life Insurance. Woori Financial became a consolidated subsidiary, while we expect to account for Woori Aviva Life Insurance as an equity method investee under U.S. GAAP. Although we have been integrating certain aspects of our subsidiaries operations in our financial holding company structure, they will generally continue to operate as independent entities with separate management and staff. Further integration of our subsidiaries separate businesses and operations, as well as those of any companies we may acquire in the future, could require a significant amount of time, financial resources and management attention. Moreover, that process could disrupt our operations (including our risk management operations) or information technology systems, reduce employee morale, produce unintended inconsistencies in our standards, controls, procedures or policies, and affect our relationships with customers and our ability to retain key personnel. The continued implementation of our reorganization and integration plan, as well as any future additional integration plans that we may adopt in connection with our acquisitions or otherwise, and the realization of the anticipated benefits of our financial holding company structure may be blocked, delayed or reduced as a result of many factors, some of which may be outside our control. These factors include:  difficulties in integrating the diverse activities and operations of our subsidiaries or any companies we may acquire, including risk management operations and information technology systems, personnel, policies and procedures;  difficulties in reorganizing or reducing overlapping personnel, branches, networks and administrative functions;  restrictions under the Financial Holding Company Act and other regulations on transactions between our company and, or among, our subsidiaries;  unexpected business disruptions;  loss of customers; and  labor unrest. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of our current or any future reorganization and integration plan and any future acquisitions that we make, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer as a result. We may not generate sufficient additional fees to achieve our revenue diversification strategy. An important element of our overall strategy is increasing our fee income in order to diversify our revenue base, in anticipation of greater competition and declining lending margins. Historically, our primary source of revenues has been net interest income from our banking operations. To date, except for credit card, trust management, bancassurance, brokerage and currency transfer fees (including foreign exchange-related commissions) and fees collected in connection with the operation of our investment funds, we have not generated substantial fee income. We intend to develop new sources of fee income as part of our business strategy, including through our investment banking and asset management businesses. Although we, like many other Korean financial institutions, have begun to charge fees to our customers more regularly, customers may prove unwilling to pay additional fees, even in exchange for more attractive value-added services, and their reluctance to do so would adversely affect the implementation of this aspect of our strategy. In 2007, our subsidiary Woori Bank reduced or waived many of the fees it charges on its banking services, in response to customer demand and to similar measures taken by other commercial banks in Korea. Specifically, 17 Table of Contents Woori Bank reduced or waived its fees on fund transfers through its ATMs, and exempted its fees on fund transfers through its mobile banking services. Woori Bank also waived the fees it charges on the opening of household checking accounts and on the issuance of bankers checks and certain tax-related statements. In addition, in March 2008, we began a stockholder benefits program whereby Woori Bank will reduce or waive various fees, including foreign exchange-related commissions and credit card annual membership fees, for holders of ten shares or more of our common stock. These measures may adversely affect our fee income. We depend on limited forms of funding to fund our operations at the holding company level. We are a financial holding company with no significant assets other than the shares of our subsidiaries. Our primary sources of funding and liquidity are dividends from our subsidiaries, direct borrowings and issuances of equity or debt securities at the holding company level. In addition, as a financial holding company, we are required to meet certain minimum financial ratios under Korean law, including with respect to liquidity, leverage and capital adequacy. Our ability to meet our obligations to our direct creditors and employees and our other liquidity needs and regulatory requirements at the holding company level depends on timely and adequate distributions from our subsidiaries and our ability to sell our securities or obtain credit from our lenders. In the case of dividend distributions, this depends on the financial condition and operating results of our subsidiaries. In the future, our subsidiaries may enter into agreements, such as credit agreements with lenders or indentures relating to high-yield or subordinated debt instruments, that impose restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, and the terms of future obligations and the operation of Korean law could prevent our subsidiaries from making sufficient distributions to us to allow us to make payments on our outstanding obligations. See As a holding company, we depend on receiving dividends from our subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock. Any delay in receipt of or shortfall in payments to us from our subsidiaries could result in our inability to meet our liquidity needs and regulatory requirements, including minimum liquidity, double leverage and capital adequacy ratios, and may disrupt our operations at the holding company level. In addition, creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have claims that are prior to any claims of our creditors with respect to their assets. Furthermore, our inability to sell our securities or obtain funds from our lenders on favorable terms, or at all, could also result in our inability to meet our liquidity needs and regulatory requirements and may disrupt our operations at the holding company level. As a holding company, we depend on receiving dividends from our subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock. Since our principal assets at the holding company level are the shares of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock largely depends on dividend payments from those subsidiaries. Those dividend payments are subject to the Korean Commercial Code, the Bank Act and regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and retained earnings, imposed by the various regulatory agencies with authority over those entities. The ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions to the extent that paying dividends would impair each of their nonconsolidated profitability, financial condition or other cash flow needs. For example:  under the Korean Commercial Code, dividends may only be paid out of distributable income, an amount which is calculated by subtracting the aggregate amount of a companys paid-in capital and certain mandatory legal reserves from its net assets, in each case as of the end of the prior fiscal period;  under the Bank Act, a bank also must credit at least 10% of its net profit to a legal reserve each time it pays dividends on distributable income until that reserve equals the amount of its total paid-in capital; and  under the Bank Act and the requirements of the Financial Services Commission, if a bank fails to meet its required capital adequacy ratio or otherwise subject to the management improvement measures imposed by the Financial Services Commission, then the Financial Services Commission may restrict the declaration and payment of dividends by that bank. 18 Table of Contents Our subsidiaries may not continue to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements for the payment of dividends in the future. If they fail to do so, they may stop paying or reduce the amount of the dividends they pay to us, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends to the extent that such payments would result in a failure to meet any of the applicable financial targets under our respective memoranda of understanding with the KDIC. See Other risks relating to our businessOur failure to meet the financial and other business targets set forth in current terms of the memoranda of understanding among us, our subsidiaries and the KDIC may result in substantial harm to us or our subsidiaries. Risks relating to competition Competition in the Korean financial industry is intense, and we may lose market share and experience declining margins as a result. Competition in the Korean financial market has been and is likely to remain intense. Some of the financial institutions that we compete with are larger in terms of asset size and customer base and have greater financial resources or more specialized capabilities than our subsidiaries. In addition, in the area of our core banking operations, most Korean banks have been focusing on retail customers and small- and medium-sized enterprises in recent years, although they are beginning to increase their exposure to large corporate borrowers, and have been focusing on developing fee income businesses, including bancassurance and investment products, as increasingly important sources of revenue. In the area of credit cards, Korean banks and credit card companies have in the past engaged in aggressive marketing activities and made significant investments, contributing to some extent to lower profitability and asset quality problems previously experienced with respect to credit card receivables. The competition and market saturation resulting from this common focus may make it more difficult for us to secure retail and small- and medium-sized customers with the credit quality and on credit terms necessary to maintain or increase our income and profitability. In addition, we believe that regulatory reforms, including the enactment of the Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act in 2007, and the general modernization of business practices in Korea will lead to increased competition among financial institutions in Korea. We also believe that foreign financial institutions, many of which have greater experience and resources than we do, will seek to compete with us in providing financial products and services either by themselves or in partnership with existing Korean financial institutions. Furthermore, a number of significant mergers and acquisitions in the industry have taken place in Korea over the last few years, including the acquisition of Koram Bank by an affiliate of Citibank in 2004, the acquisition of Korea First Bank by Standard Chartered Bank in April 2005 and Chohung Banks merger with Shinhan Bank in April 2006, as well as the proposed acquisition of Korea Exchange Bank by HSBC. We expect that consolidation in the financial industry will continue. Some of the financial institutions resulting from this consolidation may, by virtue of their increased size and business scope, provide greater competition for us. Increased competition and continuing consolidation may lead to decreased margins, resulting in a material adverse impact on our future profitability. Accordingly our results of operations and financial condition may suffer as a result of increasing competition in the Korean financial industry. Competition for customer deposits may increase, resulting in a loss of our deposit customers or an increase in our funding costs. In recent years, we have faced increasing pricing pressure on deposit products from our competitors. If we do not continue to offer competitive interest rates to our deposit customers, we may lose their business. In addition, even if we are able to match our competitors pricing, doing so may result in an increase in our funding costs, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Other risks relating to our business Difficult conditions in the global credit and financial markets could adversely affect our liquidity and performance. During the second and third quarter of 2007, credit markets in the United States started to experience difficult conditions and volatility that in turn have affected worldwide financial markets. In particular, in late July and early August 2007, market uncertainty in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage sector increased dramatically and further expanded to other markets such as those for leveraged finance, collateralized debt obligations and other structured products. These conditions have resulted in reduced liquidity, greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the United States and global credit and financial markets. We are exposed to adverse developments in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market through our holdings of collateralized debt obligations related to U.S. mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2007, we held, through Woori Bank, approximately (Won)980 billion in face value of collateralized debt obligations, of which approximately (Won)460 billion were related to U.S. sub-prime mortgages. We recognized impairment losses of (Won)417 billion in 2007 with respect to our holdings of U.S. sub-prime mortgage-related collateralized debt obligations as well as impairment losses of (Won)89 billion with respect to other collateralized debt obligations, which in turn resulted in a decrease in net gain on investment securities and contributed to a decrease in our non-interest income in 2007 as compared to 2006. We are also exposed to adverse developments in the U.S. and global credit markets through our holdings of derivatives. As of December 31, 2007, our total exposure under credit derivatives outstanding was approximately (Won)615 billion (including (Won)146 billion of credit derivatives relating to Korean companies), principally through credit default swaps and total return swaps held by Woori Bank. We recognized losses on valuation of our credit derivatives amounting to (Won)130 billion in 2007, which in turn resulted in a decrease in our net trading revenue and contributed to a decrease in our non-interest income in 2007 as compared to 2006. Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2008, the fair value of our holdings of collateralized debt obligations and credit derivatives declined further following the downgrades of ratings of such instruments by various rating agencies. For the three months ended March 31, 2008, on a Korean GAAP basis, we recognized a decrease in the fair value of our holdings of collateralized debt obligations of approximately (Won)93 billion and losses on valuation of our credit derivatives of approximately (Won)44 billion. Continued adverse conditions in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage and U.S. and global credit markets could result in additional losses on collateralized debt obligations as well as credit derivatives held by us. In addition, recent increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, may affect our ability to borrow, which may adversely affect our liquidity and performance. In the event that the current difficult conditions in the global credit markets continue, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our lending and other activities. This could cause us to curtail our business activities and could increase our cost of funding, both of which may reduce our profitability. Our failure to meet the financial and other business targets set forth in current terms of the memoranda of understanding among us, our subsidiaries and the KDIC may result in substantial harm to us or our subsidiaries. Under the current terms of the memoranda of understanding entered into among us, Woori Bank, Kyongnam Bank, Kwangju Bank and the KDIC, we and our subsidiaries are required to meet certain financial and business targets on a semi-annual and/or quarterly basis until the end of 2008. See Item 4A. History and Development of the CompanyHistoryRelationship with the Korean Government. Due to its merger with Woori Credit Card, Woori Bank failed to meet its return on assets target and operating profit per employee target as of June 30, 2004. We also failed to meet three of the financial targets as of June 30, 2004, which were return on total assets, expense to revenue ratio, and operating income per employee. The KDIC notified us that we could not improve fringe benefits for our employees (including salaries), and ordered us to devise and report to the KDIC a plan to meet those three financial targets. We negotiated with the KDIC to adjust some of the financial targets applicable to us and our subsidiaries under our memoranda of understanding and, as a result, each of us, Woori Bank, Kyongnam Bank and Kwangju Bank have met all of our financial targets subsequent to such adjustments. 20 Table of Contents If we or our subsidiaries fail to satisfy our obligations under the current or any new memoranda of understanding in the future, the Korean government, through the KDIC, may impose penalties on us or our subsidiaries. These penalties could include the replacement of our senior management, sale of our assets, restructuring of our organization, restrictions on our business, including a suspension or transfer of our business, and elimination or reduction of existing equity. Accordingly, our failure to meet the obligations in the memoranda of understanding may result in harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have provided certain assets as collateral in connection with our secured borrowings and could be required to make payments and realize losses in the future relating to those assets. We have provided certain assets as collateral for our secured borrowings in recent years. These secured borrowings often take the form of asset securitization transactions, where we nominally sell our assets to a securitization vehicle that issues securities backed by those assets, although the assets remain on our balance sheet. These secured borrowings are intended to be fully repaid through recoveries on collateral. Some of these nominal asset sales were with recourse, which means that if delinquencies arise with respect to such assets, we will be required to either repay a proportionate amount of the related secured borrowing (by reversing the nominal sale and repurchasing such assets) or compensate the securitization vehicle for any net shortfalls in its recoveries on such assets. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of assets we had provided as collateral for our secured borrowings was (Won)4,573 billion. As of that date, we had established allowances of (Won)1 billion in respect of possible losses on those assets. If we are required to make payments on such assets, or to repay our secured borrowings on those assets and are unable to make sufficient recoveries on them, we may realize further losses on these assets to the extent those payments or recovery shortfalls exceed our allowances. An increase in interest rates would decrease the value of our debt securities portfolio and raise our funding costs while reducing loan demand and the repayment ability of our borrowers, which could adversely affect us. From 2000 to 2004, interest rates in Korea declined to historically low levels as the government sought to stimulate economic growth through active rate-lowering measures. Interest rates began to rebound in the second half of 2005 and stabilized in 2006 and 2007, although they have declined again in 2008. Approximately 91.8% of the debt securities our banking subsidiaries hold pay interest at a fixed rate. All else being equal, an increase in interest rates would lead to a decline in the value of traded debt securities. A sustained increase in interest rates will also raise our funding costs, while reducing loan demand, especially among consumers. Rising interest rates may therefore require us to re-balance our assets and liabilities in order to minimize the risk of potential mismatches and maintain our profitability. See Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition, rising interest rate levels may adversely affect the Korean economy and the financial condition of our corporate and consumer borrowers, including holders of our credit cards, which in turn may lead to a deterioration in our credit portfolio. In particular, since most of our consumer and corporate loans bear interest at rates that adjust periodically based on prevailing market rates, a sustained increase in interest rate levels will increase the interest costs of our consumer and corporate borrowers and will adversely affect their ability to make payments on their outstanding loans. Our funding is highly dependent on short-term deposits, which dependence may adversely affect our operations. Our banking subsidiaries meet a significant amount of their funding requirements through short-term funding sources, which consist primarily of customer deposits. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 93.6% of these deposits had maturities of one year or less or were payable on demand. In the past, a substantial proportion of these customer deposits have been rolled over upon maturity. We cannot guarantee, however, that depositors will continue to roll over their deposits in the future. In the event that a substantial number of these short-term deposit customers withdraw their funds or fail to roll over their deposits as higher-yielding investment 21 Table of Contents opportunities emerge, our liquidity position could be adversely affected. Our banking subsidiaries may also be required to seek more expensive sources of short-term and long-term funding to finance their operations. See Item 5B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial ConditionCapital Adequacy. Labor union unrest may disrupt our operations and hinder our ability to continue to reorganize and integrate our operations. Most financial institutions in Korea, including our subsidiaries, have experienced periods of labor unrest. As part of our reorganization and integration plan, we have transferred or merged some of the businesses operations of our subsidiaries into one or more entities and implemented other forms of corporate and operational restructuring. We may decide to implement other organizational or operational changes, as well as acquisitions or dispositions, in the future. Such efforts have in the past been met with significant opposition from labor unions in Korea. For example, in June 2003, members of Chohung Banks labor union went on strike to express their opposition to the proposed sale by the KDIC of its interest in that bank to Shinhan Financial Group. Furthermore, in July 2004, members of Koram Banks labor union engaged in a strike to obtain concessions in connection with the acquisition of Koram Bank by an affiliate of Citibank. Although we did not experience any major labor disputes in connection with the merger of Woori Credit Card with Woori Bank, our employees at Woori Securities staged a one-month strike to protest the merger of Woori Securities into LGIS in March 2005. Actual or threatened labor disputes may in the future disrupt the reorganization and integration process and our business operations, which in turn may hurt our financial condition and results of operations. The secondary market for corporate bonds in Korea is not fully developed, and, as a result, we may not be able to realize the full marked-to-market value of debt securities we hold when we sell any of those securities. As of December 31, 2007, our banking subsidiaries held debt securities issued by Korean companies and financial institutions (other than those issued by government-owned or -controlled enterprises or financial institutions, which include the KDIC, the Korea Electric Power Corporation, the Bank of Korea, the Korea Development Bank and the Industrial Bank of Korea) with a total book value of (Won)17,912 billion in our trading and investment securities portfolio. The market value of these securities could decline significantly due to various factors, including future increases in interest rates or a deterioration in the financial and economic condition of any particular issuer or of Korea in general. Any of these factors individually or a combination of these factors would require us to write down the fair value of these debt securities, resulting in impairment losses. Because the secondary market for corporate bonds in Korea is not fully developed, the market value of many of these securities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is determined by references to suggested prices posted by Korean rating agencies or the Korea Securities Dealers Association. These valuations, however, may differ significantly from the actual value that we could realize in the event we elect to sell these securities. As a result, we may not be able to realize the full marked-to-market value at the time of any such sale of these securities and thus may incur additional losses. We and our commercial banking subsidiaries may be required to raise additional capital to maintain our capital adequacy ratio or for other reasons, which we or they may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all. Under the new capital adequacy requirements of the Financial Services Commission which came into effect on January 1, 2007, we, as a bank holding company, are required to maintain a minimum consolidated capital adequacy ratio, which is the ratio of equity capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets on a consolidated Korean GAAP basis, of 8.0%. See Item 4B. Business OverviewSupervision and RegulationPrincipal Regulations Applicable to Financial Holding CompaniesCapital Adequacy and Item 5B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial ConditionCapital Adequacy. In addition, each of our commercial banking subsidiaries is required to maintain a minimum combined Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratio of 8.0%, on a consolidated Korean GAAP basis. In both cases, Tier II capital is included in calculating the combined Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratio up to 100% of Tier I capital. In addition, the memoranda of understanding among 22 Table of Contents us, our subsidiaries and the KDIC require us and our subsidiaries to meet specified capital adequacy ratio requirements. See Item 4A. History and Development of the CompanyHistoryRelationship with the Korean Government. As of December 31, 2007, our capital ratio and the capital adequacy ratios of our subsidiaries exceeded the minimum levels required by both the Financial Services Commission and these memoranda. However, our capital base and capital adequacy ratio or those of our subsidiaries may deteriorate in the future if our or their results of operations or financial condition deteriorates for any reason, or if we or they are not able to deploy their funding into suitably low-risk assets. To the extent that our subsidiaries fail to maintain their capital adequacy ratios in the future, Korean regulatory authorities may impose penalties on them ranging from a warning to suspension or revocation of their licenses. If our capital adequacy ratio or those of our subsidiaries deteriorate, we or they may be required to obtain additional Tier I or Tier II capital in order to remain in compliance with the applicable capital adequacy requirements. As the financial holding company for our subsidiaries, we may be required to raise additional capital to contribute to our subsidiaries. We or our subsidiaries may not be able to obtain additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. The ability of our company and our subsidiaries to obtain additional capital at any time may be constrained to the extent that banks or other financial institutions in Korea or from other Asian countries are seeking to raise capital at the same time. Depending on whether we or our subsidiaries are obtaining any necessary additional capital, and the terms and amount of any additional capital obtained, holders of our common stock or American depositary shares, or ADSs, may experience a dilution of their interest, or we may experience a dilution of our interest in our subsidiaries. We may face increased capital requirements under the new Basel Capital Accord. Beginning on January 1, 2008, the Financial Supervisory Service implemented the new Basel Capital Accord, referred to as Basel II, in Korea, which has affected the way risk is measured among Korean financial institutions, including our commercial banking subsidiaries. Building upon the initial Basel Capital Accord of 1988, which focused primarily on capital adequacy and asset soundness as a measure of risk, Basel II expands this approach to contemplate additional areas of risk such as operational risk. Basel II also institutes new measures that require our commercial banking subsidiaries to take into account individual borrower credit risk and operational risk when calculating risk-weighted assets. In addition, under Basel II, banks are permitted to follow either a standardized approach or an internal ratings-based approach with respect to calculating capital requirements. Woori Bank is currently using a standardized approach but has voluntarily chosen to establish and follow an internal ratings-based approach, which is more stringent in terms of calculating risk sensitivity with respect to its capital requirements and is expected to be implemented in 2009. Kyongnam Bank and Kwangju Bank have chosen to use a standardized approach. While we believe that Woori Banks implementation of an internal ratings-based approach for the first time in 2009 will not lead to a significant increase in its capital requirements, there can be no assurance that such internal ratings-based approach under Basel II will not require an increase in Woori Banks credit risk capital requirements in the future, which may require it to either improve its asset quality or raise additional capital. See Item 5A. Operating ResultsOverviewNew Basel Capital Accord and Item 5B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial ConditionCapital Adequacy. Our Internet banking services are subject to security concerns relating to the commercial use of the Internet. We provide Internet banking services to our retail and corporate customers, which require sensitive customer information, including passwords and account information, to be transferred over a secure connection on the Internet. However, connections on the Internet, although secure, are not free from security breaches. We may experience security breaches in connection with our Internet banking service in the future, which may result in liability to our customers and third parties and materially and adversely affect our business. 23 Table of Contents We may experience disruptions, delays and other difficulties from our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems for our daily operations including billing, effecting online and offline banking transactions and record keeping. We may experience disruptions, delays or other difficulties from our information technology systems, which may have an adverse effect on our business and adversely impact our customers confidence in us. We do not publish interim financial information on a U.S. GAAP basis. Neither we nor our subsidiaries publish interim financial information on a U.S. GAAP basis. U.S. GAAP differs in significant respects from Korean GAAP, particularly with respect to the establishment of loan loss allowances and provisions. See Item 5B. Financial ConditionSelected Financial Information Under Korean GAAP and Reconciliation with Korean GAAP. As a result, our allowance and provision levels, as well as certain other balance sheet and income statement items, reflected in our interim financial statements under Korean GAAP may differ substantially from those required to be reflected under U.S. GAAP. We are generally subject to Korean corporate governance and disclosure standards, which differ in significant respects from those in other countries. Companies in Korea, including us, are subject to corporate governance standards applicable to Korean public companies which differ in many respects from standards applicable in other countries, including the United States. As a reporting company registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we are subject to certain corporate governance standards as mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, foreign private issuers, including us, are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. There may also be less publicly available information about Korean companies, such as us, than is regularly made available by public or non-public companies in other countries. Such differences in corporate governance standards and less public information could result in less than satisfactory corporate governance practices or disclosure to investors in certain countries. Risks relating to government control The KDIC, which is our controlling stockholder, is controlled by the Korean government and could cause us to take actions or pursue policy objectives that may be against your interests. The Korean government, through the KDIC, currently owns 72.97% of our outstanding common stock. So long as the Korean government remains our controlling stockholder, it will have the ability to cause us to take actions or pursue policy objectives that may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. For example, in order to further its public policy goals, the Korean government could request that we participate with respect to a takeover of a troubled financial institution or encourage us to provide financial support to particular entities or sectors. Such actions or others that are not consistent with maximizing our profits or the value of our common stock may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and may cause the price of our common stock and ADSs to decline. In addition, pursuant to the terms of our memorandum of understanding with the KDIC, we are required to take any necessary actions (including share buybacks and payment of dividends) to return to the KDIC the funds it injected into us and our subsidiaries, so long as those actions do not cause a material adverse effect on the normalization of our business operations as contemplated by the memorandum of understanding. Any actions that we take as a result of this requirement may favor the KDIC over our other stockholders and may therefore be against your interests. 24 Table of Contents Risks relating to government regulation and policy New loan loss provisioning guidelines implemented by the Financial Services Commission may require us to increase our provisioning levels under Korean GAAP, which could adversely affect us. In recent years, the Financial Services Commission (formerly the Financial Supervisory Commission) has implemented changes to the loan loss provisioning requirements applicable to Korean banks, which have resulted in increases to our provisions and adversely impacted our reported results of operations and financial condition under Korean GAAP. Until 2004, the requirement to establish allowances for possible losses in respect of confirmed acceptances and guarantees under Korean GAAP applied only to those classified as substandard or below. Commencing in the second half of 2005, the requirement was extended to cover confirmed acceptances and guarantees classified as normal or precautionary, as well as unconfirmed acceptances and guarantees and bills endorsed. Similarly, until 2004, the requirement to establish other allowances in respect of unused credit lines under Korean GAAP applied only to the unused credit limit for cash advances on active credit card accounts, defined as those with a transaction recorded during the past year. Commencing in the second half of 2005, the requirement was extended to cover the unused credit limit for credit card purchases on active accounts, as well as the unused credit limit on consumer and corporate loans. Due to these changes, our consolidated allowance for acceptances and guarantees and other allowances under Korean GAAP increased by (Won)23 billion and (Won)134 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2005, and our consolidated income before income tax under Korean GAAP for 2005 decreased by (Won)157 billion. Furthermore, in the second half of 2006, the Financial Services Commission increased the minimum required provisioning levels applicable under Korean GAAP to loans, confirmed and unconfirmed acceptances and guarantees, bills endorsed and unused credit lines that are classified as normal and precautionary. The Financial Services Commission also extended the requirement to establish other allowances on unused credit lines under Korean GAAP to cover inactive credit card accounts. As a result of these changes, our consolidated allowance for loan losses, allowance for acceptances and guarantees and other allowances for unused lines of credit under Korean GAAP increased by (Won)283 billion, (Won)17 billion and (Won)125 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2006, and our consolidated income before income tax under Korean GAAP for 2006 decreased by (Won)425 billion. In addition, in the second half of 2007, the Financial Services Commission increased the minimum required provisioning levels applicable to all loans (other than consumer loans and credit card balances) classified as normal. This change resulted in a significant increase in our consolidated allowance for loan losses, allowance for acceptances and guarantees and other allowances for unused lines of credit under Korean GAAP, and a corresponding decrease in our consolidated income before income tax under Korean GAAP, in 2007. Also, in November 2004, the Financial Services Commission announced that it will implement new loan loss provisioning guidelines, which Korean banks will be required to follow from the end of 2007 in preparing financial statements under Korean GAAP. These guidelines include a new requirement that banks take into account expected losses with respect to credits in establishing their allowance for loan losses, instead of establishing such allowances based on the classification of credits under the current asset classification criteria. Under the new guidelines, all Korean banks were required to establish systems to calculate their expected losses based on their historical losses during 2005. The Financial Services Commission also announced that Korean banks could voluntarily comply with the new loan loss provisioning guidelines commencing in 2005. Specifically, in the second half of 2005, banks that had implemented a credible internal system for evaluating expected losses could establish their allowance for loan losses under Korean GAAP based on their historical losses, so long as the total allowance for loan losses established exceeded the levels required under the asset classification-based provisioning guidelines. Similarly, in the first half of 2006, banks that had implemented a credible system for evaluating expected losses could establish their allowance for loan losses under Korean GAAP based on such expected losses, so long as the total allowance established exceeded required levels. We complied with the new guidelines and implemented a system for evaluating expected losses in establishing our allowance for loan losses, which did not in and of itself result in an increase in our provisions for loan losses 25 Table of Contents under Korean GAAP in 2005 or 2006. However, the Financial Services Commission has not since released any further details regarding the new guidelines, and it is unclear whether such new guidelines will be implemented in the future. Full compliance with the new guidelines may increase our provisions for loan losses under Korean GAAP compared to previous levels established under the asset classification-based provisioning guidelines. Any future required increases in our provisions for loan losses could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition under Korean GAAP and our reported capital adequacy ratio, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and ADSs. Government regulation of consumer lending, particularly mortgage and home equity lending, has recently become more stringent, which may hurt our consumer banking operations. In light of concerns regarding the potential risks of excessive consumer lending, particularly mortgage and home equity lending, the Korean government has in recent years adopted more stringent regulations with respect to consumer lending by Korean banks. The Korean government has also expressed a continuing commitment to stabilize rising prices in the real estate market and a willingness to implement necessary measures for this purpose. For example, from 2004 through 2006, the Korean government:  raised the residential property tax applicable to residential properties in cases where the aggregate value of the residential properties held by a single household exceeds (Won)600 million;  raised the capital gains tax applicable to sales of residential properties in cases where such property belongs to a household that owns more than three, and under certain circumstances more than two, residential properties;  placed a ceiling on the sale price of newly constructed residential properties and, under certain circumstances, required developers to disclose the costs incurred in connection with the construction of such properties;  amended the Urban and Residential Environment Improvement Act to require that at least 25% of any increased floor space resulting from the redevelopment of existing residential properties be devoted to the construction of rental residential properties;  adopted more stringent guidelines that require financial institutions to impose debt-to-income limits on customers, in addition to loan-to-value ratio requirements, in connection with mortgage loans for real estate located in areas of wide-spread real property speculation or excessive investment;  issued unofficial guidance recommending that Korean banks further limit their mortgage and home equity lending; and  adopted new measures to increase the supply of residential properties, including long-term residential lease properties. See Item 4B. Business OverviewSupervision and RegulationPrincipal Regulations Applicable to BanksRecent Regulations Relating to Retail Household Loans. These regulations and measures, as well as any similar regulations that the Korean government may adopt in the future, may have the effect of constraining the growth and profitability of our consumer banking operations, especially in the area of mortgage and home equity lending. Furthermore, these regulations and measures may result in substantial future declines in real estate prices in Korea, which will reduce the value of the collateral securing our mortgage and home equity lending. See Other risks relating to our businessA decline in the value of the collateral securing our loans and our inability to realize full collateral value may adversely affect our credit portfolio. 26 Table of Contents Government regulation of the credit card business has increased significantly in recent years, which may hurt our credit card operations. Due to the rapid growth of the credit card market and rising consumer debt levels in Korea in prior years, the Korean government heightened its regulatory oversight of the credit card industry. From mid-2002 through early 2003, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance (formerly the Ministry of Finance and Economy) and the Financial Services Commission adopted a variety of amendments to existing regulations governing the credit card industry. Among other things, these amendments increased minimum required provisioning levels applicable to credit card receivables, required the reduction in volumes for credit card loans, increased minimum capital ratios and allowed the imposition of new sanctions against credit card companies that failed to meet applicable requirements. The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service also implemented a number of changes to the rules governing the evaluation and reporting of credit card balances and delinquency ratios, as well as procedures governing which persons may receive credit cards. For more details relating to these regulations, see Item 4B. Business OverviewSupervision and RegulationPrincipal Regulations Applicable to BanksCredit Card Business. The Korean government may adopt further regulatory changes in the future that affect the credit card industry. Depending on their nature, such changes may adversely affect our credit card operations, by restricting its growth or scope, subjecting it to stricter requirements and potential sanctions or greater competition, constraining its profitability or otherwise. The Korean government may promote lending and financial support by the Korean financial industry to certain types of borrowers as a matter of policy, which financial institutions, including us, may decide to follow. Through its policy guidelines and recommendations, the Korean government has promoted and, as a matter of policy, may continue to attempt to promote lending by the Korean financial industry to particular types of borrowers. For example, the Korean government has in the past announced policy guidelines requesting financial institutions to participate in remedial programs for troubled corporate borrowers, as well as policies aimed at promoting certain sectors of the economy, including measures such as making low interest funding available to financial institutions that lend to these sectors. The government has in this manner encouraged mortgage lending to low-income individuals and lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises. We expect that all loans or credits made pursuant to these government policies will be reviewed in accordance with our credit approval procedures. However, these or any future government policies may influence us to lend to certain sectors or in a manner in which we otherwise would not in the absence of that policy. In the past, the Korean government has also issued recommendations encouraging financial institutions in Korea to provide financial support to particular economic sectors as a matter of policy. For example, in light of the financial market instability in Korea resulting from the liquidity problems faced by credit card companies during the first quarter of 2003, the Korean government announced temporary measures in April 2003 intended to provide liquidity support to credit card companies. These measures included, among other things, requesting banks and other financial institutions that held debt securities of credit card companies to extend the maturity of such securities and also requesting banks and other financial institutions to make contributions to mutual funds to enable them to purchase debt securities of credit card companies. The Korean government may in the future request financial institutions in Korea, including us, to make investments in or provide other forms of financial support to particular sectors of the Korean economy as a matter of policy, which financial institutions, including us, may decide to accept. We may incur costs or losses as a result of providing such financial support. 27 Table of Contents The Financial Services Commission may impose burdensome measures on us if it deems us or one of our subsidiaries to be financially unsound. If the Financial Services Commission deems our financial condition or the financial condition of our subsidiaries to be unsound, or if we or our subsidiaries fail to meet applicable regulatory standards, such as minimum capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, the Financial Services Commission may order, among other things:  capital increases or reductions;  stock cancellations or consolidations;  transfers of business;  sales of assets;  closures of branch offices;  mergers with other financial institutions; and  suspensions of a part or all of our business operations. If any of these measures are imposed on us by the Financial Services Commission, they could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Financial Services Commission orders us to partially or completely reduce our capital, you may lose part or all of your investment. The recent enactment of the Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act may result in increased competition in the Korean financial services industry. In July 2007, the National Assembly of Korea enacted the Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act, a new law intended to enhance the integration of the Korean capital markets and financial investment products industry. When the Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act becomes effective in February 2009, our subsidiary banks and other banks in Korea may face greater competition in the Korean financial services market from securities companies and other non-bank financial institutions. For example, securities companies currently are not permitted to accept deposits other than for purposes of securities investment by customers and may not provide secondary services in connection with securities investments such as settlement and remittance relating to such deposits. However, under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act, financial investment companies, which will replace the current securities companies, among others, will be able to provide such secondary services. Accordingly, our subsidiary banks and other banks in Korea may experience a loss of customer deposits (which in turn may result in a need to seek alternative funding sources and an increase in our subsidiary banks funding costs), as well as a decrease in our subsidiary banks settlement and remittance service fee income, which may outweigh the benefits to our non-banking subsidiaries under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act. In addition, we believe it is likely that securities companies, as well as asset management companies and other financial industry participants in Korea, will seek to take advantage of the greater flexibility provided under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act to expand their operations in areas that we also plan to develop further, such as investment banking and asset management. As a result, we may face increased competition for customers as well as qualified employees as a result of the implementation of the new law. The Financial Investment Services and Capital Market Act is also likely to result in substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the Korean financial services industry in the near future. This trend toward consolidation and convergence may significantly increase the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors. Some of the financial institutions resulting from this consolidation may, by virtue of their increased size and business scope, provide greater competition for us. 28 Table of Contents Risks relating to Korea Unfavorable financial and economic developments in Korea may have an adverse effect on us. We are incorporated in Korea, and substantially all of our operations are located in Korea. As a result, we are subject to political, economic, legal and regulatory risks specific to Korea. The economic indicators in Korea in recent years have shown mixed signs of growth and uncertainty, and future growth of the economy is subject to many factors beyond our control. Recent developments in the Middle East, including the war in Iraq and its aftermath, higher oil and commodity prices, the general weakness of the U.S. and global economy, the possibility of an outbreak of avian flu in Asia and other parts of the world, and recent difficult conditions and volatility in the U.S. and worldwide credit markets have increased the uncertainty of global economic prospects in general and may continue to adversely affect the Korean economy. Any future deterioration of the Korean or global economy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Developments that could hurt Koreas economy in the future include:  adverse changes or volatility in foreign currency reserve levels, commodity prices (including a further increase in oil prices), exchange rates (including fluctuation of the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen exchange rates or revaluation of the Chinese renminbi), interest rates and stock markets;  substantial decreases in the market prices of Korean real estate;  financial problems or lack of progress in restructuring of Korean conglomerates, other large troubled companies, their suppliers or the financial sector;  loss of investor confidence arising from corporate accounting irregularities and corporate governance issues at certain Korean conglomerates;  a slowdown in consumer spending and the overall economy;  adverse developments in the economies of countries that are important export markets for Korea, such as the United States, Japan and China, or in emerging market economies in Asia or elsewhere;  the continued emergence of the Chinese economy, to the extent its benefits (such as increased exports to China) are outweighed by its costs (such as competition in export markets or for foreign investment and the relocation of the manufacturing base from Korea to China);  social and labor unrest;  a decrease in tax revenues and a substantial increase in the Korean governments expenditures for unemployment compensation and other social programs that, together, would lead to an increased government budget deficit;  the economic impact of any pending or future free trade agreements, including the Free Trade Agreement recently negotiated with the United States;  geo-political uncertainty and risk of further attacks by terrorist groups around the world;  the recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, or an outbreak of avian flu in Asia and other parts of the world;  deterioration in economic or diplomatic relations between Korea and its trading partners or allies, including deterioration resulting from trade disputes or disagreements in foreign policy;  political uncertainty or increasing strife among or within political parties in Korea;  hostilities involving oil producing countries in the Middle East and any material disruption in the supply of oil or increase in the price of oil; and  an increase in the level of tensions or an outbreak of hostilities between North Korea and Korea or the United States. 29 Table of Contents Escalations in tensions with North Korea could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our ADSs. Relations between Korea and North Korea have been tense throughout Koreas modern history. The level of tension between the two Koreas has fluctuated and may increase abruptly as a result of current and future events. In recent years, there have been heightened security concerns stemming from North Koreas nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs and increased uncertainty regarding North Koreas actions and possible responses from the international community. In December 2002, North Korea removed the seals and surveillance equipment from its Yongbyon nuclear power plant and evicted inspectors from the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency. In January 2003, North Korea renounced its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Since the renouncement, Korea, the United States, North Korea, China, Japan and Russia have held numerous rounds of six party multi-lateral talks in an effort to resolve issues relating to North Koreas nuclear weapons program. In addition to conducting test flights of long-range missiles, North Korea announced in October 2006 that it had successfully conducted a nuclear test, which increased tensions in the region and elicited strong objections worldwide. In response, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that prohibits any United Nations member state from conducting transactions with North Korea in connection with any large scale arms and material or technology related to missile development or weapons of mass destruction and from providing luxury goods to North Korea, imposes an asset freeze and travel ban on persons associated with North Koreas weapons program, and calls upon all United Nations member states to take cooperative action, including through inspection of cargo to or from North Korea. In response, North Korea agreed in February 2007 at the six-party talks to shut down and seal the Yongbyon nuclear facility, including the reprocessing facility, and readmit international inspectors to conduct all necessary monitoring and verifications. In October 2007, Korea and North Korea held a summit meeting to discuss easing tensions and fostering peace on the Korean peninsula. Despite these recent initiatives, there can be no assurance that the level of tension on the Korean peninsula will not escalate in the future. In particular, there is no guarantee that the new administration in Korea, which took office in February 2008, will continue the policy on North Korea of the previous administration or that the high-level contacts between Korea and North Korea will continue. Any further increase in tensions, which may occur, for example, if high-level contacts break down or military hostilities occur, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the market value of our common stock and ADSs. Labor unrest in Korea may adversely affect our operations. Any future economic downturn in Korea or an increase in corporate reorganizations and bankruptcies could result in layoffs and higher unemployment. Such developments could lead to social unrest and substantially increase government expenditures for unemployment compensation and other costs for social programs. According to statistics from the Korea National Statistics Office, the unemployment rate increased from 3.6% in 2003 to 3.7% in 2004 and 2005 but decreased to 3.5% in 2006. In 2007, the unemployment rate decreased further to 3.2%. An increase in unemployment and any resulting labor unrest in the future could adversely affect our operations, as well as the operations of many of our customers and their ability to repay their loans, and could adversely affect the financial condition of Korean companies in general, depressing the price of their securities. These developments would likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Financial instability in other countries, particularly emerging market countries in Asia, could adversely impact our business and cause the price of the ADSs to go down. The Korean market and the Korean economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries, particularly emerging market countries in Asia, including China. Financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and elsewhere in the world in the past has adversely affected the Korean economy. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investors reactions to developments in one country can have adverse effects on the 30 Table of Contents securities of companies in other countries, including Korea. A loss of investor confidence in the financial systems of emerging and other markets may cause increased volatility in Korean financial markets. We cannot be certain that financial events of the type that occurred in emerging markets in Asia in 1997 and 1998 will not happen again in Asia or in other markets in which we may invest, or that such events will not have an adverse effect on our business or the price of our common stock and ADSs. Risks relating to our common stock and ADSs The market price of our common stock and ADSs could be depressed by the ability of the KDIC to sell large blocks of our common stock. The KDIC currently owns 588,158,609 shares, or 72.97%, of our outstanding common stock. In the future, the KDIC may choose to sell large blocks of our common stock publicly or privately to a strategic or financial investor, including for the purpose of recovering the public funds it injected into our subsidiaries to recapitalize them. For example, in September 2004, the KDIC sold approximately 45 million of our shares of common stock in a private offering for approximately (Won)324 billion, which constituted 5.7% of our outstanding common stock, and in June 2007, the KDIC disposed of approximately 40 million shares of our common stock, which constituted 5.0% of our outstanding common stock. Under the Financial Holding Company Act, the KDIC was originally required to dispose of all of its holdings of our common stock by the end of March 2005, but the deadline was subsequently extended and then abolished in March 2008 as a result of an amendment to the Financial Holding Company Act. According to the privatization plans announced by the KDIC, the KDIC will seek to dispose of all of its holdings of our common stock through registered or overseas offerings, sales to strategic investors, block sales and other available means, in a manner consistent with its mandate from the Korean government to maximize its returns and contribute to the development of the Korean financial industry in connection with such disposal. However, such plans are subject to change depending on market conditions and other factors. Accordingly, we do not know when, how or what percentage of our shares owned by the KDIC will be disposed of, or to whom such shares will be sold. As a result, we cannot predict the impact of such sales on us or our stock prices. Any future sales of our common stock or ADSs in the public market or otherwise by the KDIC, or the possibility that such sales may occur, could depress the prevailing market prices of our common stock and ADSs. Ownership of our common stock is restricted under Korean law. Under Korean law, a single stockholder, together with its affiliates, is generally prohibited from owning more than 10.0% of the outstanding shares of voting stock of a financial holding company such as us that controls nationwide banks, with the exception of certain stockholders that are non-financial business group companies, whose applicable limit is 4.0%. The Korean government and the KDIC are exempt from this limit, and investors may also exceed the 10.0% limit upon approval by the Financial Services Commission. See Item 4B. Business OverviewSupervision and RegulationPrincipal Regulations Applicable to Financial Holding CompaniesRestrictions on Ownership of a Financial Holding Company. To the extent that the total number of shares of our common stock (including those represented by ADSs) that you and your affiliates own together exceeds the applicable limits, you will not be entitled to exercise the voting rights for the excess shares, and the Financial Services Commission may order you to dispose of the excess shares within a period of up to six months. Failure to comply with such an order would result in an administrative fine of up to (Won)50 million and/or up to 0.03% of the book value of such shares per day until the date of disposal. You will not be able to exercise dissent and appraisal rights unless you have withdrawn the underlying shares of our common stock and become our direct stockholder. In some limited circumstances, including the transfer of the whole or any significant part of our business and the merger or consolidation of us with another company, dissenting stockholders have the right to require us to purchase their shares under Korean law. However, if you hold our ADSs, you will not be able to exercise such 31 Table of Contents dissent and appraisal rights if the depositary refuses to do so on your behalf. Our deposit agreement does not require the depositary to take any action in respect of exercising dissent and appraisal rights. In such a situation, holders of our ADSs must withdraw the underlying common stock from the ADS facility (and incur charges relating to that withdrawal) and become our direct stockholder prior to the record date of the stockholders meeting at which the relevant transaction is to be approved, in order to exercise dissent and appraisal rights. You may be limited in your ability to deposit or withdraw common stock. Under the terms of our deposit agreement, holders of common stock may deposit such stock with the depositarys custodian in Korea and obtain ADSs, and holders of ADSs may surrender ADSs to the depositary and receive common stock. However, to the extent that a deposit of common stock exceeds any limit that we may specify from time to time, that common stock will not be accepted for deposit unless our consent with respect to such deposit has been obtained. We currently have not set any such limit; however, we have the right to do so at any time. Under the terms of the deposit agreement, no consent would be required if the shares of common stock were to be obtained through a dividend, free distribution, rights offering or reclassification of such stock. We have consented, under the terms of the deposit agreement, to any deposit unless the deposit would be prohibited by applicable laws or violate our articles of incorporation. If we choose to impose a limit on deposits in the future, however, we might not consent to the deposit of any additional common stock. In that circumstance, if you surrender ADSs and withdraw common stock, you may not be able to deposit the stock again to obtain ADSs. See Item 9C. MarketsRestrictions Applicable to Shares. You will not have preemptive rights in some circumstances. The Korean Commercial Code of 1962, as amended, and our articles of incorporation require us, with some exceptions, to offer stockholders the right to subscribe for new shares of our common stock in proportion to their existing shareholding ratio whenever new shares are issued. If we offer any rights to subscribe for additional shares of our common stock or any rights of any other nature, the depositary, after consultation with us, may make the rights available to holders of our ADSs or use commercially feasible efforts to dispose of the rights on behalf of such holders, in a riskless principal capacity, and make the net proceeds available to such holders. The depositary will make rights available to holders of our ADSs only if:  we have requested in a timely manner that those rights be made available to such holders;  the depositary has received the documents that are required to be delivered under the terms of the deposit agreement, which may include confirmation that a registration statement filed by us under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is in effect with respect to those shares or that the offering and sale of those shares is exempt from or is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act; and  the depositary determines, after consulting with us, that the distribution of rights is lawful and commercially feasible. Holders of our common stock located in the United States may not exercise any rights they receive absent registration or an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file any registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. If a registration statement is required for you to exercise preemptive rights but is not filed by us or is not declared effective, you will not be able to exercise your preemptive rights for additional ADSs and you will suffer dilution of your equity interest in us. If the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or feasible, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights. 32 Table of Contents Your dividend payments and the amount you may realize upon a sale of your ADSs will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Won. Our common stock is listed on the Stock Market Division of the Korea Exchange and quoted and traded in Won. Cash dividends, if any, in respect of the shares represented by the ADSs will be paid to the depositary in Won and then converted by the depositary into U.S. dollars, subject to certain conditions. Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Won and the U.S. dollar will affect, among other things, the amounts you will receive from the depositary in respect of dividends, the U.S. dollar value of the proceeds that you would receive upon sale in Korea of the shares of our common stock obtained upon surrender of ADSs and the secondary market price of ADSs. Such fluctuations will also affect the U.S. dollar value of dividends and sales proceeds received by holders of our common stock. The market value of your investment may fluctuate due to the volatility of, and government intervention in, the Korean securities market. Our common stock is listed on the Stock Market Division of the Korea Exchange, which has a smaller market capitalization and is more volatile than the securities markets in the United States and many European countries. The market value of ADSs may fluctuate in response to the fluctuation of the trading price of shares of our common stock on the Stock Market Division of the Korea Exchange. The Stock Market Division of the Korea Exchange has experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices and volumes of sales of listed securities and has prescribed a fixed range in which share prices are permitted to move on a daily basis. In the past, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index, known as the KOSPI, reached a peak of 1,138.75 in 1994 and subsequently fell to a low of 280.00 in 1998. On June 23, 2008, the KOSPI closed at 1,715.59. Like other securities markets, including those in developed countries, the Korean securities market has experienced problems including market manipulation, insider trading and settlement failures. The recurrence of these or similar problems could have a material adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the securities of Korean companies, including our common stock and ADSs, in both the domestic and the international markets. The Korean government has the potential ability to exert substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector business community, and in the past has exerted that influence from time to time. For example, the Korean government has induced mergers to reduce what it considers excess capacity in a particular industry and has also induced private companies to publicly offer their securities. Similar actions in the future could have the effect of depressing or boosting the Korean securities market, whether or not intended to do so. Accordingly, actions by the government, or the perception that such actions are taking place, may take place or has ceased, may cause sudden movements in the market prices of the securities of Korean companies in the future, which may affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and ADSs. If the Korean government deems that emergency circumstances are likely to occur, it may restrict you and the depositary from converting and remitting dividends and other amounts in U.S. dollars. If the Korean government deems that certain emergency circumstances, including, but not limited to, severe and sudden changes in domestic or overseas economic circumstances, extreme difficulty in stabilizing the balance of payments or implementing currency, exchange rate and other macroeconomic policies, have occurred or are likely to occur, it may impose certain restrictions provided for under the Foreign Exchange Transaction Law, including the suspension of payments or requiring prior approval from governmental authorities for any transaction. See Item 10D. Exchange ControlsGeneral. Other Risks You may not be able to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against us. We are a corporation with limited liability organized under the laws of Korea. Substantially all of our directors and officers and other persons named in this annual report reside in Korea, and all or a significant 33 Table of Contents portion of the assets of our directors and officers and other persons named in this annual report and substantially all of our assets are located in Korea. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the United States, or to enforce against them or us in the United States judgments obtained in United States courts based on the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability in Korea, either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated on the United States federal securities laws.
