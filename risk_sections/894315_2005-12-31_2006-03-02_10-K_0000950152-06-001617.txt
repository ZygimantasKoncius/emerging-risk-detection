Item 1a. RISK FACTORS The Economic Performance and Value of the Companys Shopping Centers Depend on Many Factors, Each of Which Could Have an Adverse Impact on Its Cash Flows and Operating Results The economic performance and value of the Companys real estate holdings can be affected by many factors, including the following:  Changes in the national, regional and local economic climate;  Local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;  The attractiveness of the properties to tenants;  Competition from other available space;  The Companys ability to provide adequate management services and to maintain its properties;  Increased operating costs, if these costs cannot be passed through to tenants and  The expense of periodically renovating, repairing and reletting spaces. The Companys properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and, therefore, its performance is linked to general economic conditions in the market for retail space. The market for retail space has been and may continue to be adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies, the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies, the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector, the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the Internet. To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to affect market rents for retail space. In addition, the Company may face challenges in the management and maintenance of the properties or encounter increased operating costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, which may make its properties unattractive to tenants. The loss of rental revenues from a number of the Companys tenants and its inability to replace such tenants may adversely affect the Companys profitability and ability to meet its debt and other financial obligations and make distributions to the shareholders. The Companys Dependence on Rental Income May Adversely Affect Its Ability to Meet Its Debt Obligations and Make Distributions to the Shareholders Substantially all of the Companys income is derived from rental income from real property. As a result, the Companys performance depends on its ability to collect rent from tenants. The Companys income and funds for distribution would be negatively affected if a significant number of its tenants, or any of its major tenants (as discussed in more detail below):  Experience a downturn in their business that significantly weakens their ability to meet their obligations to the Company; 6 Table of Contents  Delay lease commencements;  Decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration;  Fail to make rental payments when due or  Close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. Lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could also result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. In addition, the Company cannot be sure that any tenant whose lease expires will renew that lease or that it will be able to re-lease space on economically advantageous terms. The loss of rental revenues from a number of the Companys tenants and its inability to replace such tenants may adversely affect the Companys profitability and its ability to meet debt and other financial obligations and make distributions to the shareholders. The Company Relies on Major Tenants, Making It Vulnerable to Changes in the Business and Financial Condition of, or Demand for Its Space by, Such Tenants As of December 31, 2005, the annualized base rental revenues from Wal-Mart, Tops Market (Royal Ahold), Mervyns, PETsMART, TJ Maxx, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohls and Lowes represented 5.4%, 3.1%, 2.8%, 2.0%, 1.9%, 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.7%, respectively, of the Companys aggregate annualized shopping center base rental revenues, including its proportionate share of joint venture aggregate annualized shopping center base rental revenues. The Companys income and ability to meet its financial obligations could be adversely affected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or a significant downturn in the business of, one of these tenants or any of the Companys other major tenants. In addition, the Companys results could be adversely affected if any of these tenants does not renew multiple lease terms as they expire. The Companys Acquisition Activities May Not Produce the Cash Flows That It Expects and May Be Limited by Competitive Pressures or Other Factors The Company intends to acquire existing retail properties to the extent that suitable acquisitions can be made on advantageous terms. Acquisitions of commercial properties entail risks such as:  The Companys estimates on expected occupancy and rental rates may differ from actual conditions;  The Companys estimates of the costs of any redevelopment or repositioning of acquired properties may prove to be inaccurate;  The Company may be unable to operate successfully in new markets where acquired properties are located, due to a lack of market knowledge or understanding of local economies;  The Company may be unable to successfully integrate new properties into its existing operations; or  The Company may have difficulty obtaining financing on acceptable terms or paying the operating expenses and debt service associated with acquired properties prior to sufficient occupancy. In addition, the Company may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on advantageous terms due to competition for such properties with others engaged in real estate investment who may have greater financial resources than the Company. The Companys inability to successfully acquire new properties may affect the Companys ability to achieve anticipated return on investment, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. The Companys Articles of Incorporation Contain Limitations on Acquisitions and Changes in Control In order to maintain the Companys status as a REIT, its articles of incorporation prohibit any person, except for certain existing shareholders at the time of its initial public offering, from owning more than 5% of the Companys outstanding common shares. This restriction is likely to discourage third parties from acquiring 7 Table of Contents control of DDR without consent of its board of directors even if a change in control was in the interest of shareholders. Real Estate Property Investments Are Illiquid, and Therefore the Company May Not Be Able to Dispose of Properties When Appropriate or on Favorable Terms Real estate property investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly. In addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on the ability of a REIT to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. Therefore, the Company may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms, which could cause the Company to incur extended losses and reduce its cash flows and adversely affect distributions to shareholders. The Companys Development and Construction Activities Could Affect Its Operating Results The Company intends to continue the selective development and construction of retail properties in accordance with its development and underwriting policies as opportunities arise. The Companys development and construction activities include risks that:  The Company may abandon development opportunities after expending resources to determine feasibility;  Construction costs of a project may exceed the Companys original estimates;  Occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable;  Rental rates per square foot could be less than projected;  Financing may not be available to the Company on favorable terms for development of a property;  The Company may not complete construction and lease-up on schedule, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and  The Company may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that the Company may have to wait years for a significant cash return. If any of the above events occur, the development of properties may hinder the Companys growth and have an adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, new development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, typically require substantial time and attention from management. The Company Has Variable Rate Debt and Is Subject to Interest Rate Risk The Company has a substantial amount of mortgage debt with interest rates that vary depending upon the market index. In addition, the Company has a revolving credit facility that bears interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility. The Company may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase the Companys interest expense, which would adversely affect net earnings and cash available for payment of its debt obligations and distributions to the shareholders. The Companys Ability to Increase Its Debt Could Adversely Affect Its Cash Flow At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding debt of approximately $3.9 billion (excluding its proportionate share of joint venture mortgage debt aggregating $510.5 million). The Company intends to continue to maintain a conservative debt capitalization with a ratio of debt to total market capitalization (the sum of the aggregate market value of the Companys common shares, the liquidation preference on any preferred shares outstanding and its total indebtedness) of less than 50%. In addition, the Company is subject to limitations under its credit facilities and indentures relating to its ability to incur further debt; however, the Companys organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount or percentage of indebtedness it may incur. 8 Table of Contents If the Company were to become more highly leveraged, its cash needs to fund debt service would increase accordingly. Under such circumstances, the Companys risk of decreases in cash flow, due to fluctuations in the real estate market, reliance on its major tenants, acquisition and development costs and the other factors discussed above could subject the Company to an even greater adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased leverage could increase the risk of default on the Companys debt obligations, which could further reduce its cash available for distribution and adversely affect its ability to dispose of its portfolio on favorable terms, which could cause the Company to incur extended losses and reduce its cash flows. The Companys Cash Flows and Operating Results Could Be Adversely Affected by Required Payments of Debt or Related Interest and Other Risks of Its Debt Financing The Company is generally subject to risks associated with debt financing. These risks include:  The Companys cash flow may not satisfy required payments of principal and interest;  The Company may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness on its properties as necessary or the terms of the refinancing may be less favorable to the Company than the terms of existing debt;  Required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines;  Debt service obligations could reduce funds available for distribution to the Companys shareholders and funds available for acquisitions;  Any default on the Companys indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure and  The risk that necessary capital expenditures for purposes such as re-leasing space cannot be financed on favorable terms. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and the Company cannot make the mortgage payments, it may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property. Any of these risks can place strains on the Companys cash flows, reduce its ability to grow and adversely affect its results of operations. The Companys Financial Condition Could Be Adversely Affected by Financial Covenants The Companys credit facilities and the indentures under which its senior and subordinated unsecured indebtedness is, or may be, issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on the Companys ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness, sell all or substantially all of its assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. These covenants could limit the Companys ability to obtain additional funds needed to address cash shortfalls or pursue growth opportunities or transactions that would provide substantial return to its shareholders. In addition, a breach of these covenants could cause a default under or accelerate some or all of the Companys indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. The Companys Ability to Continue to Obtain Permanent Financing Cannot Be Assured In the past, the Company has financed certain acquisitions and certain development activities in part with proceeds from its credit facilities or offerings of its debt securities. These financings have been, and may continue to be, replaced by more permanent financing. However, the Company may not be able to obtain more permanent financing for future acquisitions or development activities on acceptable terms. If market interest rates were to increase or other unfavorable market conditions exist at a time when amounts were outstanding under the Companys credit facilities, or if other variable rate debt was outstanding, the Companys debt interest costs would increase, causing potentially adverse effects on its financial condition and results of operations. 9 Table of Contents If the Company Fails to Qualify as a REIT in Any Taxable Year, It Will Be Subject to U.S. Federal Income Tax as a Regular Corporation and Could Have Significant Tax Liability The Company intends to operate in a manner that allows it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, REIT qualification requires that the Company satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual or quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for which there are a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations. The Companys status as a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that are not entirely within its control. Accordingly, it is not certain the Company will be able to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even a technical or inadvertent violation of the REIT requirements could jeopardize the Companys REIT qualification. Furthermore, Congress or the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, might change the tax laws or regulations and the courts might issue new rulings, in each case potentially having retroactive effect that could make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to qualify as a REIT. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any tax year, then:  the Company would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation, which, among other things, means that it would be unable to deduct distributions to its shareholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates;  any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders, and could force the Company to liquidate assets or take other actions that could have a detrimental effect on its operating results; and  unless the Company was entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, it would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the Company lost its qualification, and its cash available for distribution to its shareholders therefore would be reduced for each of the years in which the Company does not qualify as a REIT. Even if the Company remains qualified as a REIT, it may face other tax liabilities that reduce its cash flow. The Company may also be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on its income and property either directly or at the level of its subsidiaries. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to the Companys shareholders. Compliance with REIT Requirements May Negatively Affect the Companys Operating Decisions To maintain its status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company must meet certain requirements, on an on-going basis, including requirements regarding its sources of income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts the Company distributes to its shareholders and the ownership of its shares. The Company may also be required to make distributions to its shareholders when it does not have funds readily available for distribution or at times when the Companys funds are otherwise needed to fund capital expenditures. As a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 90% of its annual net taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to its shareholders. To the extent that the Company satisfies this distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that it pays to its shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. From time to time, the Company may generate taxable income greater than its income for financial reporting purposes, or its net taxable income may be greater than its cash flow available for distribution to its shareholders. If the Company does not have other funds available in these situations, it could be required to borrow funds, sell a portion of its securities at unfavorable prices or find other sources of funds in order to meet the REIT distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax. In addition, the REIT provisions of the Code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. Prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. This 100% tax could impact the Companys decisions to sell property if it believes such sales could be treated as a 10 Table of Contents prohibited transaction. However, the Company would not be subject to this tax if it were to sell assets through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The Company will also be subject to a 100% tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements between the Company and a taxable REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. Dividends Paid by REITs Generally Do Not Qualify for Reduced Tax Rates In general, the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual U.S. shareholders is 15% (through 2008). Unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a REIT, the Companys distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Property Ownership Through Partnerships and Joint Ventures Could Limit the Companys Control of Those Investments and Reduce Its Expected Return Partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by the Company, including the possibility that the Companys partner or co-venturer might become bankrupt, that its partner or co-venturer might at any time have different interests or goals than the Company, and that its partner or co-venturer may take action contrary to the Companys instructions, requests, policies or objectives, including the Companys policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a REIT. Other risks of joint venture investments include impasse on decisions, such as a sale, because neither the Companys partner or co-venturer nor the Company would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. These factors could limit the return that the Company receives from such investments or cause its cash flows to be lower than its estimates. There is no limitation under the Companys amended and restated articles of incorporation, or its code of regulations as to the amount of funds that the Company may invest in partnerships or joint ventures. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $275.1 million of investments in and advances to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures holding 163 operating shopping centers. The Companys Inability to Realize the Anticipated Returns from Its Retail Real Estate Assets Outside the United States Could Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations The Company may not realize the intended benefits of the transactions outside the United States as the Company may not have any prior experience with local economies or culture. The assets may not perform as well as the Company anticipated or may not be successfully integrated, or the Company may not realize the improvements in occupancy and operating results that it anticipated. In addition, the Company could be subject to local laws governing these properties, with which it has no prior experience, and which may present new challenges for the management of the Companys operations. Each of these factors may adversely affect the Companys ability to achieve anticipated return on investment, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. The Companys Real Estate Investments May Contain Environmental Risks That Could Adversely Affect Its Operating Results The acquisition of certain of the assets may subject the Company to liabilities, including environmental liabilities. The Companys operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to the cost of complying with existing or future environmental laws and regulations. In addition, under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the Company may be considered an owner or operator of real property or to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. As a result, the Company may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its property. The Company may also be liable for other potential costs that could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). The Company may incur such liability whether or not it knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Such liability could be of substantial magnitude and divert managements attention from other aspects of the Companys business and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial condition, as well as its ability to make distributions to the shareholders. 11 Table of Contents An Uninsured Loss or a Loss That Exceeds the Policies on the Companys Properties Could Subject the Company to Lost Capital or Revenue on Those Properties Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on the Companys properties, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of the Company or its agents. Additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenants expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and full replacement value property damage insurance policies. The Company has obtained comprehensive liability, casualty, flood and rental loss insurance policies on the properties. All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions. In addition, the Company cannot assure the shareholders that the tenants will properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles. Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, the Company could lose all or part of its capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial condition, as well as its ability to make distributions to the shareholders. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Fire, Safety and Other Regulations May Require the Company to Make Unintended Expenditures That Adversely Affect the Companys Cash Flows All of the Companys properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, (ADA). The ADA has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities, but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. While the tenants to whom the Company leases properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. As a result, the Company could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, the Company is required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to the properties. The Company may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements, and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on its ability to meet the financial obligations and make distributions to the shareholders. Changes in Market Conditions Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of the Companys Publicly Traded Securities As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of the Companys publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of the Companys publicly traded securities are the following:  The extent of institutional investor interest in the Company;  The reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with similar portfolios;  The attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);  The Companys financial condition and performance;  The markets perception of the Companys growth potential and potential future cash dividends; 12 Table of Contents  An increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for the Companys shares and  General economic and financial market conditions. The Company Can Issue Additional Securities Without Shareholder Approval The Company can issue preferred, equity and common stock without shareholder approval subject to certain limitations in the Companys articles of incorporation. Holders of preferred stock have priority over holders of common stock, and the issuance of additional shares of stock reduces the interest of existing holders in the Company. The Companys Executive Officers Have Agreements That Provide Them with Benefits in the Event of a Change in Control of the Company or if Their Employment Agreements are Not Renewed The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers that provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends under certain circumstances following a change in control of the Company or if the Company terminates the executive officer without cause as defined in the employment agreements. These benefits could increase the cost to a potential acquirer of the Company and thereby prevent or deter a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise affect the interests of the shareholders. Item 1b. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Item 2. PROPERTIES At December 31, 2005, the Portfolio Properties included 469 shopping centers (163 of which are owned through unconsolidated joint ventures) and seven business centers. The shopping centers consist of 448 community shopping centers, 17 enclosed mini-malls and four lifestyle centers. The Portfolio Properties also include over 560 undeveloped acres primarily located adjacent to certain of the shopping centers. The shopping centers aggregate approximately 81.6 million square feet of Company-owned GLA (approximately 104.3 million square feet of total GLA) and are located in 44 states, plus Puerto Rico, principally in the East and Midwest, with significant concentrations in New York, Florida and Ohio. The business centers aggregate 0.8 million square feet of Company-owned GLA and are located in five states, primarily in Texas. The Companys shopping centers are designed to attract local area customers and are typically anchored by two or more national tenant anchors and often include a supermarket, drug store, junior department store and/or other major category-killer discount retailers as additional anchors. The shopping centers are typically anchored by a Wal-Mart, Kohls or Target. The tenants of the shopping centers typically offer day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items. As one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers, many of which occupy space in the shopping centers. Shopping centers make up the largest portion of the Companys portfolio, comprising 74.9 million (91.8%) square feet of Company-owned GLA. Enclosed mini-malls account for 5.1 million (6.3%) square feet of Company-owned GLA, and the lifestyle centers account for 1.6 million (1.9%) square feet of the Company-owned GLA. On December 31, 2005, the average annualized base rent per square foot of Company-owned GLA of the Companys 269 wholly-owned shopping centers was $10.42, and those 200 owned through joint ventures, 37 of which are consolidated assets, was $12.05. The average annualized base rent per square foot of the Companys business centers was $10.51. 13 Table of Contents Information as to tenants that individually accounted for at least 1.0% of total annualized base rent of the Companys properties at December 31, 2005, is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, unless otherwise indicated, with respect to the 469 shopping centers:  137 of these properties are anchored by a Wal-Mart, Kohls or Target store;  These properties range in size from 10,000 square feet to approximately 1,100,000 square feet of total GLA (with 70 properties exceeding 400,000 square feet of total GLA);  Approximately 64.6% of the Company-owned GLA of these properties is leased to national tenants, including subsidiaries, approximately 21.5% of the Company-owned GLA is leased to regional tenants and approximately 9.2% of the Company-owned GLA is leased to local tenants;  Approximately 95.3% of the aggregate Company-owned GLA of these properties was occupied as of December 31, 2005. (With respect to the properties owned by the Company at December 31, for each of the five years beginning with 2001, between 94.3% and 95.7% of aggregate Company-owned GLA of these properties was occupied);  Eight wholly-owned properties are currently being expanded by the Company, and three properties owned by joint ventures are being expanded. The Company is pursuing the expansion of one additional wholly-owned property and two joint venture properties and  Eight wholly-owned properties and three joint venture properties are currently being developed by the Company.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES The high and low sale prices per share of the Companys common shares, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) composite tape, and declared dividends per share for the quarterly periods indicated were as follows: High Low Dividends 2005: First $ 44.50 $ 38.74 $ 0.54 Second 47.59 38.91 0.54 Third 49.49 43.87 0.54 Fourth 48.29 42.03 0.54 2004: First $ 40.89 $ 32.26 $ 0.46 Second 42.55 30.80 0.46 Third 39.15 35.09 0.51 Fourth 45.85 39.05 0.51 As of February 15, 2006, there were 2,570 record holders and approximately 31,000 beneficial owners of the Companys common shares. On February 15, 2006, the Company declared its 2006 first quarter dividend, payable on April 3, 2006, to shareholders of record on March 22, 2006, of $0.59 per share. The Company intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on its common shares. However, no assurances can be made as to the amounts of future dividends, since such dividends are subject to the Companys cash flow from operations, earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors the Board of Directors considers relevant. The Company is required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income. The amount of cash available for dividends is impacted by capital expenditures and debt service requirements to the extent that the Company were to fund such items out of cash flow from operations. In June 1995, the Company implemented a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividends automatically in common shares. Under the plan, the Company may, from time to time, elect to purchase common shares in the open market on behalf of participating shareholders or may issue new common shares to such shareholders. The Company does not currently have in effect a plan to repurchase its common shares in the open market and did not repurchase any shares during 2005. 52 Table of Contents Item 6.

average shares and OP Units (Diluted) (3) 110,700 99,147 84,319 65,910 56,957 (1) As described in the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired 52 properties in 2005 (including 36 of which were acquired through a joint venture and one by acquiring its joint venture partners interest), 112 properties in 2004 (including 18 of which were acquired through joint ventures and one by acquiring its joint venture partners interest), 124 properties in 2003 (three of which are owned through joint ventures), 11 properties in 2002 (four by acquiring its joint venture partners interest), and eight properties in 2001 (all of which are owned through joint ventures). In addition, in conjunction with the AIP merger in May 2001 the Company obtained ownership of 39 properties. As of December 31, 2005, the Company disposed of 32 of these properties. The Company sold 47 properties in 2005 (12 of which were owned through joint ventures), 28 properties in 2004 (13 of which were owned through joint ventures), 38 properties in 2003 (12 of which were owned through joint ventures), 15 properties in 2002 (six of which were owned through joint ventures), and ten properties in 2001 (three of which were owned through joint ventures). All amounts have been presented to reflect the Companys adoption of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2002 as appropriate. In accordance with that standard, long-lived assets that were sold or are classified as held for sale as a result of disposal activities initiated subsequent to December 31, 2001 have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. (2) Management believes that Funds From Operations (FFO), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess the financial performance of a REIT. It is frequently used by securities analysts, 55 Table of Contents investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. FFO available to common shareholders is generally defined and calculated by the Company as net income, adjusted to exclude: (i) preferred dividends, (ii) gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable real estate property, except for those sold through the Companys merchant building program, which are presented net of taxes, (iii) sales of securities, (iv) extraordinary items, (v) cumulative effect of adoption of new accounting standards and (vi) certain non-cash items. These non-cash items principally include real property depreciation, equity income from joint ventures and equity income from minority equity investments and adding the Companys proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures and minority equity investments, determined on a consistent basis. Management believes that FFO provides the Company and investors with an important indicator of the Companys operating performance. This measure of performance is used by the Company for several business purposes and for REITs it provides a recognized measure of performance other than GAAP net income, which may include non-cash items (often large). Other real estate companies may calculate FFO in a different manner. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (3) Represents weighted average shares and operating partnership units, or OP Units, at the end of the respective period. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements, including trends that might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. The Company considers portions of this information to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, with respect to the Companys expectations for future periods. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements related to acquisitions (including any related pro forma financial information) and other business development activities, future capital expenditures, financing sources and availability and the effects of environmental and other regulations. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in those forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact should be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects, seeks, estimates, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Readers should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond the Companys control and could materially affect the Companys actual results, performance or achievements. Factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:  The Company is subject to general risks affecting the real estate industry, including the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms to generate rental revenues;  The Company could be adversely affected by changes in the local markets where its properties are located, as well as by adverse changes in national economic and market conditions;  The Company may fail to anticipate the effects on its properties of changes in consumer buying practices, including sales over the Internet and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of its tenants;  The Company is subject to competition for tenants from other owners of retail properties, and its tenants are subject to competition from other retailers and methods of distribution. The Company is dependent upon the successful operations and financial condition of its tenants, in particular certain of its major tenants, and could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of those tenants;  The Company may not realize the intended benefits of an acquisition transaction. The assets may not perform as well as the Company anticipated or the Company may not successfully integrate the assets and realize the improvements in occupancy and operating results that the Company anticipates. The acquisition of certain assets may subject the Company to liabilities, including environmental liabilities;  The Company may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties that produce a desired yield on invested capital, or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties. In addition, the Company may be limited in its acquisition opportunities due to competition and other factors;  The Company may fail to dispose of properties on favorable terms. In addition, real estate investments can be illiquid and limit the Companys ability to promptly make changes to its portfolio to respond to economic and other conditions;  The Company may abandon a development opportunity after expending resources if it determines that the development opportunity is not feasible or if it is unable to obtain all necessary zoning and other required governmental permits and authorizations;  The Company may not complete projects on schedule as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control, such as weather, labor conditions and material shortages, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and decreases in revenue; 57 Table of Contents  The Companys financial condition may be affected by required payments of debt or related interest, the risk of default and the restrictions on its ability to incur additional debt or enter into certain transactions under its credit facilities and other documents governing its debt obligations. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining permanent financing;  Debt and/or equity financing necessary for the Company to continue to grow and operate its business may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms;  The Company is subject to complex regulations related to its status as a real estate investment trust (REIT) and would be adversely affected if it failed to qualify as a REIT;  The Company must make distributions to shareholders to continue to qualify as a REIT, and if the Company borrows funds to make distributions, those borrowings may not be available on favorable terms;  Partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by the Company, including the possibility that the Companys partner or co-venturer might become bankrupt, that the Companys partner or co-venturer might at any time have different interests or goals than does the Company and that the Companys partner or co-venturer may take action contrary to the Companys instructions, requests, policies or objectives, including the Companys policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a REIT;  The Company may not realize anticipated returns from its real estate assets outside of the United States due to factors such as its lack of experience with the local economy, culture and laws;  The Company is subject to potential environmental liabilities;  The Company may incur losses that are uninsured or exceed policy coverage due to its liability for certain injuries to persons, property or the environment occurring on its properties;  The Company could incur additional expenses in order to comply with or respond to claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act or otherwise be adversely affected by changes in government regulations, including changes in environmental, zoning, tax and other regulations and  Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market price for the Companys common shares, as well as its performance and cash flow. Executive Summary The Companys mission statement is to be the leading owner, developer and manager of market-dominant open-air community shopping centers. The Company believes that this format provides the best environment for the nations most successful retailers, by offering consumers the most convenient shopping experience at an affordable cost. These large retail properties draw shoppers from the immediate neighborhood as well as the surrounding trade area and typically have the following characteristics:  250,000-1,000,000 square foot, open-air shopping centers;  Two or more strong national tenant anchors such as Wal-Mart, Kohls, Target, Home Depot or Lowes Home Improvement;  Two or more medium-sized national big-box tenants such as Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, TJ Maxx or Michaels;  20,000 - 80,000 square feet of small shops and  Two to four outparcels available for sale or ground lease. Despite changes in the overall economy, retail sales over the last 11 years have grown by more than 70% and, according to the U.S. Census, are expected to continue growing at an annual rate of approximately 5%. As retail sales continue to grow, the Company believes it is well-positioned to benefit from shoppers preferences for an open-air retail format compared to an enclosed mall format, as well as consumers shift from shopping at traditional department stores in favor of specialized category killers and general merchandise discounters. 58 Table of Contents The Company believes that the current retail environment is of a fluid nature. As such, tenant portfolio reviews, which consist of analysis of each of the Companys real estate assets, continue to be a major priority of the Companys leasing team in order to stay current on tenant demands and new store prototypes while continually introducing tenants to the opportunities within the Companys portfolio. Several tenants are migrating from the regional mall environment and establishing new store prototypes suitable for the Companys various open-air formats. These tenants include: Abercrombie & Fitch American Eagle Ann Taylor Ann Taylor Loft Banana Republic Bath & Body Works Body Shop Bombay Chicos Childrens Place C.J. Banks Claires Coach Coldwater Creek Express GameStop Gap Gymboree Hallmark The Jones Store J. Jill The Limited Limited Too Liz Claiborne Mimi Maternity Motherhood Maternity Old Navy Petite Sophisticate Pier 1 Imports Pottery Barn Sephora Soma Structure Talbots Tommy Bahama Victorias Secret West Elm White House/ Black Market Williams-Sonoma Wilsons, The Leather Experts Yankee Candle Zales In addition, as shoppers have migrated from traditional department stores to general merchandise discounters and home improvement category killers  which reflect many of the Companys largest tenants (Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Target, Kohls, Lowes Home Improvement, Costco and Kohls)  these tenants have grown to represent a significantly larger aggregate market capitalization, based on shares outstanding and share price as traded on the New York Stock Exchange, than that of traditional department stores. 59 Table of Contents As a result of these long-term retail trends, portfolio fundamentals have remained consistently strong and resilient to fluctuations in the national economy, store closings and tenant bankruptcies. The following table sets forth information as to anchor and/or national retail tenants that individually accounted for at least 1.0% of total annualized base rent of the wholly-owned properties and the Companys proportionate share of joint venture properties as of December 31, 2005: % of Total % of Total Shopping Center Shopping Center Tenant Base Rent GLA Wal-Mart 5.4 % 9.0 % Tops Market (Royal Ahold) 3.1 % 2.8 % Mervyns 2.8 % 2.5 % PETsMART 2.0 % 1.6 % TJ Maxx/ Marshalls 1.9 % 2.1 % Bed Bath & Beyond 1.7 % 1.5 % Kohls 1.7 % 2.4 % Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse 1.7 % 2.7 % Home Depot 1.3 % 1.6 % Michaels 1.3 % 1.1 % OfficeMax 1.3 % 1.2 % Sears 1.3 % 3.6 % The Gap/ Old Navy 1.2 % 0.8 % Barnes & Noble 1.1 % 0.7 % AMC Theatres 1.0 % 0.4 % Best Buy 1.0 % 0.8 % Dicks Sporting Goods 1.0 % 0.9 % Ross Dress For Less 1.0 % 1.0 % Staples 1.0 % 0.9 % 60 Table of Contents The following table sets forth information as to anchor and/or national retail tenants that individually accounted for at least 1.0% of total annualized base rent of the 269 wholly-owned properties and the Companys 200 joint venture properties, 37 of which are consolidated assets, as of December 31, 2005: Wholly-owned Properties Joint Venture Properties % of % of % of % of Shopping Company- Shopping Company- Center Base owned Center Base owned Rental Shopping Rental Shopping Tenant Revenues Center GLA Revenues Center GLA Wal-Mart 6.1 % 10.1 % 2.0 % 3.3 % Tops Market (Royal Ahold) 3.4 % 2.9 % 3.1 % 3.4 % Lowes Home Improvement 1.9 % 3.0 % 1.0 % 1.3 % PETsMART 1.9 % 1.4 % 2.7 % 2.5 % Bed Bath & Beyond 1.7 % 1.4 % 2.1 % 2.0 % TJ Maxx/ Marshalls 1.7 % 2.0 % 3.9 % 3.8 % Kohls 1.6 % 2.3 % 2.6 % 4.0 % Sears 1.5 % 4.1 % 0.3 % 0.7 % Home Depot 1.4 % 1.7 % 0.7 % 0.8 % The Gap/ Old Navy 1.2 % 0.8 % 1.4 % 1.1 % Michaels 1.2 % 1.0 % 1.5 % 1.6 % OfficeMax 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.7 % 1.7 % Best Buy 1.0 % 0.7 % 1.4 % 1.4 % Dicks Sporting 1.0 % 0.9 % 1.1 % 1.1 % Dollar Tree 1.0 % 1.1 % 0.5 % 0.7 % Staples 1.0 % 0.9 % 0.5 % 0.3 % AMC Theatre 0.9 % 0.3 % 1.8 % 1.2 % Barnes & Noble/ B.

Because the Company can develop property at cash-on-cost yields that are significantly greater than income yields based on current market pricing, property development offers the greatest opportunity to create shareholder value. Consequently, the Company maintains a significant development pipeline consisting of projects under construction and potential new developments, which it believes will generate long-term value creation and, ultimately, income growth. The Company believes that it is uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the market because of its development competencies. The Company has an established track record of 61 Table of Contents successfully completing a variety of different types of developments, including new ground-up community center and lifestyle center developments, mixed use developments in urban markets, redevelopment of existing properties and conversion of enclosed regional malls to open-air community centers. Another important component of the Companys business model is its continued focus on its financial position and ability to access capital, which include the following objectives:  Maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility through the use of multiple sources of public and private capital to create growth;  Accessing equity capital through joint ventures with institutional investors, which provides an efficient means to access private funds while also receiving a promoted return on the Companys investments;  Managing the Companys exposure to interest rate and refinancing risk by executing disciplined financial transactions. At December 31, 2005, the Companys total market capitalization (market capitalization is defined as common shares and OP Units outstanding multiplied by the closing price of the common shares on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2005, of $47.02, plus preferred shares at liquidation value and consolidated debt) was $9.8 billion as compared to $8.3 billion at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, the Company owns or has an interest in and manages 469 retail operating and development properties in 44 states plus Puerto Rico comprising approximately 81.6 million square feet of GLA. In addition, the Company owns or has an interest in seven office and industrial properties in five states comprising approximately 0.8 million square feet of GLA. Year in Review  2005 The Companys portfolio continues to demonstrate strong leasing fundamentals, which reflect both the growing strength of the Companys asset class and the quality of the Companys portfolio. Moreover, the Company continued to structure and execute transactions during the year that support the Companys investment strategy and result in long-term value creation for shareholders. Several of the significant accomplishments are as follows: Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $282.6 million, or $2.08 per share (diluted), compared to net income of $269.8 million, or $2.24 per share (diluted) for the prior comparable period. FFO applicable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $355.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 of $292.3 million, an increase of 21.5%. The increase in net income of approximately $12.8 million is due to (i) increases in Net Operating Income from operating properties, (ii) increases in 2005 operations which include the acquisition of assets from Benderson Development Company, Inc. (Benderson) in 2004, the acquisition of assets from Caribbean Property Group (CPG) in January 2005 (CPG Properties), and the acquisition of the underlying real estate of operating Mervyns stores through a joint venture interest (Mervyns Joint Venture) in September 2005, offset by (iii) gains on sale of real estate and changes in accounting principles, (iv) increases in depreciation of the assets acquired and developed, (v) decreases in operations from the strategic disposition of non-core assets, (vi) increase in short-term interest rates and related interest expense associated with borrowings used to finance acquisitions and (vii) decreases in equity in net income as a result of a reduction in asset sales. The decrease in net income per share is attributable to the full year of dilution associated with the common share issuances in May and December 2004 relating to the above mentioned acquisitions, offset by the income generated from the factors described above. The Companys growth in net income was primarily attributable to the continued improvement in occupancy and rental rates, as well as the portfolio acquisition in Puerto Rico earlier this year. It is particularly important to recognize that this growth was also achieved in spite of a nearly 200 basis point increase in average short term interest rates. DDRs core revenue business had a positive year. The Company believes the year 2005 was an exceptional year in terms of opportunities for expansion of the Companys operating platform, outstanding tenant demand for space and strengthening of portfolio fundamentals. When coupled with the Companys development program, the prospect for solid fundamentals and future growth remains strong. 62 Table of Contents The Companys portfolio in Puerto Rico has outperformed the Companys expectations. Although the portfolio has remained approximately 98% leased since the acquisition in January 2005, the leasing spreads were large for those tenants that had leases expire in 2005. Excluding seasonal tenants, carts and kiosks, rents on new leases increased on average by more than 30%, which also reflect the rate on renewals since options are not granted by landlords in Puerto Rico. During 2005, the Company sold nearly $600 million of wholly-owned and joint venture assets, generating significant funds for reinvestment. Included in this amount are approximately $348.0 million of assets sold to the MDT Joint Venture, $35.7 million of non-core assets and $168.2 million of assets that were held in joint ventures. The Company also sold 25 office and industrial assets for $177.0 million. Aggregate sales of wholly-owned properties generated $104.8 million in gains, of which $58.8 million was not included in FFO. In addition, sales of unconsolidated joint venture assets generated $49.8 million in gains based on the Companys proportionate share, of which $19.0 million were not included in FFO. The Company recognized gains of approximately $13.0 million relating to its ownership in joint venture assets. During 2005, the Company also focused efforts to improve its capital structure. In the public debt arena, the Company took advantage of the favorable pricing environment and issued a total of $200 million of five-year, $350 million of seven-year and $200 million of ten-year unsecured debt in 2005. The proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of CPG Properties and repay balances on the Companys senior unsecured credit facility. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $150 million outstanding on its $1 billion senior unsecured credit facility. The level of variable rate debt is consistent with year-end 2004, demonstrating that, although large transactions may create short-term changes in the Companys balance sheet, the Company has continued to demonstrate its ability to make adjustments to its capital structure to maintain the balance sheet with consistent financial ratios. At December 31, 2005, the Companys variable debt represented 20.9% of the Companys total indebtedness of approximately $3.9 billion. In 2005, the Company obtained a $220 million term loan that is collateralized by equity in certain assets already encumbered by low-leverage first mortgage debt. This term loan provides the Company with low cost capital without the need to mortgage additional assets; provides proceeds to pay down the senior unsecured facility; improves unencumbered asset ratios, which are important to corporate bondholders and rating agencies; and provides additional liquidity on the senior unsecured facility in order to take advantage of future business opportunities. In addition to the Companys consolidated debt, the Company and its partners are very proactive in managing the capital structure of its joint ventures. In 2005, several mortgages were refinanced, resulting in meaningful incremental proceeds and lower interest rates. The Company expects that it and its partners will continue to be as proactive with joint venture capital as with the consolidated portfolio. The Companys ability to successfully deliver on stated goals was recognized by the rating agencies during 2005, resulting in improved senior unsecured debt ratings. The Companys development pipeline has several potential opportunities. These development projects are possible as a result of strong tenant demand and an effective site selection discipline that is consistent with the needs of the Companys tenant community. Moreover, in spite of increased costs and fluctuations within the product supply chain for construction materials, the Company has been able to maintain an approximate 11% cash-on-cost yield requirement by being prudent in the selection of locations, understanding the markets, and driving tenant transactions to the appropriate economic levels. At the same time, the Company has remained disciplined with budgeting and planning including providing for adequate contingencies to handle unforeseen price fluctuations. One area that the Company is watching very closely is the proliferation of public-to-private or private-to-private transactions that have occurred over the last 12 months as a result of available private equity funds to facilitate such transactions. Certain tenants have recapitalized their companies either through a public-to-private transaction or by avoiding the public markets altogether and recapitalizing in a private equity transaction with third-party private capital. A significant issue could be the loss of transparency enjoyed by landlords in regard to tenants that were once public but now private. Due to its size and platform, the Company can mitigate that risk via access to information through a national account program. However, these types of transactions are a trend in 63 Table of Contents the industry that the Company must continue to monitor because many private retailers view privatization as a competitive advantage. For 2006, the Company anticipates continued growth in its portfolio, driven by a growing roster of tenants seeking new locations in open-air shopping centers. The Company expects that the acquisition environment will remain extremely competitive and that capitalization rates will reflect this demand. The Company anticipates, however, that capital will become scarcer, causing a bifurcation in the market between those investors with access to funding sources and those without such access. As companies that find themselves capital constrained and look for assistance, DDR anticipates that many new investment opportunities will become available. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements of the Company include accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries where the Company has financial or operating control. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized available information, including the Companys history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize. Application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may affect the comparability of the Companys results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis, which averages minimum rents over the current term of the leases. Certain of these leases provide for percentage and overage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the tenant. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved and reported to the Company. The leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance and other operating expenses and real estate taxes. Accordingly, revenues associated with tenant reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant lease provision. Management fees are recorded in the period earned. Ancillary and other property-related income, which includes the leasing of vacant space to temporary tenants, are recognized in the period earned. Lease termination fees are included in other income and recognized and earned upon termination of a tenants lease and relinquishment of space in which the Company has no further obligation to the tenant. Acquisition and financing fees are recognized at the completion of the respective transaction and earned in accordance with the underlying agreements. The Company makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rents, including straight-line rentals, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income. The Company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, the Company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable. In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year. These estimates have a direct impact on the Companys net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income. Real Estate Land, buildings and fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and/or replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 64 Table of Contents Properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings Useful lives, ranging from 30 to 40 years Furniture/Fixtures and Tenant Improvements Useful lives, which approximate two to 30 years, where applicable The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income. If the Company would lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset, it would be depreciated over more years and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income. Assessment of recoverability by the Company of certain other lease-related costs must be made when the Company has a reason to believe that the tenant may not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected. This requires management to make estimates as to the recoverability of such assets. Gains from sales of outlots, land parcels and shopping centers are generally recognized using the full accrual or partial sale method (as applicable) in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 66  Accounting for Real Estate Sales, provided that various criteria relating to the terms of sale and any subsequent involvement by the Company with the properties sold are met. Long-Lived Assets On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of real estate properties may be impaired. A propertys value is impaired only if managements estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property. In managements estimate of cash flows, it considers factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, the effects of demand, competition and other factors. In addition, the undiscounted cash flows may consider a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated. The determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates by management and considers the expected course of action at the balance sheet date. Subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists and whether the effects could have a material impact on the Companys net income. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs of such assets. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net book value of the assets, an impairment charge is recorded. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties and other investments. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income because taking an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The Company allocates the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a gross basis based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, the Company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence, marketing and leasing activities. It applies various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. Depending upon the size of the acquisition, the Company may engage an outside appraiser to perform a valuation of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company is required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations. 65 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has a number of off balance sheet joint ventures and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures. The Company consolidates certain entities in which it owns less than a 100% equity interest if it is deemed to have a controlling interest or is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity, as defined in Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)). To the extent that the Company contributes assets to a joint venture, the Companys investment in the joint venture is recorded at the Companys cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that the Companys cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in the Companys share of equity in net income of joint ventures. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures, the Company will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partners interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale. Discontinued Operations Pursuant to the definition of a component of an entity as described in SFAS No. 144, assuming no significant continuing involvement, the sale of a retail or industrial property is now considered a discontinued operation. In addition, the operations from properties classified as held for sale are considered a discontinued operation. The Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Accordingly, the results of operations of operating properties disposed of or classified as held for sale for which the Company has no significant continuing involvement, are reflected as discontinued operations. Interest expense, which is specifically identifiable to the property, is used in the computation of interest expense attributable to discontinued operations. Consolidated interest and debt at the corporate level is allocated to discontinued operations pursuant to the methods prescribed under Emerging Issue Task Force (EITF) 87-24, based on the proportion of net assets sold. Included in discontinued operations as of and for the three years ending December 31, 2005, are 63 properties aggregating 5.5 million square feet of gross leasable area. The operations of such properties have been reflected on a comparative basis as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for each of the three years ending December 31, 2005, included herein. 66 Table of Contents Stock-Based Employee Compensation The Company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize compensation cost for stock options when the option exercise price equals or exceeds the market value on the date of the grant. The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment (see New Accounting Standards), on January 1, 2006. Had compensation cost for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair values of the options and other equity awards granted at the grant dates, consistent with the method set forth in the SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net income, as reported $ 282,643 $ 269,762 $ 240,261 Add: Stock-based employee compensation included in reported net income 5,652 6,308 5,017 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards (5,319 ) (5,062 ) (5,200 ) $ 282,976 $ 271,008 $ 240,078 Earnings Per Share: Basic  as reported $ 2.10 $ 2.27 $ 2.31 Basic  pro forma $ 2.10 $ 2.28 $ 2.31 Diluted  as reported $ 2.08 $ 2.24 $ 2.27 Diluted  pro forma $ 2.09 $ 2.25 $ 2.27 Certain of the Companys executive officers were granted performance unit awards that provide for the issuance of up to 666,666 common shares. The amount of the total grant is determined based on the annualized total shareholders return over a five-year period with the common shares issued vesting over the remaining five-year period. As of December 31, 2004, the determination period for 200,000 of these shares was complete and the applicable threshold was satisfied. The Company has prepared quarterly estimates for the accrual of these shares based on the current stock price, dividend yield and the remaining vesting periods. The Companys stock price has a direct impact on the Companys recorded expense because a higher stock price will result in an increase in general and administrative expenses and decrease in net income. Accrued Liabilities The Company makes certain estimates for accrued liabilities including accrued professional fees, interest, real estate taxes, performance units (see discussion above), insurance and litigation reserves. These estimates are subjective and based on historical payments, executed agreements, anticipated trends and representations from service providers. These estimates are prepared based on information available at each balance sheet date and are reevaluated upon the receipt of any additional information. Many of these estimates are for payments that occur in one year. These estimates have a direct impact on the Companys net income because a higher accrual will result in less net income. 67 Table of Contents Comparison of 2005 to 2004 Results of Operations Continuing Operations Revenues from Operations (In thousands) 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Base and percentage rental revenues $ 522,505 $ 415,272 $ 107,233 25.8 % Recoveries from tenants 158,076 116,975 41,101 35.1 % Ancillary income 9,548 3,162 6,386 202.0 % Other property related income 4,888 4,147 741 17.9 % Management fee income 19,657 14,626 5,031 34.4 % Development fee income 3,202 2,311 891 38.6 % Other 9,300 13,081 (3,781 ) (28.9 )% Total revenues $ 727,176 $ 569,574 $ 157,602 27.7 % Base and percentage rental revenues relating to new leasing, re-tenanting and expansion of the Core Portfolio Properties (shopping center properties owned as of January 1, 2004, excluding properties under development and those classified as discontinued operations) increased approximately $4.9 million, which is an increase of 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004. The increase in base and percentage rental revenues is due to the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Core Portfolio Properties $ 4.9 Acquisition of real estate assets in 2005 and 2004 132.7 Development and redevelopment of 12 shopping center properties in 2005 and 2004 9.8 Transfer of 49 properties to unconsolidated joint ventures in 2005 and 2004 (44.6 ) Business center properties (2.6 ) Straight line rents 7.0 $ 107.2 At December 31, 2005, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys 469 shopping center portfolio was 95.3%, as compared to 94.7% at December 31, 2004. The average annualized base rent per occupied square foot was $11.01 at December 31, 2005, as compared to $10.79 at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys 269 wholly-owned shopping centers was 94.4%, as compared to 93.7% at December 31, 2004. The average annualized base rent per leased square foot was $10.42 at December 31, 2005, as compared to $9.70 at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys 200 joint venture shopping centers (including 37 consolidated centers) was 97.0% as compared to 97.1% at December 31, 2004. The average annualized base rent per leased square foot was $12.05 at December 31, 2005, as compared to $12.15 at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys business centers was 43.2%, as compared to 76.0% at December 31, 2004. The Company sold 25 of its business centers in September 2005. The remaining business centers consist of seven assets in five states. Recoveries were approximately 85.8% and 84.6% of operating expenses and real estate taxes for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to changes in the Companys portfolio of properties and an increase in occupancy. 68 Table of Contents The increase in recoveries from tenants was primarily related to the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Acquisition of properties in 2005 and 2004 $ 44.9 Transfer of properties to joint ventures in 2005 and 2004 (11.9 ) Development properties becoming operational and an increase in operating expenses at the remaining shopping center and business center properties 8.1 $ 41.1 Ancillary income increased due to income earned from acquisition of properties from the CPG and Benderson portfolios. The Company anticipates that this ancillary income will grow with additional opportunities in these portfolios. The Companys ancillary income program continues to be an industry leader among open-air companies. Continued growth is anticipated in the area of ancillary, or non-traditional revenue, as additional revenue opportunities are pursued and as currently established revenue opportunities proliferate throughout the Companys core, acquired and development portfolios. Ancillary revenue opportunities have in the past included short-term and seasonal leasing programs, outdoor advertising programs, wireless tower development programs and energy management programs. The increase in management fee income is primarily from unconsolidated joint venture interests formed in 2004 and 2005 and the continued growth of the MDT Joint Venture which aggregated $5.5 million. This increase was offset by the sale of several of the Companys joint venture properties, which contributed approximately $0.7 million management fee income in 2004. The remaining increase of $0.2 million is due to an increase in fee income at several of the Companys operating joint ventures. Management fee income is expected to continue to increase as the MDT Joint Venture and other joint ventures acquire additional properties. Development fee income was primarily earned through the redevelopment of five assets through the Coventry II Joint Venture. The Company expects to continue to pursue additional development joint ventures as opportunities present themselves. Other income is comprised of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Lease termination fees and bankruptcy settlements $ 5.9 $ 9.8 Acquisition and financing fees (1) 2.4 3.0 Other miscellaneous 1.0 0.3 $ 9.3 $ 13.1 (1) Financing fees received in connection with the MDT Joint Venture, excluding the Companys retained ownership of approximately 14.5%. The Companys fees are earned in conjunction with the timing and amount of the transaction by the joint venture.

Total general and administrative expenses were approximately 4.6% and 4.9%, respectively, of total revenues, including total revenues of joint ventures, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company continues to expense internal leasing salaries, legal salaries and related expenses associated with the leasing and re-leasing of existing space. In addition, the Company capitalized certain direct construction administration costs consisting of direct wages and benefits, travel expenses and office overhead costs of $6.2 million and $5.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Service Merchandise advance was $91.6 million at December 31, 2005. The Community Centers advance was repaid in July 2005. Interest expense increased primarily due to the acquisitions of assets combined with other development assets becoming operational and the increase in short-term interest rates. The weighted average debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2005, was $3.6 billion and 5.5%, respectively, compared to $2.8 billion and 5.0%, respectively, for the same period in 2004. At December 31, 2005, the Companys weighted average interest rate was 5.7% compared to 5.4% at December 31, 2004. Interest costs capitalized, in conjunction with development and expansion projects and development joint venture interests, were $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $9.9 million for the same period in 2004.

In addition in 2005, the Companys unconsolidated joint ventures recognized an aggregate gain from the sale of joint venture assets of $49.0 million, of which the Companys proportionate share was $13.0 million. In 2004, the Companys unconsolidated joint ventures recognized an aggregate gain from the sale of joint venture assets of approximately $44.4 million, of which the Companys proportionate share was $14.4 million. In addition, in 2004, the Company recognized promoted income of approximately $3.3 million relating to the sale of a shopping center transferred to the MDT Joint Venture in November 2003 upon elimination of contingencies and substantial completion and lease-up in 2004. The Companys joint ventures sold the following assets: 2005 Sales 2004 Sales Three 20% owned shopping centers One 20% owned shopping center One 24.75% owned shopping center One 35% owned shopping center Eight sites formerly occupied by Service Merchandise A portion of a 24.75% owned shopping center Ten sites formerly occupied by Service Merchandise These decreases above were partially offset by an increase in joint venture income from newly formed joint ventures in 2004 and 2005, including assets acquired by the Companys MDT Joint Venture. Minority equity interest expense increased primarily due to the following: Increase (Decrease) Issuance of common operating partnership units in conjunction with the acquisition of assets from Benderson in May 2004 $ 0.4 Formation of the Mervyns Joint Venture consolidated investment in September 2005, which is owned approximately 50% by the Company 1.6 Dividends on common operating partnership units and a net increase in net income from consolidated joint venture investments 1.0 Conversion of 0.2 million operating partnership units into an equal amount of common shares of the Company in 2004 (0.2 ) $ 2.8 Income tax expense of the Companys taxable REIT subsidiaries decreased due to a reduction in franchise taxes from assets disposed of in 2004 and the loss on sale of an asset in 2005. 71 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations (In thousands) 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Income from operations $ 1,800 $ 7,357 $ (5,557 ) (75.5 )% Gain on disposition of real estate, net 16,667 8,561 8,106 94.7 % $ 18,467 $ 15,918 $ 2,549 16.0 % Included in discontinued operations are the operations of 23 shopping center properties and 27 business center properties aggregating approximately 4.6 million square feet of GLA, of which 35 were sold in 2005 and 15 in 2004. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 related to the sale of a shopping center in 2005 and the sale of a business center in 2004. Gain on the disposition of discontinued operations is primarily due to the sale of 10 non-core properties and 25 business center properties in 2005.

The increase in base and percentage rental revenues is due to the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Core Portfolio Properties $ 3.4 Merger with JDN 19.4 Acquisition of 4 shopping center properties in 2004 and 2003 13.3 Acquisition of properties from Benderson 83.1 Development and redevelopment of 10 shopping center properties in 2004 and 2003 1.4 Consolidation of a joint venture interest (FIN 46) 2.9 Transfer of 30 properties to unconsolidated joint ventures in 2004 and 2003 (29.0 ) Business center properties 0.1 Straight line rents 1.2 $ 95.8 At December 31, 2004, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys shopping center portfolio was 94.7%, as compared to 94.3% at December 31, 2003. The average annualized base rent per occupied square foot was $10.79 at December 31, 2004, as compared to $10.82 at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys wholly-owned shopping centers was 93.7%, as compared to 92.9% at December 31, 2003. The average annualized base rent per leased square foot was $9.70 at December 31, 2004, as compared to $9.53 at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys joint venture shopping centers was 97.1%, as compared to 98.5% at December 31, 2003. The average annualized base rent per leased square foot was $12.15 at December 31, 2004, as compared to $13.74 at December 31, 2003. The decrease in the average annualized base rent per leased square foot is primarily attributable to the formation of two new joint ventures that acquired two grocery-anchored portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2004. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate occupancy of the Companys business centers was 76.0%, as compared to 78.1% at December 31, 2003. Recoveries were approximately 84.6% and 82.0% of operating expenses and real estate taxes for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The slight increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense (see Expenses from Operations  Rental Operating and Maintenance Expenses) and changes in the Companys portfolio of properties. The increase in recoveries from tenants was primarily related to the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Merger with JDN $ 6.3 Acquisition of 4 shopping center properties in 2004 and 2003 7.6 Acquisition of properties from Benderson 19.5 Transfer of 18 properties to joint ventures in 2004 and 2003 (7.8 ) Development properties becoming operational and an increase in operating expenses at the remaining shopping center and business center properties 3.6 $ 29.2 Other property related income increases were primarily due to operating income from Gameworks and Cinemark Theatres at The Pike, a shopping center development in Long Beach, California. 74 Table of Contents The increase in management fee income is from unconsolidated joint venture interests acquired and formed in 2003 and 2004, which aggregated $4.7 million. This increase was offset by the sale and transfer of several of the Companys joint venture properties, which contributed approximately $0.8 million management fee income in 2003. The remaining $0.1 million increase primarily relates to an increase in fee income from the remaining joint venture and managed property portfolio. Development fee income was primarily earned through one of the Companys joint ventures involved in the redevelopment of certain real estate assets, previously owned and controlled by Service Merchandise, and the redevelopment of four assets through the Coventry II Joint Venture. Other income is comprised of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Lease termination fees and bankruptcy settlements $ 9.8 $ 6.7 Settlement of call option (1)  2.4 Acquisition and financing fees (2) 3.0 3.5 Sale of option rights (3) and other miscellaneous 0.3 1.2 $ 13.1 $ 13.8 (1) Settlement of a call option in March 2003, relating to the MOPPRS debt assumed from JDN, principally arising from an increase in interest rates from the date of acquisition, March 13, 2003, to the date of settlement. (2) Structuring and financing fees received in connection with the MDT Joint Venture, excluding the Companys retained ownership of approximately 14.5%.

The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the growth of the Company through recent acquisitions, expansions and developments, including the JDN merger, acquisition of assets from Benderson and expenses related to the implementation of Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, certain non-cash incentive compensation costs, primarily performance units and deferred director compensation, increased due to the increase in the Companys share price, resulting in an additional $1.1 million of general and administrative costs. The Company expensed internal leasing salaries, legal salaries and related expenses associated with the leasing and re-leasing of existing space. In addition, the Company capitalized certain direct construction administration costs consisting of direct wages and benefits, travel expenses and office overhead costs of $5.7 million and $5.1 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Interest expense increased primarily due to the JDN merger and acquisition of assets from Benderson combined with other acquisitions and developments and the Companys focus on reducing its exposure to floating rate debt through the issuance of long-term unsecured debt. The weighted average debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2004, was $2.8 billion and 5.0%, respectively, compared to $2.0 billion and 5.0%, respectively, for the same period in 2003. At December 31, 2004, the Companys weighted average interest rate was 5.4% compared to 4.8% at December 31, 2003. Interest costs capitalized, in conjunction with development and expansion projects and development joint venture interests, were $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $11.5 million for the same period in 2003. 76 Table of Contents Other expense is comprised of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Abandoned acquisition and development projects $ 1.8 $ 0.9 Legal settlement  9.2 (1) $ 1.8 $ 10.1 (1) Relates to litigation filed against the Company by Regal Cinemas consisting of an $8.7 million judgment plus interest and legal costs.

In 2004, the Companys unconsolidated joint ventures recognized an aggregate gain from the sale of joint venture assets of approximately $44.4 million, of which the Companys proportionate share was $14.4 million. In addition, the Company recognized promoted income of approximately $3.3 million in 2004 relating to the sale of a shopping center transferred to the MDT Joint Venture in November 2003 upon elimination of contingencies and substantial completion and lease-up in 2004. In 2003, the Companys unconsolidated joint ventures recognized an aggregate gain from the sale of joint venture assets of approximately $63.6 million, of which the Companys proportionate share was $16.2 million. Additionally, the Company in 2003 received a promoted interest of approximately $7.5 million from these gains and recorded $3.4 million relating to a gain on extinguishment of debt at one joint venture. The Companys joint ventures sold the following assets: 2004 Sales 2003 Sales One 20% owned shopping center Three 20% owned shopping centers One 35% owned shopping center One 24.75% owned shopping center A portion of 24.75% owned shopping center One 50% owned shopping center Ten sites formerly occupied by Service Merchandise 22 sites formerly occupied by Service Merchandise A summary of the decrease in equity in net income of joint ventures is comprised of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Reduction in sale transactions as compared to 2003 $ (11.0 ) Joint ventures formed in 2003 and 2004 6.6 Debt refinancing and asset sales 2.9 Gain on extinguishment of debt (3.4 ) Consolidation of a joint venture interest (FIN 46) 0.6 Change in equity income of other joint venture interests, net 0.2 $ (4.1 ) 77 Table of Contents Gain on sale of joint venture interests related to the sale of joint venture interests to the MDT Joint Venture in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company retained a 14.5% effective ownership interest in these assets and accordingly deferred approximately $19.5 million of the gain, which will be amortized over the life of the assets. Minority equity interest expense decreased primarily due to the redemption of $180 million of preferred operating partnership interests from the proceeds associated with the issuance of the Preferred Class G shares in March 2003 and was offset slightly due to the issuance of common operating partnership units in conjunction with the acquisition of assets from Benderson. Income tax expense of the Companys taxable REIT subsidiaries and franchise taxes is primarily attributable to an increase in franchise taxes related, in large part, to acquisitions offset by a $0.6 million refund of 2000 taxes.

The Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million and $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the sale of one business center property and two shopping centers, respectively. Gain on the disposition of discontinued operations is primarily due to the sale of 15 properties in 2004.

(5) Primarily released to earnings upon the leasing of units associated with master lease obligations and other obligations. (6) May be recovered through an earnout arrangement with the buyer over the next several years. The cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard is attributable to the consolidation of the partnership that owns a shopping center in Martinsville, Virginia upon adoption of FIN 46. This amount represents the minority partners share of cumulative losses in the partnership that were eliminated upon consolidation. Net Income (In thousands) 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Net Income $ 269,762 $ 240,261 $ 29,501 12.3 % Net income increased primarily due to the acquisition of assets from Benderson, the JDN merger, gain on sale of assets and public debt and equity offerings. A summary of the changes from 2003 is as follows (in millions): Increase in net operating revenues (total revenues in excess of operating and maintenance expenses and real estate taxes) $ 102.2 Increase in general and administrative expenses (6.3 ) Decrease in other expenses 8.3 Increase in gain on disposition of real estate 10.7 Increase in income from discontinued operations 8.2 Decrease in minority interest expense 0.3 Decrease in equity in net income of joint ventures (4.1 ) Increase in interest expense (40.7 ) Decrease in gain on sale of joint venture interests (8.0 ) Decrease in interest income (0.8 ) Increase in depreciation expense (37.5 ) Decrease in income tax expense 0.2 Increase in cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard (FIN 46) (3.0 ) $ 29.5 FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS The Company believes that Funds From Operations (FFO), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess the financial performance of real estate investment trusts (REITs). It is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate investments, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions, and many companies utilize different depreciable lives and methods. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities and interest costs. This provides a perspective of the Companys financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 79 Table of Contents FFO is generally defined and calculated by the Company as net income, adjusted to exclude: (i) preferred dividends, (ii) gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable real estate property, except for those sold through the Companys merchant building program, which are presented net of taxes, (iii) sales of securities, (iv) extraordinary items, (v) cumulative effect of adoption of new accounting standards and (vi) certain non-cash items. These non-cash items principally include real property depreciation, equity income from joint ventures and equity income from minority equity investments and adding the Companys proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures and minority equity investments, determined on a consistent basis. For the reasons described above, management believes that FFO provides the Company and investors with an important indicator of the Companys operating performance. This measure of performance is used by the Company for several business purposes and by other REITs. It provides a recognized measure of performance other than GAAP net income, which may include non-cash items (often large). Other real estate companies may calculate FFO in a different manner. The Company uses FFO (i) in executive employment agreements to determine incentives based on the Companys performance, (ii) as a measure of a real estate assets performance, (iii) to shape acquisition, disposition and capital investment strategies and (iv) to compare the Companys performance to that of other publicly traded shopping center REITs. Management recognizes FFOs limitations when compared to GAAPs income from continuing operations. FFO does not represent amounts available for needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations, or other commitments and uncertainties. Management does not use FFO as an indicator of the Companys cash obligations and funding requirement for future commitments, acquisitions or development activities. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO is simply used as an additional indicator of the Companys operating performance. In 2005, FFO applicable to common shareholders was $355.1 million, as compared to $292.3 million in 2004 and $211.7 million in 2003. The increase in total FFO in 2005 is principally attributable to increases in revenues from the Core Portfolio Properties, the acquisition of assets, developments and the gain on sale of certain recently developed assets. The Companys calculation of FFO is as follows (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Net income applicable to common shareholders (1) $ 227,474 $ 219,056 $ 189,056 Depreciation and amortization of real estate investments 169,117 130,536 93,174 Equity in net income of joint ventures (34,873 ) (40,895 ) (44,967 ) Gain on sale of joint venture interests   (7,950 ) Joint ventures FFO (2) 49,302 46,209 47,942 Minority equity interests (OP Units) 2,916 2,607 1,769 Gain on disposition of depreciable real estate (3) (58,834 ) (68,179 ) (67,352 ) Cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard (4)  3,001  FFO applicable to common shareholders 355,102 292,335 211,672 Preferred dividends (5) 55,169 50,706 51,205 Total FFO $ 410,271 $ 343,041 $ 262,877 (1) Includes straight-line rental revenues, which approximated $14.4 million in 2005, $7.4 million in 2004 and $6.3 million in 2003 (including discontinued operations). 80 Table of Contents (2) Joint ventures FFO is summarized as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended 2005 2004 2003 Net income (a) $ 122,586 $ 118,779 $ 120,899 Depreciation and amortization of real estate investments 87,508 68,456 45,074 Gain on disposition of real estate, net (b) (19,014 ) (37,866 ) (59,354 ) $ 191,080 $ 149,369 $ 106,619 DDR Ownership interests (c) $ 49,302 $ 46,209 $ 47,942 (a) Includes straight-line rental revenue of approximately $6.6 million in 2005, $6.5 million in 2004 and $4.8 million in 2003. The Companys proportionate share of straight-line rental revenues was $1.1 million, $1.4 million and $1.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts include discontinued operations. (b) Included in equity in net income of joint ventures is approximately $7.5 million of promoted income received from the Companys joint venture partners during the fourth quarter of 2003 that is included in the Companys FFO. Also included in the joint venture net income and FFO, in 2003, is a gain associated with the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $4.2 million, of which the Companys proportionate share approximated $3.4 million. The gain on sale of recently developed shopping centers, owned by the Companys taxable REIT affiliates, is included in FFO, as the Company considers these properties as part of the merchant building program. These properties were either developed through the Retail Value Investment Program with Prudential Real Estate Investors, or were assets sold in conjunction with the formation of the joint venture that holds the designation rights for the Service Merchandise properties. These gains aggregated $30.8 million, $6.5 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of which the Companys proportionate share aggregated $7.6 million, $1.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively. (c) The Companys share of joint venture net income has been reduced by $2.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.6 million for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, related to basis differentials. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company owned joint venture interests relating to 110, 103 and 54 operating shopping center properties, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company owned, through its approximately 25% owned joint venture, 53, 63 and 72 shopping center sites, respectively, formerly owned by Service Merchandise. The Company also owned an approximate 25% interest in the assets owned through the Prudential Retail Value Investment Program and a 50% joint venture equity interest in a real estate management/development company. (3) The amount reflected as gain on disposition of real estate and real estate investments from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of operations includes residual land sales, which management considers a sale of non-depreciated real property, and the sale of newly developed shopping centers, for which the Company maintained continuing involvement. These sales are included in the Companys FFO and therefore are not reflected as an adjustment to FFO. In 2005, these gains include a portion of the net gain of approximately $6.6 million recognized from the sale of a shopping center located in Plainville, Connecticut through the Companys taxable REIT subsidiary, associated with its merchant building program. The remaining $14.3 million of the gain recognized on the sale of the shopping center located in Plainville, Connecticut was not included in the computation of FFO as the Company believes such amount was derived primarily from the acquisition of its partners approximate 75% interest in the shopping center following substantial completion of development. Additionally, the Companys gain on sales of real estate during 2005, was reduced by $1.9 million relating to debt prepayment costs incurred as a result of a sales transaction. This debt prepayment has been accounted for as a cost of sale, and neither the gross gain on sale nor the related costs of the sale have been included in FFO. (4) The Company recorded a charge of $3.0 million in 2004 as a cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard attributable to the consolidation of the shopping center in Martinsville, Virginia. This amount represents the minority partners share of cumulative losses in the partnership. (5) The Company complied with the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) July 31, 2003, Staff Policy Statement that clarifies EITF Topic No. D-42, The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock, and recorded the non-cash charges associated with the write-off of original issuance costs related to the Companys redemption of preferred shares. As a result of this change in accounting principle, the Company recorded a charge of $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to net income applicable to common shareholders and FFO. 81 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company anticipates that cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all interest and monthly principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, recurring tenant improvements and dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings available under its existing revolving credit facilities, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, including the issuance of common and preferred shares, OP Units, joint venture capital and asset sales, will provide the necessary capital to achieve continued growth. The proceeds from the sale of assets classified as discontinued operations and asset sales are utilized for newly acquired and developed assets. The increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of assets and various financing transactions. The Companys acquisition and developments completed in 2005 and 2004, new leasing, expansion and re-tenanting of the Core Portfolio Properties continue to add to the Companys cash flow. Changes in cash flow from investing activities in 2005, as compared to 2004 are primarily due to a decrease in real estate acquired with cash and proceeds from the contribution of properties to unconsolidated joint ventures offset by an increase in proceeds from the disposition of real estate as described in Strategic Real Estate Transactions. Changes in cash flow from financing activities in 2005, as compared to 2004, are primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from issuance of medium term notes, common and preferred shares and an increase in the repayment of debt as described in Financing Activities. The Companys cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 355,423 $ 292,226 $ 263,129 Cash flow used for investing activities (339,443 ) (1,134,601 ) (16,246 ) Cash flow (used for) provided by financing activities (35,196 ) 880,553 (251,561 ) The Company satisfied its REIT requirement of distributing at least 90% of ordinary taxable income with declared common and preferred share dividends of $290.1 million in 2005 as compared to $245.3 million and $186.1 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accordingly, federal income taxes were not incurred at the corporate level. The Companys common share dividend payout ratio for the year approximated 67.0% of its 2005 FFO as compared to 67.3% and 65.3% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In February 2006, the Company declared an increase in the 2006 quarterly dividend per common share to $0.59 from $0.54 in 2005. The Company anticipates that the increased dividend level will continue to result in a conservative payout ratio. The payout ratio is determined based on common and preferred dividends declared as compared to the Companys FFO. A low payout ratio enables the Company to retain more capital, which will be utilized towards attractive investment opportunities in the development, acquisition and expansion of portfolio properties or for debt repayment. The Company believes that it has one of the lowest payout ratios in the industry. See Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments sections for discussion of additional disclosure of capital resources. 82 Table of Contents ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPANSIONS During the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, the Company and its consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures expended approximately $6.0 billion, net of proceeds, to acquire, develop, expand, improve and re-tenant its properties as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Company: Acquisitions $ 1,610.8 (1) $ 2,170.8 (7) $ 1,363.6 (11) Completed expansions 41.6 25.2 26.8 Developments and construction in progress 246.1 203.8 104.6 Tenant improvements and building renovations (2) 7.5 6.6 6.3 Furniture and fixtures and equipment 10.7 (3) 1.3 1.9 1,916.7 2,407.7 1,503.2 Less real estate sales and property contributed to joint ventures (490.8 ) (4) (689.2 ) (8) (422.4 ) (12) Company total 1,425.9 1,718.5 1,080.8 Joint Ventures: Acquisitions/ contributions 350.0 (5) 1,147.0 (9) 1,221.7 (13) Completed expansions 9.3 10.3 9.7 Developments and construction in progress 87.5 38.9 120.1 Tenant improvements and building renovations (2) 6.8 0.6 0.6 453.6 1,196.8 1,352.1 Less real estate sales (148.8 ) (6) (306.7 ) (10) (781.5 ) (14) Joint ventures total 304.8 890.1 570.6 1,730.7 2,608.6 1,651.4 Less proportionate joint venture share owned by others (285.0 ) (807.8 ) (542.7 ) Total DDR net additions $ 1,445.7 $ 1,800.8 $ 1,108.7 (1) Includes the transfer to DDR from joint ventures of a shopping center in Dublin, Ohio.

The financing for the transaction was provided by the assumption of approximately $660 million of existing debt and line of credit borrowings of approximately $449.5 million on the Companys $1.0 billion senior unsecured credit facility and the application of a $30 million deposit funded in 2004. Mervyns Joint Venture In 2005, the Company formed the Mervyns Joint Venture, a consolidated joint venture, with MDT, which acquired the underlying real estate of 36 operating Mervyns stores for approximately $396.2 million. The Mervyns Joint Venture, owned 50% by the Company and 50% by MDT, obtained approximately $258.5 million of debt, of which $212.6 million is five-year secured non-recourse financing at a fixed rate of approximately 5.2%, and $45.9 million is variable rate financing at LIBOR plus 72 basis points for two years. The Mervyns Joint Venture purchased one additional site in 2006 for approximately $11.0 million. The Company is responsible for the day-to-day management of the assets and receives fees for property management in accordance with the same fee schedule as the Companys MDT Joint Venture. The Company funded its portion of the equity in the Mervyns Joint Venture through the Companys $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company received approximately $2.5 million of acquisition and financing fees in connection with the acquisition of the Mervyns assets. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), the Company is required to consolidate the Mervyns Joint Venture and, therefore, the $2.5 million of fees has been eliminated in consolidation and has been reflected as an adjustment in basis and is not reflected in net income. The Company also purchased an additional Mervyns site at one of the Companys wholly-owned shopping centers in Salt Lake City, Utah, for $14.4 million. 84 Table of Contents MDT Joint Venture In November 2003, the Company closed a transaction pursuant to which the Company formed an Australian-based Listed Property Trust, Macquarie DDR Trust (MDT), with Macquarie Bank Limited (ASX: MBL), an international investment bank, advisor and manager of specialized real estate funds in Australia (MDT Joint Venture). MDT focuses on acquiring ownership interests in institutional-quality community center properties in the United States. DDR has been engaged to provide day-to-day operations of the properties and receives fees at prevailing rates for property management, leasing, construction management, acquisitions, due diligence, dispositions (including outparcel sales) and financing. Through this joint venture, DDR and MBL will also receive base asset management fees and incentive fees based on the performance of MDT. At December 31, 2005, MDT, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in November 2003, owned an approximate 83% interest in the portfolio. DDR retained an effective 14.5% ownership interest in the assets with MBL primarily owning the remaining 2.5%. At December 31, 2005, the MDT Joint Venture owned 48 operating shopping center properties. The MDT Joint Venture purchased 12 properties from DDR in 2005 with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $348.0 million.

Sale of Office and Industrial Assets On September 30, 2005, the Company sold 25 office and industrial buildings acquired through the AIP merger aggregating approximately 3.2 million square feet for approximately $177.0 million, which includes a contingent purchase price of approximately $7.0 million in subordinated equity, based on the portfolios subsequent performance, including proceeds from a potential disposition. The Company recorded a gain of approximately $5.3 million, which does not include any contingent purchase price. The Company has included the historical operations and sale of these real estate assets as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations as the contingent consideration that may be received from the subordinated equity is not a direct cash flow of the properties pursuant to the terms of the transaction. Coventry II In 2003, the Coventry II Fund was formed with several institutional investors and Coventry Real Estate Advisors (CREA) as the investment manager (Coventry II Joint Venture). Neither the Company nor any of its officers own a common equity interest in the Coventry II Fund or have any incentive compensation tied to this Fund. The Coventry II Fund and DDR have agreed to jointly acquire value-added retail properties in the United States. CREA obtained $330 million of equity commitments to co-invest exclusively in joint ventures with DDR. The Coventry II Funds strategy is to invest in a variety of retail properties that present opportunities for value creation, such as re-tenanting, market repositioning, redevelopment or expansion. 85 Table of Contents DDR expects, but is not obligated, to co-invest 20% in each joint venture and will be responsible for day-to-day management of the properties. Pursuant to the terms of the joint venture, DDR will earn fees for property management, leasing and construction management.

Service Merchandise Joint Venture In March 2002, the Company entered into a joint venture with Lubert-Adler Funds and Klaff Realty, L.P., which was awarded asset designation rights for all of the retail real estate interests of the bankrupt estate of Service Merchandise Corporation. The Company has an approximate 25% interest in the joint venture. In addition, the Company earns fees for the management, leasing, development and disposition of the real estate portfolio. The designation rights enabled the joint venture to determine the ultimate use and disposition of the real estate interests held by the bankrupt estate. At December 31, 2005, the portfolio consisted of 53 Service Merchandise retail sites totaling approximately 2.9 million square feet, of which 77.3% is leased. During 2005, the joint venture sold eight sites and received gross proceeds of approximately $19.4 million and recorded an aggregate gain of $7.6 million, of which the Companys proportionate share was approximately $1.9 million.
