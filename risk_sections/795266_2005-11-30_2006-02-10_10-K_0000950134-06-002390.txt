BUSINESS General KB Home is one of Americas premier homebuilders. Kaufman & Broad S.A. (KBSA), our publicly-traded French subsidiary, is one of the leading homebuilders in France. Founded in 1957, and winner of the 2004 American Business Award for Best Overall Company, KB Home is a Fortune 500 company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KBH. KBSA, which builds commercial projects in addition to single-family homes and high density residential properties in France, is publicly traded on the Premier Marché of the Paris Bourse under the ticker symbol KOF. In 2005, we delivered 37,140 homes in 541 communities and generated total revenues of $9.44 billion and pretax income of $1.30 billion, up 34% and 81%, respectively, from 2004. We have two financial reporting segments, construction and financial services. In 2005, our construction segment accounted for 99% of both total revenues and pretax income. Our construction segment consists primarily of homebuilding operations in the United States and France. We use the terms home and unit to refer to a single-family residence, whether it is an attached single-family home, town home or condominium. By community we mean a single development in which homes are constructed as part of an integrated plan. We offer a variety of homes that are designed to appeal to a wide range of buyers, including first-time and move-up homebuyers as well as luxury and active adult buyers. The average selling price of our homes in 2005 was $252,100, up 15% from 2004. Domestically, we have a geographically diverse homebuilding business which, as of November 30, 2005, operated in the following four regions comprised of 14 states serving 39 major markets: Region State Markets West Coast California Bakersfield, Fresno, Los Angeles, Oakland, Riverside, Sacramento, San Diego and Stockton Southwest Arizona Phoenix and Tucson Nevada Las Vegas and Reno New Mexico Albuquerque Central Colorado Denver and Colorado Springs Illinois Chicago Indiana Indianapolis Texas Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, McAllen and San Antonio Southeast Florida Daytona Beach, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Lakeland, Melbourne, Orlando, Port St. Lucie, Sarasota and Tampa Georgia Atlanta Maryland Baltimore and Washington, D.C. North Carolina Charlotte and Raleigh South Carolina Charleston, Columbia and Greenville Virginia Washington, D.C. Our financial services segment provides mortgage banking services to our domestic homebuyers through Countrywide KB Home Loans, a joint venture with Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) established on September 1, 2005. Prior to September 1, 2005, we offered mortgage banking services directly through KB Home Mortgage Company (KBHMC), our wholly-owned financial services subsidiary. We are a Delaware corporation with principal executive offices at 10990 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90024. The telephone number of our corporate headquarters is (310) 231-4000 and our website address is http://www.kbhome.com. Our Spanish-language website is http://www.kbcasa.com. In addition, location and community information is available at (888) KB-HOMES. The website of KBSA is http://www.ketb.com. 1 Markets The following table sets forth unit deliveries, average selling prices and total construction revenues for the years ended November 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (excluding the effects of unconsolidated joint ventures) for each of our regions: Years Ended November 30, 2005 2004 2003 West Coast: Unit deliveries 6,624 5,383 5,549 Percent of total unit deliveries 18 % 17 % 20 % Average selling price $ 460,500 $ 411,500 $ 353,900 Total construction revenues (in millions)(1) $ 3,050.5 $ 2,215.2 $ 1,971.5 Southwest: Unit deliveries 7,357 7,478 6,695 Percent of total unit deliveries 20 % 23 % 25 % Average selling price $ 265,600 $ 202,600 $ 178,100 Total construction revenues (in millions)(1) $ 1,964.5 $ 1,518.0 $ 1,195.7 Central: Unit deliveries 9,866 9,101 7,659 Percent of total unit deliveries 27 % 29 % 28 % Average selling price $ 157,600 $ 151,300 $ 149,400 Total construction revenues (in millions)(1) $ 1,559.0 $ 1,385.9 $ 1,155.3 Southeast: Unit deliveries 7,162 4,975 3,504 Percent of total unit deliveries 19 % 16 % 13 % Average selling price $ 215,100 $ 171,700 $ 156,200 Total construction revenues (in millions)(1) $ 1,549.3 $ 855.4 $ 548.0 France: Unit deliveries 6,131 4,709 3,924 Percent of total unit deliveries 16 % 15 % 14 % Average selling price(2) $ 206,300 $ 211,500 $ 202,600 Total construction revenues (in millions)(1)(2) $ 1,287.0 $ 1,033.8 $ 904.9 Total: Unit deliveries 37,140 31,646 27,331 Average selling price(2) $ 252,100 $ 219,900 $ 206,500 Total construction revenues (in millions)(1)(2) $ 9,410.3 $ 7,008.3 $ 5,775.4 (1) Total construction revenues include revenues from residential development, commercial activities and land sales. (2) Average selling prices and total construction revenues for our French operations have been translated into U.S. dollars using weighted average exchange rates for each period. Our homebuilding operations have become geographically more diverse in recent years as a result of organic growth in our existing markets, our entry into new markets (de novo entry) and our acquisitions of regional homebuilders. In the early 1990s, we built virtually all of our homes in the California and Paris, France markets. Today, our U.S. operations span the country from coast to coast and KBSA has significantly expanded its operations in France. We believe this increased geographic diversity reduces the risk that a drop in demand in individual markets will adversely affect our overall financial results or financial condition. We also believe our geographic expansion in recent years has been a key driver of our growth. Since 2000, our unit deliveries have grown at a compound annual rate of 11%, and our total revenues and earnings per diluted share have increased at compound annual rates of 19% and 29%, respectively. To enhance our operating capabilities in regional submarkets, we conducted our domestic homebuilding business in 2005 through seven divisions in California, six divisions in Florida, five divisions in Texas, two divisions in each of Arizona and North Carolina, and one division in each of Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina and the Washington D.C. area. In addition, we operated 27 KB Home Studios in 2005, which are large 2 showrooms where our customers may select from thousands of options to conveniently purchase as part of the original construction of their homes. In France, KBSA operates our construction business through two residential divisional offices, one commercial property office and three home studios. West Coast. Our West Coast region, comprised of divisions in Northern and Southern California, accounted for 18% of our total unit deliveries in 2005 compared to 17% in 2004 and 20% in 2003. We delivered 6,624 homes in our West Coast region in 2005, an increase of 23% from the 5,383 units delivered in 2004. During 2005, we operated an average of 71 communities in our West Coast region compared with 60 in 2004. In Southern California, we conduct our homebuilding activities in the markets of Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. In Northern California, our homebuilding activities are conducted in the markets of Fresno, Oakland, Sacramento and Stockton. The communities we develop in our West Coast region generally consist of single-family homes designed for the entry-level, move-up, luxury and active adult markets. These homes ranged in size from approximately 1,200 to 3,700 square feet in 2005 and sold at an average price of $460,500. The average selling price in our West Coast region increased 12% in 2005 from the previous year average of $411,500 primarily due to favorable market conditions supporting higher prices, as well as increases in lot premiums and options sold through our KB Home Studios. Southwest. Our Southwest region, which includes operations in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, accounted for 20% of our unit deliveries in 2005 compared to 23% in 2004 and 25% in 2003. Deliveries from our Southwest region totaled 7,357 units in 2005, essentially flat with the prior year. During 2005, we operated an average of 85 communities in the region compared with 93 in 2004. We conduct our Southwest region homebuilding activities in the markets of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The communities we develop in our Southwest region consist of single-family homes designed for the entry-level, move-up, luxury and active adult markets. These homes ranged in size from approximately 1,300 to 3,600 square feet in 2005 and sold at an average price of $265,600. The average selling price in our Southwest region increased 31% in 2005 from $202,600 in 2004 as a result of favorable conditions in certain markets and communities, as well as increases in lot premiums and options sold through our KB Home Studios. Central. Our Central region, which includes operations in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana and Texas, accounted for 27% of our unit deliveries in 2005 compared to 29% in 2004 and 28% in 2003. Since delivering our first homes in the Central region in 1994, we have substantially grown these operations, both organically and through acquisitions. Our operations in the Central region delivered 9,866 units in 2005, up 8% from 9,101 units in 2004. We operated an average of 168 communities in the region in 2005 compared with 157 in 2004. In 2005, we conducted our Central region homebuilding activities in Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, McAllen and San Antonio, Texas. The communities we develop in our Central region consist primarily of single-family detached homes designed for the entry-level, move-up and luxury markets. These homes ranged in size from approximately 900 to 4,100 square feet in 2005 and sold at an average price of $157,600, up 4% from $151,300 in 2004 due to favorable conditions in certain markets and communities. Southeast. Our Southeast region, which includes operations in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, accounted for 19% of our home deliveries in 2005, up from 16% in 2004 and 13% in 2003. Our operations in the Southeast region delivered 7,162 units in 2005, up 44% from 4,975 units in 2004, primarily due to our expansion as a result of acquisitions completed in 2004 and 2003. Our operations in Florida have grown significantly since 2003, with unit deliveries more than doubling in the past two years. In 2005, we conducted our Southeast region homebuilding activities in Daytona Beach, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Lakeland, Melbourne, Orlando, Port St. Lucie, Sarasota and Tampa, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Charleston, Columbia and Greenville, South Carolina; and the Washington, D.C. area. 3 The communities we develop in our Southeast region consist primarily of single-family detached and low density attached homes targeted at the entry-level, move-up and luxury markets. These homes ranged in size from approximately 1,100 to 3,500 square feet in 2005 and sold at an average price of $215,100, up 25% from $171,700 in 2004, primarily due to a change in product mix. During 2005, we operated an average of 110 communities in the region compared with 77 in 2004. France. In France, we build single-family detached homes and condominiums principally for move-up buyers. In 2005, our residential construction in France consisted of 76% condominiums and 21% single-family homes. Our principal market in France is the Ile-de-France region, where we built 63% of our individual homes and 25% of our condominium units in 2005. Our operations in the Ile-de-France region comprise 29% of our unit delivery volume and 42% of our revenues in France. We also have well-developed homebuilding operations in other regions, principally in the main cities such as Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Strasbourg and Toulouse as well as in the Aquitaine, Cote dAzur, Languedoc-Roussillon, Midi-Pyrénées, Normandy and Rhone Alpes regions. In 2005, housing deliveries from our French homebuilding operations increased 30% from the prior year to 6,131 units. In France, we operated an average of 108 communities in 2005 compared with 97 in 2004. Deliveries from our French operations accounted for 16% of our home deliveries in 2005, up slightly when compared to 2004 and 2003. The single-family homes built by our French business ranged in size from approximately 650 to 2,500 square feet in 2005. The average selling price of our homes in France decreased 3% to $206,300 in 2005 from $211,500 in 2004 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency rates and a change in product mix. Our French subsidiary also conducts a commercial business which includes the development of commercial office buildings in Paris for sale to institutional investors. Revenues from commercial activities, all located in metropolitan Paris, totaled $5.2 million in 2005, $22.8 million in 2004 and $107.0 million in 2003. Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. From time to time, we participate in the acquisition, development, construction and sale of residential properties and commercial projects through unconsolidated joint ventures. These included joint ventures in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia and France in 2005. Unit deliveries from joint ventures comprised less than 2% of our total unit deliveries for 2005. Recent Developments. In 2005, we established a Mid-Atlantic division within our Southeast region, covering Maryland and Virginia, to expand de novo into the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore housing markets. We expect to begin delivering homes in the Washington, D.C. area in the latter half of 2006. In 2005, we also expanded our homebuilding operations in the Bakersfield and Fresno, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Reno, Nevada housing markets. Subsequent to the end of our 2005 fiscal year, in response to the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we announced our intention to construct homes in Louisiana through a joint venture with The Shaw Group, Inc. We established our KB Urban division in 2005 to further expand our product offerings to include high density and mixed use products, such as condominium complexes and residential/commercial projects, through which we plan to offer the style and comfort of our traditional home products in urban areas of major metropolitan areas. KB Urbans product offerings are designed to appeal to young and single professionals who wish to live closer to work, transportation and retail centers, as well as to retirees and others who desire to move to urban locations from the suburbs. Consistent with our strategy to expand our business into urban areas, we announced in January 2006 that our KB Urban division intends to participate in a partnership to build a hotel and condominium project in downtown Los Angeles. The project is expected to include 250 luxury condominiums and two separate hotels with a total of 1,100 rooms adjacent to the Los Angeles Convention Center. Strategy We began operating under the principles of our KBnxt operational business model in 1997. The KBnxt operational business model seeks to generate greater operating efficiencies and return on investment through a disciplined, fact-based 4 and process-driven approach to homebuilding that is founded on a constant and systematic assessment of consumer preferences and market opportunities. The key elements of our KBnxt operational business model include:  Gaining a detailed understanding of consumer location and product preferences through regular surveys;  In general, managing our working capital and reducing our operating risks by acquiring developed and entitled land at reasonable prices in markets with high growth potential;  Using our knowledge of consumer preferences to design, construct and deliver the products they desire;  In general, commencing construction of a home only after a purchase contract has been signed and the customers application for financing has been approved;  Building a backlog of sales orders and reducing the time from construction to final delivery of homes to customers;  Establishing an even flow of production of high quality homes at the lowest possible cost; and  Offering customers low base prices and the opportunity to customize their homes though choice of location, floor plans and interior design options. To generate continued growth through the execution of our KBnxt operational business model, we have concentrated on achieving a leading position in our existing markets, expanding our business into attractive new markets through de novo entry or acquisitions, and expanding our product lines in both our existing and new markets. We believe that this focus has allowed us to achieve lower costs and improved profitability through economies of scale with respect to land acquisitions, purchasing building materials, subcontracting labor and providing options to customers. Consistent with our current growth strategy, in 2005 we pursued organic growth in our existing markets and expansion into new markets, such as Washington, D.C. and downtown Los Angeles, through de novo entry. We also expanded our product line to include high density and mixed use products, such as condominium complexes and commercial/residential projects, supplementing our existing entry-level, move-up, luxury and active adult products. Generally, we expect to follow a similar approach in 2006. Organic growth in existing markets will be driven primarily by increasing the average number of communities we operate. De novo expansion will depend on our assessment of a potential new markets viability and our ability to develop operations in any new market we decide to enter. The extension of our product line into new product types and with respect to the products we make available in specific markets will be driven by our assessment of consumer preferences and fit within our existing business operations. We also will continue to explore appropriate acquisition opportunities to supplement organic and de novo growth in our business. In 2005, we continued our efforts to build a national brand that stands out from others in our industry. To advance this strategy, we entered into a licensing and co-marketing agreement with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia under which we plan to launch KB Homes Twin Lakes: New Homes Created with Martha Stewart in March 2006. Located near Raleigh, North Carolina, Twin Lakes will offer customers the opportunity to purchase homes inspired by several of Martha Stewarts personal residences that embody her unique aesthetic and classic approach to design. In 2006, we hope to expand this collaboration to our communities in other areas of the country. Our marketing efforts emphasize the quality and choice we provide to customers and our focus on customer service. We believe that our in-house team of architects creates distinctive designs that meet current customer demand. In addition, our KB Home Studios, stand-alone retail showrooms located near our communities, provide thousands of interior design and product options to customers that allow them to customize their homes to suit their tastes. To assure our homes are of high quality, in 2005 we continued to implement the National Association of Homebuilders National Housing Quality certification process, which requires a rigorous third party audit of construction practices and quality assurance systems demonstrating a planned, systematic and documented approach to quality. To date, eighteen of our operating divisions have been certified and our other divisions are working to achieve certification. We believe our results in the J.D. Power and Associates 2005 New Home Builder Customer Satisfaction Studysm reflect our commitment to customer satisfaction. In 2005, we ranked among the highest three positions in four major U.S. markets and showed overall improvements in seven markets. Our goal is to rank in the top three in every one of our markets across the United States. 5 In France, we introduced the American concept of a master bedroom suite, as well as walk-in closets, built-in kitchen cabinetry and two-car garages. We believe that our value engineering allows us to offer appealing and well-designed homes at competitive prices. Our French operations offer a broad choice of options to customers through new home studios in Paris, Lyon and Marseille that are similar to our U.S.-based KB Home Studios. To ensure consistency of our message and adherence to our KBnxt operational business model, the sales of our homes are carried out by an in-house team of sales representatives. Our sales representatives are trained to provide prospective customers with floor plan and design choices, pricing information and tours of fully furnished and landscaped model homes that are decorated to emphasize the distinctive options we can provide to customers. We also have representatives available in many of our U.S. communities to assist prospective customers with financing questions and to provide information on the homebuying process. The Internet continues to have a profound impact on the way people shop for homes today. Our consumer website, http://www.kbhome.com, includes features and tools to benefit visitors, including a Spanish-language version of the entire site, a video tour of the KB Home Studio to convey all the choices and products available in our retail design environment, a calculator that demonstrates to first-time buyers the financial impact of owning a home with a savings estimate versus their current rent, streaming video testimonials from actual KB homeowners and an online customer care area to support our homeowners. We continue to expand our online efforts and anticipate adding new features to the website in 2006. Local Expertise We believe that our business requires in-depth knowledge of local markets in order to acquire land in desirable locations and on favorable terms, to engage subcontractors, to plan communities keyed to local demand, to anticipate customer tastes in specific markets and to assess the regulatory environment. Accordingly, our divisional structure is designed to utilize local market expertise. We have experienced management teams in each of our divisions. Although we have centralized certain functions, such as marketing, advertising, legal, materials purchasing, product development, architecture and accounting, to benefit from economies of scale, our local management continues to exercise considerable autonomy in identifying land acquisition opportunities, developing product and sales strategies, conducting production operations and controlling costs. We seek to operate at optimal volume levels in each of our markets in order to maximize our competitive advantages and the benefits of the KBnxt operational business model. Community Development Our new home community development process generally consists of three phases: land acquisition, land development and home construction and sale. Historically, our community development process has ranged from six to 24 months in our West Coast region to a somewhat shorter duration in our other domestic regions. In France, the community development process has historically ranged from 12 to 30 months. The length of the community development process varies based on, among other things, the extent of government approvals required, the overall size of the community, necessary site preparation activities, weather conditions and marketing results. Although they vary significantly, our domestic new home communities typically consist of 50 to 250 lots ranging in size from 2,000 to 20,000 square feet on which we build homes for our customers. Depending on the community, we offer from two to five model home design options to customers, with premium lots often containing more square footage, better views or orientation benefits. In France, our single-family home developments typically consist of 50 to 150 lots, with average lot sizes of 5,500 square feet. Our goal is to own or control enough lots to meet our forecasted production goals in the United States and France over the next three years. Land Acquisition and Development. Prior to our adoption of our KBnxt operational business model in 1997, we typically acquired undeveloped and/ or unentitled land on which significantly more than 250 lots could be developed. Since we adopted our KBnxt operational business model, we have focused on obtaining land containing less than 250 lots and have substantially reduced our acquisition of undeveloped and/ or unentitled land. Instead, we have focused on acquiring lots which are entitled and physically developed (referred to as finished lots) or partially finished but entitled lots. Acquiring finished or partially finished lots enables us to construct and deliver homes shortly after the land is acquired with little additional development expenditures. This is a more efficient way to use our working capital and reduces the operating risks associated with having to develop and/ or entitle land, such as unforeseen improvement costs 6 and/ or changes in market conditions. However, depending on market conditions, we may from time to time acquire undeveloped and/or unentitled land, and we expect that the overall balance of undeveloped, unentitled, entitled and finished lots in our inventory will vary over time. Consistent with our KBnxt operational business model, we target geographic areas for potential land acquisitions based on the results of periodic surveys of both new and resale homebuyers in particular markets. Local, in-house land acquisition specialists conduct site selection research and analysis in targeted geographic areas to identify desirable land consistent with our marketing strategy. Studies performed by third-party marketing specialists are also utilized. Some of the factors we consider in evaluating land acquisition targets are consumer preferences; general economic conditions; specific market conditions, with an emphasis on the prices of comparable new and resale homes in the market; expected sales rates; proximity to metropolitan areas and employment centers; population and commercial growth patterns; estimated costs of completing lot development; and environmental matters. Extensive due diligence is also performed for each land acquisition with the results reported as part of the presentation to senior management prior to acquisition decisions. We generally structure our land purchases and development activities to minimize, or to defer the timing of, cash and capital expenditures, which enhances returns associated with new land investments. While we use a variety of techniques to accomplish this, as further described below, we typically use agreements that give us an option right to purchase land at a future date at a fixed price for a small or no initial deposit payment. Our decision to exercise a particular option right is based on the results of the due diligence we conduct after entering into an agreement. In some cases our decision to exercise an option may be conditioned on the land sellers obtaining necessary entitlements, such as zoning rights and environmental approvals, and/ or physically developing the land by a pre-determined date to allow us to build homes relatively quickly. Depending on the circumstances, our initial deposit payment for an option right may or may not be fully or substantially refundable to us if we do not actually purchase the underlying land. In addition to option agreements, we may acquire land under agreements that condition our purchase obligation on our satisfaction by a certain future date with the feasibility of developing and selling homes on the land. Our option and other purchase agreements may also allow us to phase our land purchase and/ or lot development obligations over a period of time and/ or subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We may also acquire land with seller financing that is non-recourse to us, or by working in conjunction with third-party land developers. As previously noted, under our KBnxt operational business model, we generally attempt to minimize our land development costs by focusing on acquiring finished or partially finished lots. Where we purchase unentitled and unimproved land, we typically use option agreements as described above and perform during an applicable option period technical, environmental, engineering and entitlement feasibility studies, while we seek to obtain necessary governmental approvals and permits. These activities are sometimes done with a sellers assistance or at the sellers cost. The use of option arrangements in this context allows us to conduct these development-related activities while minimizing our overall financial commitments, including interest and other carrying costs, and land inventories. It also improves our ability to accurately estimate development costs, an important element in planning communities and pricing homes, prior to incurring them. Before we commit to any land purchase, our senior corporate management carefully evaluates each acquisition opportunity based on the results of our local specialists due diligence and a set of strict financial measures, including, but not limited to, gross margin analyses and specific discounted after tax cash flow internal rate of return requirements. Prior to 2006, a single Land Committee, comprised of several of our highest-ranking executives, reviewed and approved or disapproved all domestic land acquisitions. In 2006, we have implemented a revised land acquisition review and approval process. Potential transactions involving significant financial commitments or that are outside the ordinary course of our business are subject to review and approval by our investment committee, which is composed of our senior executive officers. Smaller, but still sizeable potential transactions are subject to review and approval by our corporate land committee, which is composed of senior management experienced in land acquisitions. The smallest potential transactions for the release of non-refundable deposits and the expenditure of entitlement costs are subject to review and approval by our divisional land committees, which are composed of senior divisional and regional management, with further development expenditures subject to prior ratification by our corporate land committee. The stringent criteria guiding our land acquisition decisions has resulted in our geographic expansion to areas which generally offer better returns for lower 7 risk and lower cash and capital investment. In France, we also employ similar strategies and policies regarding land acquisition and development. The following table shows the number of lots we owned in various stages of development and under option contracts in our principal markets as of November 30, 2005 and 2004. The table does not include approximately 479 acres and 1,818 acres optioned in the United States in 2005 and 2004, respectively, which have not yet been approved for subdivision into lots.

As of November 30, 2005, 22% of the lots we owned or controlled were located in the West Coast region, 17% were in the Southwest region, 24% were in the Central region, 32% were in the Southeast region and 5% were in France. Home Construction and Sale. Following the purchase of land and, if necessary, the completion of the entitlement process, we typically begin marketing homes and constructing model homes. The time required for construction of our homes depends on the weather, time of year, local labor supply, availability of materials and supplies and other factors. The construction of our homes is generally contingent upon customer orders to minimize the costs and risks of standing inventory. As a result of our implementing the KBnxt operational business model, the percentage of sold inventory in production in our domestic operations has increased dramatically and was 88% as of November 30, 2005. At year-end 1996, prior to the implementation of our KBnxt operational business model, the percentage of sold inventory in production was 44%. We act as the general contractor for the majority of our communities and hire subcontractors for all production activities. The use of subcontractors enables us to reduce our investment in direct labor costs, equipment and facilities. Where practical, we use mass production techniques, and prepackaged, standardized components and materials to streamline the on-site production phase. We have also developed systems for national and regional purchasing of certain building materials, appliances and other items to take advantage of economies of scale and to reduce costs through improved pricing and, where available, participation in national manufacturers rebate programs. At all stages of production, our own administrative and on-site supervisory personnel coordinate the activities of subcontractors and subject their work to quality and cost controls. As part of our KBnxt operational business model, we have also emphasized even flow production methods to enhance the quality of our homes, minimize production costs and improve the predictability of our revenues and earnings. We generally price our homes in a given community only after we have entered into contracts for the construction of such homes with subcontractors for that community, an approach that improves our ability to estimate gross profits accurately. Wherever possible, we seek to acquire land and construct homes at costs that allow selling prices to be set at levels at or below those of immediate competitors on a per square foot basis, while maintaining appropriate gross margins. Our division personnel provide assistance to homebuyers during all phases of the homebuying process and after the home is sold. The coordinated efforts of sales representatives, KB Home Studio consultants, on-site construction superintendents and post-closing customer service personnel in the customers homebuying experience is intended to provide high levels of customer satisfaction and lead to enhanced customer retention and referrals. In our domestic homebuilding operations, we provide customers with a limited home warranty program administered by personnel in each of our divisions. This arrangement is designed to give our customers prompt and efficient post-delivery service. For homes sold in the United States, we generally provide a structural warranty of 10 years, a warranty on electrical, heating, 8 cooling, plumbing and other building systems each varying from two to five years based on geographic market and state law, and a warranty of one year for other components of the home such as appliances. Backlog Sales of our homes are made pursuant to standard sales contracts, which generally require a customer deposit at the time of execution and an additional payment upon mortgage approval. We generally permit customers to cancel their obligations and obtain refunds of all or a portion of their deposits in the event mortgage financing cannot be obtained within a period of time, as specified in the contract. Backlog consists of homes which are under contract but have not yet been delivered. Ending backlog represents the number of units in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net orders (sales made less cancellations) taken during the current period minus unit deliveries made during the current period. The backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations. In addition, deliveries of new homes typically increase from the first to the fourth quarter in any year. Our backlog at November 30, 2005, excluding the effects of unconsolidated joint ventures, reached 25,722 units, up 27% from the 20,280 backlog units at year-end 2004. Our backlog ratio was 43% for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 47% for the fourth quarter of 2004. (Backlog ratio is defined as unit deliveries as a percentage of beginning backlog in the quarter.) Domestically, unit backlog of 20,240 units at November 30, 2005 increased by 24% compared to 16,357 units at November 30, 2004. Our overall expansion of operations and continued emphasis on pre-sales contributed to the increase in domestic backlog levels. Net orders generated by our U.S. operations totaled 9,747 in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 14% from 8,516 in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net orders in France totaled 2,237 in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 30% from 1,716 in the year-earlier quarter. Unit backlog of 5,482 in France was 40% higher at November 30, 2005 compared to the 3,923 unit backlog at November 30, 2004. 9 The following table sets forth unit deliveries, net orders and ending backlog relating to sales of homes and homes under contract for each quarter during the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004.

Similarly, ending backlog at November 30, 2003 combined with net order and delivery activity for 2004 will not equal the ending backlog at November 30, 2004. 10 Land and Raw Materials We believe that our current supply of land is sufficient for our reasonably anticipated needs over the next several years, and that we will be able to acquire land on acceptable terms for future communities absent significant changes in current land acquisition market conditions. The principal raw materials used in the construction of our homes are concrete and forest products. (In France, the principal materials used in the construction of our commercial buildings are steel, concrete and glass.) In addition, we use a variety of other construction materials, including sheetrock, plumbing and electrical items in the homebuilding process. We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials which are commercially available on competitive terms from a variety of sources. In addition, our centralized or regionalized purchasing of certain building materials, appliances and fixtures allows us to benefit from large quantity purchase discounts and, in some cases, supplier rebates, for our domestic operations. When possible, we make bulk purchases of such products at favorable prices from suppliers and often instruct subcontractors to submit bids based on such prices. Land Sales In the normal course of business, we occasionally sell land which either can be sold at an advantageous price due to market conditions or does not meet our marketing needs. Such property may consist of land zoned for commercial use which is part of a larger parcel being developed for single-family homes or may be in areas where we may consider our inventory to be excessive. Generally, land sales fluctuate with our decisions to maintain or decrease our land ownership position in certain markets based upon the volume of our holdings, the strength and number of competing developers entering particular markets at given points in time, the availability of land in markets we serve and prevailing market conditions. Such sales have been limited in recent years. Land sale revenues totaled $40.3 million in 2005, $27.9 million in 2004 and $25.6 million in 2003. Customer Financing On-site personnel at our communities in the United States facilitate sales by offering to arrange financing for prospective customers through Countrywide KB Home Loans. We believe that the ability of Countrywide KB Home Loans to offer customers a variety of financing options on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales. Countrywide KB Home Loans is a retail mortgage banking joint venture providing mortgage banking services to our domestic homebuyers. Leveraging the resources of Countrywide, the joint venture operates with decentralized teams of employees located in all of our markets. Through its relationship with Countrywide, the joint venture offers virtually every loan program in the industry as well as some products not offered by other lenders. This includes fixed and adjustable rate, conventional, privately insured mortgages, Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured or Veterans Administration (VA)-guaranteed mortgages and mortgages funded by revenue bond programs of states and municipalities. Prior to establishing Countrywide KB Home Loans on September 1, 2005, we offered mortgage banking services directly through KBHMC, which provided our domestic homebuyers with financing, and coordinated loan originations through the steps of loan application, loan approval and closing. KBHMCs principal sources of revenues were: (i) interest income earned on mortgage loans during the period they were held by KBHMC prior to their sale to investors; (ii) net gains from the sale of loans; (iii) loan servicing fees; and (iv) revenues from the sale of the rights to service loans. KBHMC originated loans for 48%, 59% and 73% of our domestic home deliveries to end users who obtained mortgage financing in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. KBHMCs mortgage banking business was approved by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) as a seller-servicer of FHA and VA loans. A portion of the conventional loans originated by KBHMC (i.e., loans other than those insured by FHA or guaranteed by VA) qualified for inclusion in loan guarantee programs sponsored by Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). KBHMC customarily sold nearly all of the loans that it originated. Loans were sold either individually or in pools to GNMA, Fannie Mae or FHLMC or against forward commitments to institutional investors, including banks and savings and loan associations. KBHMC also typically sold servicing rights for substantially all of the loans it originated. However, 11 for a small percentage of loans, and to the extent required for loans being held for sale to investors, KBHMC serviced the mortgages that it originated. In France, we assist our customers by arranging financing through third-party lenders, primarily major French banks with which our French business has established relationships. In some cases, our French customers qualify for certain government-assisted home financing programs. Employees All our operating divisions operate independently with respect to day-to-day operations within the context of our KBnxt operational business model. All land purchases and other significant construction, financial services and similar operating decisions must be approved by senior management at the operating divisional and corporate levels. We employ a trained staff of land acquisition specialists, architects, planners, engineers, construction supervisors, marketing and sales personnel and finance and accounting personnel, supplemented as necessary by outside consultants, who guide the development of our communities from their conception through the marketing and sale of completed homes. Each operating division is given extensive autonomy regarding employment of personnel within policy guidelines established by our senior management. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately 6,700 full-time employees in our operations. No employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Construction personnel are typically paid performance bonuses based on individual performance and incentive compensation based on the performance of the applicable operating division. Corporate personnel are typically paid performance bonuses based on individual performance and incentive compensation based on our overall performance. Competition and Other Factors We believe the use of our KBnxt operational business model, particularly the aspects that involve gaining a deeper understanding of customer interests and needs and offering a wide range of choices to homebuyers, provides us with long-term competitive advantages. The housing industry is highly competitive, and we compete with numerous housing producers ranging from regional and national firms to small local builders primarily on the basis of price, location, financing, design, reputation, quality and amenities. In addition, we compete with housing alternatives other than new production homes, including used homes and rental housing. In certain markets and at times when housing demand is high, we also compete with other builders to hire subcontractors. Financing We do not generally finance the development of our domestic communities with project financing (by project financing we mean proceeds of loans specifically obtained for, or secured by, particular communities). Instead, financing of our domestic operations has been primarily generated from results of operations, public debt and equity financing, and borrowings under our domestic unsecured credit facility with various banks. Historically, KBSA has financed its business activities from results of operations, public debt and borrowings from its unsecured committed credit lines with a series of banks. The initial public offering of KBSA, completed in February 2000, provided our French business with additional capital to support its growth. Regulation and Environmental Matters It is our policy, as part of our due diligence process for all land acquisitions, to use third-party environmental consultants to investigate for environmental risks. and to require disclosure from land sellers of known environmental risks. Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that we will avoid material liabilities relating to the removal of toxic wastes, site restoration, monitoring or other environmental matters affecting properties currently or previously owned by us. No estimate of such potential liabilities can be made although we may, from time to time, purchase property which requires modest environmental clean-up costs after appropriate due diligence. In such instances, we take steps prior to acquisition to gain assurance as to the precise scope of work required and costs associated with removal, site restoration and/or monitoring, using detailed investigations by environmental consultants. To the extent such 12 contamination or other environmental issues have occurred in the past, we believe we may be able to recover restoration costs from third parties, including, but not limited to, the generators of hazardous waste, land sellers or others in the prior chain of title and/or insurers. Utilizing such policies, we anticipate that it is unlikely that environmental clean-up costs will have a material effect on our future results of operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental agency of any claim that any of the properties owned or formerly owned by us are identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as being a Superfund clean-up site requiring clean-up costs, which could have a material effect on our future financial position or results of operations. Costs associated with the use of environmental consultants are not material to our results of operations. Access to Our Information We file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the Internet at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. The public may also read and copy any document we file at the SECs public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the operation of the public reference room. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Our reports, proxy statements and other information can also be inspected at the offices of the New York Stock Exchange, 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005. We encourage the public to read our periodic and current reports. We think these reports provide additional information which prudent investors will find important. A copy of these filings as well as any future filings may be obtained, at no cost, through our website http://www.kbhome.com or by writing to our investor relations department at investorrelations@kbhome.com or at our principal executive offices. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the risks previously mentioned, the following important factors could adversely impact our business. These factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking and other statements that we make in registration statements, periodic reports and other filings with the SEC, and that we make from time to time in our news releases, annual reports and other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking and other statements made from time to time by our representatives. Our business is cyclical and is significantly impacted by changes in general and local economic conditions. Our business is substantially affected by changes in national and general economic factors outside of our control, such as:  short and long term interest rates;  the availability of financing for homebuyers;  consumer confidence (which can be substantially affected by external conditions, including international hostilities involving the United States or France);  federal mortgage financing programs; and  federal income tax provisions. The cyclicality of our business is also highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions that can occur on a local or regional basis, such as changes in:  housing demand;  population growth;  employment levels and job growth; and  property taxes. 13 Weather conditions and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, fires and other environmental conditions can harm our homebuilding business on a local or regional basis. Civil unrest can also have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business. Fluctuating lumber prices and shortages, as well as shortages or price fluctuations in other important building materials, can have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business. Similarly, labor shortages or unrest among key trades, such as carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers, can delay the delivery of our homes and increase our costs. Rebuilding efforts underway in the gulf coast region of the United States following the destruction caused by the two devastating hurricanes there in the summer of 2005 may cause or exacerbate shortages of labor and/or certain materials. The difficulties described above can cause demand and prices for our homes to diminish or cause us to take longer and incur more costs to build our homes. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because the price of each home is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as our customers typically sign their home purchase contracts before construction has even begun on their homes. In addition, some of the difficulties described above could cause some homebuyers to cancel their home purchase contracts altogether. The homebuilding industry has not experienced a downturn in many years, and new homes may be overvalued. Although the homebuilding business can be cyclical, it has not experienced a downturn in many years. Some have speculated that the prices of new homes, and the stock prices of companies like ours that build new homes, are inflated and may decline if the demand for new homes weakens. A decline in the prices for new homes would have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business. If new home prices decline, interest rates increase or there is a downturn in the economy, some homebuyers may cancel their home purchases because the required deposits are small and generally refundable. Our backlog numbers reflect the number of homes for which we have entered into a sales contract with a customer but not yet delivered. Those sales contracts typically require only a small deposit, and in many states (or as a matter of our business practices), the deposit is fully refundable at any time prior to closing. If the prices for new homes begin to decline, interest rates increase or there is a downturn in local or regional economies or the national economy, homebuyers may have financial incentive to terminate their existing sales contracts in order to negotiate for a lower price or to explore other options. Such a result could have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business and our results of operations. Our success depends on the availability of improved lots and undeveloped land that meet our land investment criteria. The availability of finished and partially developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation in land prices, and zoning, allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Home prices and sales activity in the particular markets and regions in which we do business impact our results of operations because our business is concentrated in these markets. Home prices and sales activity in some of our key markets have declined from time to time for market-specific reasons, including adverse weather or economic contraction due to, among other things, the failure or decline of key industries and employers. If home prices or sales activity decline in one or more of the key markets in which we operate, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and, as a result, our overall results of operations may be adversely impacted. Interest rate increases or changes in federal lending programs could lower demand for our homes. Nearly all of our customers finance the purchase of their homes, and a significant number of these customers arrange their financing through Countrywide KB Home Loans. Increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage 14 financing would increase monthly mortgage costs for our potential homebuyers and could therefore reduce demand for our homes and mortgages. Increased interest rates can also hinder our ability to realize our backlog because our sales contracts provide our customers with a financing contingency. Financing contingencies allow customers to cancel their home purchase contracts in the event they cannot arrange for financing at interest rates that were prevailing when they signed their contracts. Because the availability of Fannie Mae, FHLMC, FHA and VA mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing many of our homes, any limitations or restrictions on the availability of those types of financing could reduce our home sales. In 2005, 62% of the mortgages originated by KBHMC were conventional (most of which conformed to Fannie Mae and FHLMC guidelines); 10% were FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed (a portion of which were adjustable rate loans); 26% were adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) provided through commitments from institutional investors; and 2% were funded by mortgage revenue bond programs. In 2004 and 2003, 56% and 65%, respectively, of the mortgages originated were conventional; 17% and 24%, respectively, were FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed; 24% and 8%, respectively, were ARMS; and 3% and 3%, respectively, were funded by mortgage revenue bond programs. We are subject to substantial legal and regulatory requirements regarding the development of land, the homebuilding process and protection of the environment, which can cause us to suffer delays and incur costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict homebuilding activity in some regions or areas. Our homebuilding business is heavily regulated and subject to increasing local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, resource protection, other environmental impacts, building design, construction and similar matters. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that regulate these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of a specified project or a number of projects in particular markets. We may also experience periodic delays in homebuilding projects due to building moratoria in any of the areas in which we operate. We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. These laws and regulations may cause delays in construction and delivery of new homes, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, environmental laws may impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances whether or not the developer or owner of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of those substances. The presence of those substances on our properties may prevent us from selling our homes and we may also be liable, under applicable laws and regulations or lawsuits brought by private parties, for hazardous or toxic substances on properties and lots that we have sold in the past. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California, which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than other homebuilders with a less significant California presence. Because of our French business, we are also subject to regulations and restrictions imposed by the government of France concerning investments by non-French companies, such as us, in businesses in France, as well as to French and European Union laws and regulations similar to those discussed above. The mortgage banking operations of Countrywide KB Home Loans (like the operations formerly conducted by KBHMC) are heavily regulated and subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and quasi-governmental agencies. There are a number of federal and state statutes and regulations which, among other things, prohibit discrimination, establish underwriting guidelines which include obtaining inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts. A finding that we or Countrywide KB Home Loans materially violated any of the foregoing laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are subject to a Consent Order that we entered into with the Federal Trade Commission in 1979. Pursuant to the Consent Order, we provide explicit warranties on the quality of our homes, follow certain guidelines in advertising and provide certain disclosures to prospective purchasers of our homes. A finding that we have significantly violated the Consent Order could result in substantial liabilities or penalties and could limit our ability to sell homes in certain markets. 15 We build homes in highly competitive markets, which could hurt our future operating results. We compete in each of our markets with a number of homebuilding companies for homebuyers, land, financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. Our competitors include other large national homebuilders, as well as smaller regional and local builders that can have an advantage in local markets because of long-standing relationships they may have with local labor or land sellers. We also compete with other housing alternatives, such as existing homes and rental housing. These competitive conditions can:  make it difficult for us to acquire desirable land which meets our land buying criteria;  cause us to offer or to increase our sales incentives or price discounts; and  result in reduced sales. Any of these competitive conditions can adversely impact our revenues, increase our costs and/or impede the growth of our local or regional homebuilding businesses. Changing market conditions may adversely impact our ability to sell homes at expected prices. There is often a significant amount of time between when we initially acquire land and when we can make homes on that land available for sale. The market value of a proposed home can vary significantly during this time due to changing market conditions. In the past, we have benefited from increases in the value of homes over time, but if market conditions were to reverse, we may need to sell homes at lower prices than we anticipate. We may also need to take write-downs of our home inventories and land holdings if market values decline. The design and construction of high density mixed use properties in urban areas in the United States present unique challenges, and we have limited experience in this business. Part of our homebuilding business includes our recent expansion into the urban market with our KB Urban division. We have a limited operating history in the United States in designing and constructing high density, mixed use properties that are the focus of KB Urbans operations. Among other risks, the success of KB Urban depends on our ability to accurately gauge this new market and customer demand for this type of housing. If KB Urban underperforms, or the KBnxt operational business model does not translate well to the urban market, our overall results of operations may be adversely affected. Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results fluctuate. We have experienced seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results. We typically do not commence significant construction on a home before a sales contract has been signed with a homebuyer. A significant percentage of our sales contracts are made during the spring and summer months. Construction of our homes typically requires approximately four months and weather delays that often occur during late winter and early spring may extend this period. As a result of these combined factors, we historically have experienced uneven quarterly results, with lower revenues and operating income generally during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year. Our leverage may place burdens on our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness, may restrict our ability to operate and may prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. The amount of our debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:  limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other requirements;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our debt and reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes;  impact our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; 16  place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors; and  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future performance. We are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic cycles. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our businesses could also be affected by financial, political, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds through the sale of debt and/or equity securities, the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may also affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations, because borrowings under our bank credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. A higher interest rate on our debt could adversely affect our operating results. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all. Under the terms of our $1.50 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the $1.5 Billion Credit Facility), our debt service payment obligations are defined as consolidated interest expense. As defined, consolidated interest expense for the years ended November 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $183.8 million, $141.5 million and $118.8 million, respectively. The indentures governing our outstanding debt instruments and our bank credit facilities include various financial covenants and restrictions, including restrictions on debt incurrence, sales of assets and cash distributions by us. Should we not comply with any of those restrictions or covenants, the holders of those debt instruments or the banks, as appropriate, could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity. We may have difficulty in continuing to obtain the additional financing required to operate and develop our business. Our construction operations require significant amounts of cash and/or available credit. It is not possible to predict the future terms or availability of additional capital. Moreover, our outstanding domestic public debt, as well as the $1.5 Billion Credit Facility and the credit facilities of our French subsidiary, contain provisions that may restrict the amount and nature of debt we may incur in the future. Our bank credit facilities limit our ability to borrow additional funds by placing a maximum cap on our leverage ratio. Under the most restrictive of these provisions, as of November 30, 2005, we would have been permitted to incur up to $5.14 billion of total consolidated indebtedness, as defined in the bank credit facilities. This maximum amount exceeded our actual total consolidated indebtedness at November 30, 2005 by $2.94 billion. There can be no assurance that we can actually borrow up to this maximum amount at any time, as our ability to borrow additional funds, and to raise additional capital through other means, is also dependent on conditions in the capital markets and our credit worthiness. If conditions in the capital markets change significantly, it could reduce our sales and may hinder our future growth and results of operations. Our future growth may be limited by contracting economies in the markets in which we currently operate, as well as our inability to enter markets on a de novo basis or to find appropriate acquisition candidates. Our growth also may be limited by the consummation of acquisitions that may not be successfully integrated, or our de novo entry into markets that may not achieve expected benefits. Our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected if the markets in which we currently operate do not continue to support the expansion of our existing business or if we are unable to identify new markets for de novo entry or with suitable acquisition opportunities. Our inability to grow organically in existing markets or to expand de novo into new markets would limit our ability to achieve our growth objectives and would adversely impact our future operating results. Similarly, if we do consummate acquisitions in the future, we may not be successful in integrating the operations of the acquired businesses, including their product lines, dispersed operations and distinct corporate cultures, which would limit our ability to grow and would adversely impact our future operating results. 17 Because we build homes in France, some of our revenues and earnings are subject to foreign currency and economic risks. A portion of our construction operations are located in France. As a result, our financial results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro and changes in the French economy to the extent those changes affect the homebuilding market there. We do not currently use any currency hedging instruments or other strategies to manage currency risks related to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar or the euro. Item 1B.
