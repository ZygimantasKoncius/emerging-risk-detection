D. Risk Factors or in other parts of this annual report on Form 20-F. A. Operating Results Overview We believe we are the worlds leading international operator of premium schools. We have over 20,000 full time equivalent students (FTEs), from kindergarten through the end of secondary school (K-12), at our 31 premium schools in China, Europe, ME/SEA and North America. As of November 16, 2014, we had 20,020 FTEs and capacity of 26,587 seats, representing a utilization rate of 75%. Recent Developments On November 10, 2014, we announced the development of a 2,000 place campus for our school in Houston. The new campus is expected to open in 2016 and the school will close its current 1,000 place campus at that time. Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Key Performance Indicators We use the following key operating metrics to manage our schools: FTEs, capacity, utilization and revenue per FTE. We monitor FTEs on a weekly basis and the other operating metrics on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis, as we believe that they are the most reliable metrics for measuring the profitability of our schools. The table below sets out our key operating data for the periods indicated. For fiscal 2013 pro forma, the key performance indicators are presented as if our acquisition of WCL Group Limited (WCL Group) on May 22, 2013 had completed on September 1, 2012. 51 Table of Contents Year Ended August 31, 2012 2013 2013 2014 Actual Actual Pro forma Actual Full-time equivalent students (average for the period)(1) China 3,622 4,075 4,075 4,827 Europe 3,775 3,838 4,448 4,514 Middle East/South East Asia  2,112 3,363 5,230 North America  247 2,422 2,645 Sub-total 7,397 10,272 14,308 17,216 Loss making start-up schools(2) 783 7 69 97 Total 8,180 10,279 14,377 17,313 Capacity (average for the period)(3) China 5,360 5,375 5,375 6,964 Europe 4,342 4,496 5,160 5,322 Middle East/South East Asia  2,909 4,791 5,961 North America  318 3,180 3,280 Sub-total 9,702 13,098 18,506 21,527 Loss making start-up schools(2) 1,500 48 480 480 Total 11,202 13,146 18,986 22,007 Utilization (average for the period)(4) China 68 % 76 % 76 % 69 % Europe 87 % 85 % 86 % 85 % Middle East/South East Asia  73 % 70 % 88 % North America  78 % 76 % 81 % Sub-total 76 % 78 % 77 % 80 % Loss making start-up schools(2) 52 % 15 % 14 % 20 % Total 73 % 78 % 76 % 79 % Revenue per FTE (in $ thousands)(5) China 30.8 33.8 33.8 34.3 Europe 29.5 30.2 28.7 30.1 Middle East/South East Asia  16.1 16.4 16.4 North America  30.8 24.7 24.9 Sub-total 30.1 28.7 26.6 26.3 Loss making start-up schools 12.5 42.9 33.2 31.4 Total 28.4 28.7 26.6 26.4 (1) We calculate average FTEs for a period by dividing the sum of the number of FTEs at each calendar month end in the period by the number of calendar months in the period. (2) Loss making start-up schools are schools that have been open less than three years and incur an EBITDA loss. In fiscal 2012, loss-making start-up schools include our school in Abu Dhabi. In fiscal 2013 actual and pro forma, our loss making start-up schools include The British School of Abu Dhabi and our school in New York. In fiscal 2014 loss-making start-up schools include our school in New York. (3) We calculate average capacity for a period by dividing the total number of FTEs that can be accommodated based on existing classrooms at each academic calendar month divided by the number of months in such period. (4) We calculate utilization for a period as a percentage equal to the average FTEs for the period divided by average capacity for the period. (5) We calculate revenue per FTE for a period by dividing revenue from our schools for the period by the average FTEs for the period. Full-Time Equivalent Students. Because our schools derive substantially all of their revenue from tuition fees, the number of FTEs enrolled in our schools is critical to our operating performance and growth. As a result, we monitor the number of FTEs to measure the performance of our schools. We also monitor FTEs on a school-by-school basis to help plan capacity expansion and track local market trends. 52 Table of Contents We define a FTE as a student who is enrolled to attend school for the full school day, five days a week. For example, a student who enrolls for three full days a week equals 0.6 FTEs and a student who enrolls for five mornings a week equals 0.5 FTEs. We calculate average FTEs for a period by dividing the total number of FTEs at each calendar month-end in the period by the number of calendar months in the period. The number of same-school FTEs fluctuates throughout the academic year, as new students enroll or as current students depart. Our average FTEs have grown from 8,180 in fiscal 2012 to 17,313 in fiscal 2014. The increase resulted from growing enrollments at our schools and acquisitions of new schools. In addition to monitoring our FTEs, we also focus on the number of inquiries, visits and applications by prospective students at each of our schools and the number of applications that result in enrollments. In our experience, the ratios of inquiries to visits and of visits to enrollments are leading indicators of student enrollments. Thus, in our marketing and recruitment activities we seek to maximize the generation of inquiries, the conversion of inquiries into visits, of visits into applications and of applications into enrollments. Capacity. We calculate average capacity for a period by dividing the total number of FTEs that we can accommodate at each calendar month-end in the period by the number of calendar months in the period. We increased our average capacity from 11,202 places in fiscal 2012 to 22,007 places in fiscal 2014. The increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of new premium schools in China, Switzerland, Spain, Thailand, the United States, Qatar, Singapore and Cambodia and capacity expansion at our schools in China and Europe. Utilization. We calculate utilization for a period as a percentage equal to the ratio of average FTEs for the period divided by average capacity for the period. In fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014 we had average utilization of 73%, 76% and 79%, respectively. The increase in utilization was primarily due to the acquisition of a school in Thailand in fiscal 2012 which had a higher utilization rate than our historical average and increased enrollment across our schools in China in fiscal 2012 and 2013, partially offset by lower utilization at some acquired schools and incremental capacity additions. Revenue per Full-Time Equivalent Student. We calculate revenue per FTE for a period by dividing the revenue from our schools for the period by the average FTEs for the period. Revenue per FTE is impacted primarily by the tuition fees we charge at each of our premium schools and the revenue per FTE of new schools that we acquire relative to our other premium schools within those regions. Revenue per FTE, and therefore our revenue, is directly impacted by our ability to increase tuition fees year on year at each of our premium schools. A majority of our tuition fees are paid by expatriate employers, who we believe accept price increases because education allowances typically represent only a small percentage of an expatriates total compensation package. We believe self-funding expatriates and affluent local families accept our price increases because of the importance they place on a quality education for their children. As a result, we have been able to increase tuition fees at our premium schools at an average of approximately 4-5% per year over the last three years, which we believe to be in excess of the median rate of inflation in the markets where these schools are located. Almost all of our tuition fees are charged in the local currencies of the countries where the schools are located. Therefore, our revenue per FTE is subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between these local currencies and our reported currency, the US dollar. See Currency Translation. Acquisitions In the three years ended August 31, 2014, we acquired 17 schools in Switzerland, China, Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, the United States, Qatar and Spain; we continue to assess a pipeline of acquisition opportunities and look for new acquisition opportunities. 53 Table of Contents The following table shows our acquisitions during the three fiscal years ended August 31, 2014: Fiscal 2012 La Côte International School Switzerland September 2011 Regents International School Pattaya Thailand August 2012(1) Fiscal 2013 International College Spain Spain May 2013 Compass International School Doha, Gharaffa Qatar May 2013 Compass International School Doha, Madinat Khalifa Qatar May 2013 Compass International School Doha, Al Rayyan Qatar May 2013 Compass International School, Al Khor Qatar May 2013 The British School of Washington United States May 2013 The British International School of Boston United States May 2013 The British International School of Houston United States May 2013 The British School of Chicago United States May 2013 The British International School of Charlotte United States May 2013 World Class Learning Academy, New York United States May 2013 The British School of Guangzhou China July 2013(1) St. Andrews International School Bangkok Thailand August 2013(1) Fiscal 2014 Dover Court International School Singapore April 2014 Northbridge International School Cambodia July 2014(1) (1) Premium schools acquired during the summer months of July and August do not have a significant impact on the current fiscal year results as most school years commence on September 1, which is the first day of the following fiscal year, and revenue and direct teaching costs are not recognized during July and August in line with our accounting policies. Increased Focus on Premium Schools In fiscal 2012, we made a strategic decision to no longer bid on new learning services contracts and gradually phase out some of our existing contracts. As a result, our premium schools revenue, as a percentage of our total revenue, has grown significantly. In fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, revenue from our premium schools represented 84.7%, 91.2% and 96.2%, respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal 2014, other revenue, which is predominantly revenue from learning services, accounted for 3.8% of our revenue and contributed 2.6% of our Adjusted EBITDA (before the allocation of central and regional costs). In the three years ended August 31, 2014, we acquired 17 schools in Switzerland, China, Thailand, the United States, Qatar, Spain, Singapore and Cambodia and have expanded capacity at our schools in China, ME/SEA and Europe. In September 2014, we opened new schools in Hong Kong and Dubai. We expect to further expand our network of premium schools and increase capacity at existing schools. Macroeconomic Conditions The results of our operations are indirectly affected by general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we operate, which may influence the demand for premium schools education and the tuition fees we are able to charge at our schools. As a result of the importance parents place on education in the markets in which we operate and the relative resilience shown by expatriate flows during difficult economic conditions, we believe our revenue and profitability are resilient to fluctuations as a result of macro-economic conditions. We have grown our business significantly since 2008 despite a challenging global economic climate. Total enrollment in our schools has grown at a CAGR of 29% from the end of fiscal 2008 to the end of fiscal 2014, and we have raised our tuition fees by an average of approximately 4-5% over the last three years. Currency Translation We conduct our business in several major currencies, most notably the Chinese renminbi, Swiss franc, Polish zloty, pound sterling, U.A.E. dirham, Qatari riyal, Euro, Thai baht, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, Cambodian riel and U.S. dollar, while our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Prior to our acquisition of WCL Group in May 2013, almost all of our revenue was recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and our other operating currencies affect the translation of our results and the net assets or liabilities of our overseas entities into U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2012, all of our material operating currencies except the Chinese renminbi weakened against the U.S. dollar which negatively influenced our results in that period. 54 Table of Contents In fiscal 2013, there was a more mixed impact with the Chinese renminbi, the Polish zloty and Thai baht all strengthening against the US dollar while the British pound and the Swiss franc weakened against the dollar. Overall, the impact of these movements positively influenced our results in that period. In fiscal 2014, there was also a mixed impact with the Chinese renminbi, the Polish zloty, British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc all strengthening against the US dollar while the Thai baht weakened against the dollar. Overall, the impact of these movements positively influenced our results in that period. Substantially all of our revenues and costs are denominated in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. We recognize translational gains and losses primarily upon the conversion of our foreign currency denominated earnings into U.S. dollars through other comprehensive income. Supplementary Financial Data The following table sets forth certain supplementary financial data for the periods indicated. The pro forma financial data for the year ended August 31, 2013 give effect to our acquisition of WCL Group as though it had occurred on September 1, 2012.

We define EBITDA as (loss)/profit for the period plus income tax expense, net financing (expense)/income, exceptional items, impairment of goodwill, amortization and depreciation, and we define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the items set forth in the table below. We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the items in the table below. We define Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary share as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the period. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not standard measures under IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to cash flows, net income or any other measure of financial performance or as indicators of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities. We may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the future and certain of these items could be recurring. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA excludes EBITDA losses attributable to loss-making start-up schools that have been open less than three years. We consider this a more directly comparable supplemental financial measure for evaluating the performance of our schools. 55 Table of Contents Reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income Set forth below is a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, (loss)/profit for the following periods: Year Ended August 31, 2012 2013 2013 2014 Actual Actual Pro forma Actual (unaudited) (in millions of dollars, except per share data) (Loss)/Profit for the period (37.4 ) (23.3 ) (16.0 ) (90.4 ) Income tax expense 16.4 19.3 18.6 25.7 Net financing expense(1) 47.7 49.0 57.4 53.5 Exceptional items(2) 12.5 17.7 9.1 100.2 Impairment of goodwill(3) 10.7    Amortization 3.5 5.7 8.8 10.4 Depreciation 9.9 11.7 16.0 23.4 EBITDA 63.3 80.1 93.9 122.8 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment(4) 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.1 FX loss/(gain) (5) 4.6 (4.0 ) (1.8 ) (4.0 ) Pre-opening losses(6)    4.1 Loss making start-up schools(7) 2.0 (0.1 ) 0.8 0.8 Pre-acquisition and corporate structuring costs(8) 0.6  0.8  Share based payments(9) 0.6 0.1 6.4 3.1 Management fees(10)  3.3 3.3 1.2 Other 0.8 (0.1 ) (0.1 ) 0.1 Adjusted EBITDA 72.2 79.4 103.4 128.2 Depreciation (9.9 ) (11.7 ) (16.0 ) (23.4 ) Net Financing Expense(1) (47.7 ) (49.0 ) (57.4 ) (53.5 ) Income Tax Expense (16.4 ) (19.3 ) (18.6 ) (25.7 ) Tax Adjustments(11) (0.6 ) (0.8 ) (1.6 ) (2.0 ) Adjusted Net Income (2.4 ) (1.4 ) 9.8 23.6 Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share (in dollars)(12) Basic (0.03 ) (0.02 ) 0.13 0.28 Diluted (0.03 ) (0.02 ) 0.13 0.28 Pro forma Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share (in dollars) (13) Basic 0.24 Diluted 0.24 56 Table of Contents (1) On March 31, 2014 we drew down in full on a new $515.0 million term loan facility and using proceeds from the loan and our initial public offering, we discharged our obligations under the indentures governing our $490.0 million 10.25% senior secured notes and $150.0 million 8.50%/9.50% PIK toggle notes, both of which were fully redeemed as of April 14, 2014. The new term loan facility bears interest based on applicable margin percentages of 2.50% per annum for base rate loans and 3.50% per annum for LIBOR rate loans, provided that the base rate for base rate loans may not be lower than 2.00% and LIBOR may not be lower than 1.00%. Based on these interest rates, assuming our new term loan had been fully drawn during fiscal 2014, and that none of our notes were outstanding during fiscal 2014, we estimate that our net interest expense, before tax, would have decreased by approximately $25.0 million for fiscal 2014. (2) In fiscal 2011, exceptional items included expenses related to the relocation of our central services function to Hong Kong. In fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2013 pro forma, exceptional items included expenses primarily related to the acquisition of schools, including associated transaction and integration costs, and transaction management fees paid to Baring Private Equity Asia or its affiliates associated with our notes issuances. In fiscal 2014, exceptional items primarily related to the costs associated with our initial public offering and refinancing and expenses related to the acquisitions of schools, including associated transaction and integration costs. In fiscal 2014, we incurred exceptional charges of $89.9 million related to the redemption of our outstanding notes, including the release of $12.9 million of prepaid costs. (3) In fiscal 2012, impairment of goodwill included the non-cash impairment charge on the remaining balance of the goodwill relating to learning services in the Middle East. (4) In fiscal 2012 and 2013, includes loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment associated with the termination of learning services contracts in the UK. (5) Represents foreign currency translational gains primarily associated with our inter-company balances. (6) In fiscal 2014, includes the pre-opening costs associated with the opening of our schools in Hong Kong and Dubai in September 2014. (7) In fiscal 2012, represents the EBITDA losses attributable to our school in Abu Dhabi. In fiscal 2013 actual and pro forma, represents the EBITDA losses attributable to our schools in Abu Dhabi and New York. In fiscal 2014, represents the EBITDA losses attributable to our school in New York. (8) In fiscal 2012, represents costs associated with changes to our corporate structure and lending arrangements to enable us to acquire our schools in Switzerland. In fiscal 2013 pro forma, represents costs incurred by WCL Group in connection with our acquisition of WCL Group. (9) In fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, represents non-cash charges associated with equity investments in our company by members of our management. In 2013 pro forma, includes non-cash charges associated with share-based compensation of WCL Group. (10) Represents management fees paid to Premier Education Holdings Ltd. (11) Represents the tax impact associated with the exclusion of exceptional items and amortization in calculating Adjusted Net Income. (12) Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income for the period by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the period. For the years ended August 31, 2012 and 2013 the basic and diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding were 74.0 million. For the year ended August 31, 2014, the basic and diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding were 85.1 million. (13) Pro forma Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income for the period by the number of ordinary shares outstanding following completion of our initial public offering. On completion of our initial public offering on March 31, 2014, we issued 21.8 million ordinary shares and all previously existing preference shares and classes of ordinary shares were converted into 75.9 million ordinary shares of par value $0.01 per share. The basic and diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for fiscal 2014 would have been 97.7 million and 97.9 million ordinary shares, respectively. Principal Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue Revenue is recognized net of indirect taxes, returns, rebates and discounts. Sales of services which have been invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue are included on the balance sheet as deferred income and accounted for within trade and other payables. 57 Table of Contents School fee income School fee income comprises tuition fees and income from ancillary sources, including registration fees, examinations, school trips, bus transportation and lunch fees. School fee income is generally payable in advance, on or before the first day of each term. We generally recognize school fee income over the ten months of the school terms from September to June. Where we receive fees in advance of more than one term, the income is recognized over the months in the terms for which payment has been made. At a majority of our schools, our terms and conditions require a full terms notice of withdrawal for a refund of prepaid tuition. The final academic term at most of our schools starts in April of each year and historically we have had few requests for refunds. Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily represents direct educational expenses and consultancy expenses. Direct educational expenses primarily consist of salary and benefits for school principals, teaching staff and lecturers employed in our schools and the cost of teaching materials, school lunches, bus services and certain after school activities. Consultancy expenses include the cost of independent consultants we use in the delivery of our learning services contracts. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated expenses for our management, finance, human resources, marketing, education policy and administrative personnel at our corporate headquarters as well as regional teams in China, Europe, ME/SEA and North America. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include compensation and associated costs for our admissions and marketing personnel and other support staff in our schools and outside professional fees, legal fees, audit fees and fees for tax advisory, property costs, including the rent costs of our schools and other corporate expenses. Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due primarily to retranslation of currencies on our inter-company balances are also included in our selling, general and administrative expenses but are added back or deducted when calculating our Adjusted EBITDA, as are any gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses consist primarily of amortization and impairment charges on intangible assets, depreciation expenses and other non-operating expenses. Finance Income Finance income primarily consists of interest on bank deposits. Finance Expenses Finance expenses represent interest on borrowings and financial leases, shareholder loan notes and certain other miscellaneous interest costs. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense consists of corporate income tax in the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as withholding taxes on dividends. Income tax expense also includes a charge or credit for deferred tax. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily attributed to changes in the operating results of our subsidiaries, which are subject to various tax rates and tax concessions in their respective jurisdictions. 58 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those that require application of our managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments often as a need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from managements current judgments. We have described below the critical accounting policies that our management believes are the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our school year runs from approximately September 1 through to the end of June, with term 1 from September to December, term 2 from January to March and term 3 from April to June. School fees are payable in advance on or before the first day of each term. When fees are invoiced in advance for future months, they are deferred in the balance sheet and released to revenue in the month to which they relate. This policy reflects the profile of our service delivery across the fiscal year. Our direct learning costs are accrued and recognized on a similar basis. As our fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31, the majority of our earnings from our schools division are recognized over the first 10 months of the year, and on a quarterly basis three-tenths of our school fee income is recognized in each of our first three quarters, and one-tenth of our school fee income is recognized in our final quarter. This results in a significantly reduced operating profit for the fourth quarter compared to our first three quarters, while our indirect teaching costs and other costs are recognized as incurred across each quarter. The revenue and costs of our learning services contracts and the costs of our central and regional support teams are recognized over 12 months. A degree of judgment is exercised where contracts have an element of revenue earned based on the delivery of contract milestones. Contract revenue and performance are monitored and any revisions to estimated revenue recognition are recorded in the period in which they are identified. Goodwill and Intangible Assets For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are generally grouped into geographic regions as this represents the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Intangible fixed assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment. Goodwill and brand names with indefinite lives are the only intangible assets that are not subjected to amortization. Assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalized separately from goodwill if those assets are identifiable and their fair value can be measured reliably. The initial identification of intangible assets requires considerable judgment in respect to the classification of the assets and in the assessment of their life. In addition, when assessing the values of the intangible assets, management is required to exercise judgment in determining the future profitability and cash flows of those assets, royalty rates, life of customer base and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. Pensions We maintain three defined benefit plans in the UK and similar arrangements in our schools in Switzerland and Thailand, for which we have recorded a pension liability. This liability is based upon an actuarial valuation that requires a number of assumptions including discount rate, mortality rates and actual returns on plan assets that may necessitate material adjustments to the liability in the future. The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions. Details of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the recognized liability for the plans are given in note 18 of the audited financial statements for fiscal 2014, which is included elsewhere in this annual report. 59 Table of Contents Taxation We are subject to income and other taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income and other taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities for anticipated issues arising from tax audits based on our estimates of whether additional taxes might become due. The amount of such liabilities is based on an assessment of several factors, including experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of local tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions on future possible events and involves a series of complex judgments. To the extent that the final outcome is different from the amounts recognized, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future against which the reversal of temporary timing differences can be deducted. Where the temporary differences relate to losses, the availability of the losses to offset against future forecast taxable profits is also considered. Recognition therefore involves judgment regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognized. Share-Based Compensation The Group operates an equity settled share based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services received under share-based compensation plans is recognized as an expense in the income statement. Fair value is calculated by using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model for share option schemes and the Binomial method for long term incentive plans. The amount charged over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered within the assumptions to estimate the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognized in the income statement over the remaining vesting period with corresponding adjustments made to equity. The cash payment is accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity, except when the cash settlement exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments that would have been issued, for which such amount is recorded to expense. The application of both the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the Binomial method require the application of a number of judgments including, the following; volatility, risk free interest rate, expected life to exercise. Accordingly the recognition of the fair value expense of the employee services received under share-based compensation plans could vary if significantly different assumptions were applied to the valuation models. Seasonality Premium Schools results are subject to seasonal fluctuation. As outlined in the accounting policy for revenue recognition, school fee income is recognized over the school terms.

The rise was due to increased revenue from our premium schools, partly offset by a decrease in other revenue. Revenue from our premium schools increased $161.1 million, or 54.5% (51.9% on a constant currency basis), from $295.3 million in fiscal 2013 to $456.4 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily due to increases in FTEs and tuition fees and the impact of the schools we acquired in Bangkok, Guangzhou, North America, Qatar and Spain in fiscal 2013 and Singapore and Cambodia in fiscal 2014. $39.1 million of our premium schools revenue in fiscal 2014 was attributable to the schools we acquired at the end of fiscal 2013 in Bangkok and Guangzhou and the schools we acquired during fiscal 2014 in Singapore and Cambodia. On a pro forma basis, including the schools we acquired as part of the acquisition of WCL Group in North America, Qatar and Spain in fiscal 2013, our premium schools revenue would have increased by 19.3% (17.9% on a constant currency basis) from $382.7 million in fiscal 2013 to $456.4 million in fiscal 2014. Other revenue decreased $10.2 million, or 36.0%, from $28.4 million in fiscal 2013 to $18.2 million in fiscal 2014. This decrease was due to the completion of learning services contracts in Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia and reduced revenues from our remaining UK contracts. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased by $66.8 million, or 45.3% (43.2% on a constant currency basis), from $147.6 million in fiscal 2013 to $214.4 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased direct costs associated with the number of teachers added as a result of the schools we acquired in Bangkok, Guangzhou, North America, Qatar, Spain, Singapore and Cambodia. This cost of sales increase was partly offset by the lower cost of sales associated with the reduced learning services contracts, which resulted in a reduction in the number of consultants we employed. 61 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit increased $84.1 million, or 47.7%, from $176.1 million for the fiscal 2013 to $260.2 million in fiscal 2014, resulting in a gross profit margin of 54.4% for fiscal 2013 compared to 54.8% for fiscal 2014. The improvement in margin was largely due to the impact of tuition fee increases in excess of our cost inflation and increased enrollment within our existing schools. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses increased $41.4 million, or 43.1% (40.9% on a constant currency basis), from $96.0 million for fiscal 2013 to $137.4 million for fiscal 2014. SGA expenses for both periods include charges for largely unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, share-based payments and management fees. Adjusting for these items (see itemized adjustments in the Reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income table for relevant amounts), SGA expenses would have been $96.6 million for fiscal 2013 compared to $137.1 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of 41.9% and in line with the revenue increase of 46.6%. Depreciation & Amortization Expenses Depreciation expense increased $11.7 million, or 100.0%, from $11.7 million in fiscal 2013 to $23.4 million in fiscal 2014 due to the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. Amortization expense on intangible assets increased $4.7 million, or 82.5%, from $5.7 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $10.4 million in fiscal 2014 due to the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. Exceptional Expense Exceptional expense increased $82.5 million, or 466.1%, from $17.7 million in fiscal 2013 to $100.2 million in fiscal 2014. The charge of $100.2 million in fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of our IPO and refinancing completed in the third quarter, including charges of $89.9 million related to the redemption of our outstanding notes (including the release of $12.9 million of prepaid costs). We also incurred an exceptional charge of $2.5 million in connection with the transfer of our transactional banking and revolving credit facility from Barclays Bank PLC to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in January 2014. Net Financing Expense Net financing expense increased by $4.5 million, or 9.2%, from $49.0 million for fiscal 2013 to $53.5 million for fiscal 2014, due to the additional interest expense from the $165.0 million 10.25% senior secured notes issued on July 3, 2013 to refinance the WCL Group acquisition plus the full period impact of the issuance of our $150.0 million 8.50%/9.50% PIK toggle notes on February 8, 2013, partially offset by the reduced interest expense on the $515.0 million term loan facility following the completion of our IPO. The $515.0 million term loan and proceeds from our initial public offering were used to redeem the $490.0 million 10.25% senior secured notes and $150.0 million 8.50%/9.50% PIK toggle notes, both of which were fully redeemed as of April 14, 2014. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $6.4 million, or 33.1%, from $19.3 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $25.7 million in fiscal 2014, the increase primarily being due to the impact of higher profits in China. Loss for the Year As a result of the foregoing, our loss for the year increased from $23.3 million in fiscal 2013 to $90.4 million in fiscal 2014. 62 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased by $48.8 million, or 61.5% (60.2% on a constant currency basis), from $79.4 million for fiscal 2013 to $128.2 million for fiscal 2014. On a pro forma basis the increase was $24.8 million, or 24.0% (23.2% on a constant currency basis) due to growth in FTEs, tuition fee increases and the impact of the Bangkok, Guangzhou, Singapore and Cambodia acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the results of our loss making start-up schools. Adjusted Net Income Adjusted net income increased by $25.0 million from a loss of $1.4 million in fiscal 2013 to a profit of $23.6 million in fiscal 2014. Year ended August 31, 2013 compared to year ended August 31, 2012 Revenue Revenue increased $49.3 million, or 17.9% (17.2% on a constant currency basis), from $274.4 million in fiscal 2012 to $323.7 million in fiscal 2013. The rise was due to increased revenue from premium schools, partly offset by a decrease in other revenue. Revenue from our premium schools increased $62.8 million, or 27.0% (26.1% on a constant currency basis), from $232.5 million in fiscal 2012 to $295.3 million in fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily due to increases in FTEs and tuition fees, with $17.2 million the result of the full-year impact of revenue from the school we acquired in Pattaya, Thailand in August 2012, and $13.4 million from the partial year impact of schools we acquired through our acquisition of WCL Group. Other revenue decreased $13.5 million, or 32.2%, from $41.9 million in fiscal 2012 to $28.4 million in fiscal 2013. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased $21.1 million, or 16.7% (15.9% on a constant currency basis), from $126.5 million in fiscal 2012 to $147.6 million in fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily due to direct costs of $8.4 added as a result of the acquisition our school in Pattaya, Thailand in August 2012, direct costs of $5.4 million added as a result of our acquisition of WCL Group, and the additional direct expenses associated with the increased student numbers at our China schools. This cost of sales increase was partially offset by a decrease in the cost of sales associated with learning services due to the completion of certain contracts, which reduced the number of consultants employed by us. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased $28.2 million, or 19.0%, from $147.9 million in fiscal 2012 to $176.1 million in fiscal 2013 resulting in a gross profit margin of 53.9% in fiscal 2012 and 54.4% in fiscal 2013. The slight increase in our gross profit margin was mainly due to the decrease in the contribution of the lower margin learning services business from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11.4 million, or 13.5% (12.5% on a constant currency basis), from $84.6 million in fiscal 2012 to $96.0 million in fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily due to management fees of $3.3 million paid to Premier Education Holdings in fiscal 2013 which were not charged in fiscal 2012 and an increase in operating lease rental costs from $27.6 million in fiscal 2012 to $31.9 million in fiscal 2013, $0.8 million of which resulted from the acquisition of our school in Pattaya, Thailand, and $2.5 million from our acquisition of WCL Group. Following the IPO and the refinancing, we terminated our professional services and consultancy agreement with Premier Education Holdings. See Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsB. Related Party Transactions. In addition, there was a foreign exchange loss of $4.6 million in fiscal 2012 compared to a foreign exchange gain of $4.0 million in fiscal 2013. Finally, the last quarter of fiscal 2013 includes legacy head office costs of WCL Group because post-acquisition streamlining of corporate operations had not yet been completed in that quarter. 63 Table of Contents Depreciation & Amortization Expenses Depreciation expense increased $1.8 million, or 18.2%, from $9.9 million in fiscal 2012 to $11.7 million in fiscal 2013 due to the impact of acquisitions made at the end of fiscal 2012 and the acquisition of our school in Pattaya, Thailand in August 2013. There was no goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013 as the remaining goodwill against learning services was written-off in fiscal 2012, resulting in a decrease in impairment of goodwill of $10.7 million. This decrease was partially offset by increased amortization charges of $2.2 million, or 62.9%, from $3.5 million in fiscal 2012 to $5.7 million in fiscal 2013 due to the impact of acquisitions mentioned above. Exceptional Expense Exceptional expense increased $5.2 million, or 41.6%, from $12.5 million in fiscal 2012 to $17.7 million in fiscal 2013. Exceptional items in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 primarily relate to the costs of acquiring schools, including associated transaction and integration costs, and in fiscal 2012 a transaction management fee paid to Baring Private Equity Asia associated with the notes issuance in that fiscal year. Finance Income Finance income was $2.0 million in fiscal 2012 and $2.3 million in fiscal 2013 and was comprised primarily of interest on bank deposits. Finance Expenses Our finance expenses increased $1.6 million, or 3.2%, from $49.7 million in fiscal 2012 to $51.3 million in fiscal 2013 due to the higher interest expense on Nord Anglia Education (UK) Holdings plcs senior secured notes ($325 million of senior secured notes were issued on March 28, 2012 and $165 million additional senior secured notes were issued on July 3, 2013) and our 8.50%/9.50% PIK toggle notes ($150 million PIK toggle notes were issued on February 8, 2013) compared to the interest expense on a bank facility which was repaid in full in March 2012. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the reduced interest on shareholder loan notes following the redemption of all outstanding shareholder loan notes during fiscal 2012. Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense increased $2.9 million, or 17.7%, from $16.4 million in fiscal 2012 to $19.3 million in fiscal 2013, primarily due to tax payable on higher profits in China. Loss for the Year As a result of the foregoing, our loss for the year reduced from $37.4 million in fiscal 2012 to $23.3 million in fiscal 2013. Adjusted EBITDA Our Adjusted EBITDA increased $9.3 million, or 13.3% (12.5% on a constant currency basis), from $70.2 million in fiscal 2012 to $79.5 million for fiscal 2013 and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue decreased from 25.6% in fiscal 2012 to 24.6% for fiscal 2013. The decrease in the margin was primarily due to the effect of the lower margins of the schools we acquired in Thailand, North America, Qatar and Spain, which was partially offset by increased enrollment in our Chinese schools and increased tuition fees. Our pro forma Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2013 was $103.4 million, which represents an increase of 47.3% (46.3% on a constant currency basis) over our fiscal 2012 Adjusted EBITDA of $70.2 million, primarily due to the completion of the WCL Group acquisition. See Item 3. Key InformationA. Selected Financial Data. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the results of our loss making start-up schools. 64 Table of Contents B. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain information relating to our cash flows for fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014: Year Ended August 31, $ millions 2012 2013 2014 Net cash generated from/(used in) operating activities 51.7 12.3 (51.3 ) Net cash used in investing activities (27.9 ) (262.4 ) (87.3 ) Net cash (used in)/generated from financing activities (2.2 ) 307.9 133.7 Cash and cash equivalents (end of period) 108.5 171.1 166.2 Our on-going operations require the availability of cash to service debt, fund working capital needs, fund maintenance and capacity-expansion capital expenditure and expenses associated with the acquisition of schools We believe that our operating cash flows and available amounts under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months. Net Cash generated from/(used in) Operating Activities Net cash generated used in operating activities was $51.3 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to an operating profit before tax and non-cash expenses of $109.6 million and a cash inflow from working capital changes of $14.7 million, offset by tax paid of $25.2 million, interest paid of $73.4 million and the payment of $77.0 million in make-whole premium on redemption of our notes. This represents a decrease of $63.6 million from the $12.3 million net cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2013. The main reasons for the decrease was an increase in interest paid of $27.6 million and the payment of $77.0 million in make-whole premium on redemption of our notes. Net cash generated from operating activities was $12.3 million in fiscal 2013, primarily due to an operating profit before tax and non-cash expenses of $65.4 million and a cash inflow from working capital changes of $18.2 million, offset by tax paid of $25.5 million and interest paid of $45.8 million. This represents a decrease of $39.4 million from the $51.7 million generated in fiscal 2012. The main reason for the deterioration in net cash generated from operations was an increase in interest paid of $39.0 million and an increase in tax paid of $9.6 million, partly offset by an increase in working capital inflows in fiscal 2013. Net cash generated from operating activities was $51.7 million in fiscal 2012, primarily due to an operating profit before tax and non-cash expenses of $59.3 million and a cash inflow from working capital changes of $15.1 million, partly offset by tax paid of $15.9 million and interest paid of $6.8 million. Net Cash used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $87.3 million in fiscal 2014. This was primarily due to the net cash used in the acquisition of our schools in Singapore ($15.5 million) and Cambodia ($14.9 million) and capital expenditure of $53.6 million. Capital expenditure included the impact of the significant increase in the number of schools following our acquisitions in Thailand, China, North America, Qatar, Spain, Singapore and Cambodia as well as the refurbishment expenditure on our school in Hong Kong and the costs of our new schools in Aubonne and Dubai, which opened in September 2014. Net cash used in investing activities was $262.4 million in fiscal 2013. This was primarily due to the net cash used in the acquisition of the WCL Group ($107.0 million) and the schools in Guangzhou ($20.6 million) and Bangkok ($11.2 million). Additionally, as part of our acquisition of WCL Group, we repaid $98.2 million of WCL Groups third-party bank debt and shareholder loan notes. Capital expenditure in the year was $23.9 million, an increase of $12.6 million over fiscal 2012. This increase reflects expansion projects in our China, Central European and Houston premium schools as well as the significant increase in the size of the premium schools estate. 65 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $27.9 million for fiscal 2012. This was due to the net cash used in the acquisition of the La Côte International School ($1.0 million) and Regents International School Pattaya, Thailand ($16.7 million) and capital expenditure of $11.3 million. Net Cash generated from/(used in) Financing Activities Net cash from financing activities was $133.7 million in fiscal 2014. The inflow was primarily due to the IPO proceeds net of fees and expenses of $320.0 million and the draw-down of our new $515.0 million senior secured term loan in March 2014 offset by repayment of the notes of $640.0 million and the payment of $63.5 million to redeem preference shares and deferred shares on completion of the IPO. Net cash from financing activities was $307.9 million in fiscal 2013. This was primarily due to proceeds of $140.0 million from the issue of share capital to fund the acquisition of WCL Group and the issuance of our $150.0 million of 8.50%/9.50% PIK Toggle Notes due 2018. In addition, Nord Anglia Education (UK) Holdings plc issued a further $165.0 million of 10.25% senior secured notes due 2017 to partially finance the acquisition of WCL Group and our premium schools in Bangkok and Guangzhou. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.2 million in fiscal 2012. This was primarily due to proceeds from new loans ($25.7 million) and the payment of borrowing expenses primarily related to the issuance of Nord Anglia Education (UK) Holdings plcs 10.25% senior secured notes due 2017 ($26.0 million). Borrowings The following table sets forth our outstanding long-term debt as of August 31, 2014. August 31, 2014 (in millions of dollars) Term Loan 502.4 Revolving Credit Facility 20.0 Total debt 522.4 Less current maturities (23.2 ) Long-term debt 499.2 We entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC on March 21, 2012, which provided for borrowings up to an aggregate of $20.0 million. On July 23, 2012, Barclays Bank PLC increased its commitment under the revolving credit facility from $20.0 million to $30.0 million, and on March 28, 2013, Barclays Bank PLC increased its commitment from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. On January 13, 2014, Barclays Bank PLC transferred its commitments under the facility to HSBC Bank PLC. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at LIBOR/EURIBOR plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was 4.25% per annum, except that if no event of default has occurred and is continuing, the applicable margin was based on total net leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement) as set forth below: Total net leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement) Margin (%) per annum Greater than 4:1 4.25 Greater than 3.5:1 but less than or equal to 4:1 3.75 Less than or equal to 3.5:1 3.25 On January 13, 2014, we entered into an additional three-year senior secured revolving credit facility with The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, which provided for borrowings of up to $20 million. Borrowings under this facility bore interest at LIBOR/EURIBOR plus an applicable margin of 4.25% per annum. 66 Table of Contents On March 31, 2014, we entered into a new credit agreement for a $515.0 million term loan facility and a $75.0 million revolving credit facility. The borrower under the credit agreement is a newly formed U.S. domestic limited liability company wholly owned by us. On the same date, we drew down the term loan facility in full and using proceeds from the loan and our initial public offering, we discharged our obligations under the indentures governing Nord Anglia Education (UK) Holdings plcs $490.0 million of 10.25% senior secured notes due 2017 and our $150.0 million of 8.50%/9.50% senior PIK toggle notes due 2018, both of which were fully redeemed as of April 14, 2014. On March 31, 2014, we also repaid (and terminated) our senior revolving facilities described above. Our new credit agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, may restrict our ability to: · incur additional debt; · pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our shares; · make investments; sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; · enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; · consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; · enter into sale and leaseback transactions; · enter into transactions with our affiliates; and · incur liens. The credit agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. The new term loan facility bears interest based on applicable margin percentages of 2.50% per annum for base rate loans and 3.50% per annum for LIBOR rate loans, provided that the base rate for base rate loans may not be lower than 2.00% and LIBOR may not be lower than 1.00%. Based on these interest rates, assuming our new term loan had been fully drawn during fiscal 2014, and that none of our notes were outstanding during fiscal 2014, we estimate that our net interest expense, before tax, would have decreased by approximately $25.0 million for fiscal 2014. We incurred an exceptional charge of approximately $89.9 million related to the redemption of our notes in the three months ending May 31, 2014 (including the release of $12.9 million of prepaid costs). Revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest based on a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.25% depending on our net leverage ratio, plus the applicable LIBOR rate. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures were $11.3 million, $23.9 million and $53.6 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Our capital expenditures were primarily related to capacity expansion and maintenance. Our maintenance capital expenditures were $6.4 million, $10.8 million and $14.0 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We fund our capital expenditures primarily by cash generated from our operations, sale of shares, borrowings from commercial banks and the issuance of debt securities. We expect to fund future capital expenditures primarily by cash generated from operating and financing activities. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc. We do not conduct research and development activities. 67 Table of Contents D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events since August 31, 2014 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. We are sometimes required to provide bid or performance bank guarantees on certain of our learning service contracts. These bank guarantees provide legal evidence of our liability to our client or financial institution acting on their behalf, so that if we should default, the third party can require payment directly from the bank and we would be liable for the debt. As of August 31, 2014, we had $10.6 million in such guarantees. F. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of August 31, 2014: Contractual Obligations (in millions of dollars) Total Less than 1 year 1  3 years 3  5 years More than 5 years Long-Term Debt Obligations 522.5 23.2 9.8 7.4 482.1 Operating Lease Obligations 713.5 54.3 122.9 81.9 454.4 Purchase Obligations(1) 31.6 31.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 Other Long-Term Liabilities(2) 6.0 2.3 3.7 0.0 0.0 Total 1,273.6 111.4 136.4 89.3 936.5 (1) Purchase obligations represent committed purchases for services or goods that have not been received as at August 31, 2013.

The business address for each of our executive officers and directors is Level 12, St Georges Building, 2 Ice House Street, Central, Hong Kong. Employment Agreements We have entered into employment agreements with our senior executive officers. Under these employment agreements, each of our executive officers is employed until either we terminate, on three to 12 months notice, or the executive officer terminates, on either three or six months notice, such employment. We may terminate the employment for cause, at any time, without notice or remuneration, for certain acts of the executive officer, including but not limited to gross misconduct, gross incompetence or willful neglect in the discharge of the executive officers duties, a conviction for certain crimes or certain acts of dishonesty or fraud. These agreements do not provide for any special termination benefits, nor do we have other arrangements with these executive officers for special termination benefits. 70 Table of Contents Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the employment agreement is earlier terminated, in strict confidence and not to use, except as required in the performance of his duties in connection with the employment, any confidential information, trade secrets, technical data and know-how of our company or the confidential information of any third party, received by us. In addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by non-competition restrictions set forth in his or her employment agreement. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to, for a period of either three or six months following the termination of the employment agreement, (i) carry on or be employed, engaged, concerned or interested in any business in direct competition with our business and with which the executive officer was involved in the course of employment with us during the 12 months preceding termination; (ii) negotiate with, solicit business from or endeavor to entice away from us, any person or entity who to the executive officers knowledge has been our customer, client, agent or supplier or in the habit of dealing with us within 12 months prior to such executive officers termination of employment; (iii) undertake to provide in competition with us services similar to those with which the executive officer was concerned during the 12 months prior to termination to any of our customers, clients, agents or suppliers during the 12 months prior to termination with whom the executive officer had dealings; (iv) solicit, interfere with, tender for or endeavor to entice away from us any contract, project or business in which the executive officer had dealings during the 12 months prior to termination; or (v) interfere with, solicit or endeavor to entice away from us, any senior management within 12 months prior to termination of employment with whom the executive officer had dealings during the 12 months prior to termination. B. Compensation For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, we paid an aggregate of approximately $4.3 million in cash to our directors and executive officers. The total amount set aside or accrued by us to provide pension, retirement or similar benefits to our directors and our executive management employees with respect to the year ended August 31, 2014 was $0.0 million. We have established a discretionary bonus plan which enables the compensation committee to grant cash bonus payments to employees and executive officers based on the attainment of financial or operational objectives as well as individual performance and development objectives. Directors, other than Mr. Andrew Fitzmaurice, who participates in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Graeme Halder, who participates in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer, are excluded from this plan. The discretionary bonus plan is administered by, and any bonus payments are made at the sole discretion of, the compensation committee. Our directors and shareholders have authorized our 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan, which provides for the issuance of up to 9,800,000 of our ordinary shares. The following table summarizes the outstanding awards as of November 9, 2014 that we granted to our directors and executive officers and other individuals as a group: Number of Shares Covered by Award Aggregate Purchase price Exercise price Expiration Date Directors and Executive Officers Restricted shares 13,851 $ 7,500 N/A N/A 13,937 $ 139.37 N/A N/A Restricted share units 13,956 N/A N/A N/A Options 212,600 N/A $ 18.00 May 30, 2024 All other Plan Participants as a Group Options 236,100 N/A $ 18.00 May 30, 2024 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan We have adopted the Nord Anglia Education, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the 2014 Incentive Plan). The purpose of the 2014 Incentive Plan is to promote our success and enhance our value by linking the individual interests of our non-employee directors, employees and consultants to those of our shareholders by providing such individuals with an incentive for outstanding performance to generate superior returns to our shareholders. The 2014 Incentive Plan is also intended to provide us flexibility in our ability to motivate, attract, and retain the services of non-employee directors, employees and consultants upon whose judgment, interest and special effort we are largely dependent. The principal features of the 2014 Incentive Plan are summarized below. 71 Table of Contents Share Reserve and Award Limits Under the 2014 Incentive Plan, 9,800,000 of our ordinary shares have been reserved for issuance pursuant to a variety of share-based compensation awards that may be awarded under the 2014 Incentive Plan. The maximum number of our ordinary shares that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any person pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan during any calendar year will be 1,200,000 and the maximum amount that may be paid in cash to any one person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards payable in cash shall be $10.0 million. Such maximums will not, however, apply to the extent that the deduction limitation set forth in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 does not apply to us (because we are a foreign private issuer, are exempt under Section 162(m) transition rules or otherwise). In addition to the foregoing limits, no non-employee director will be granted awards pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan with an aggregate value (determined as of the date of grant under applicable accounting standards) in excess of $5.0 million during any fiscal year. Types of Awards The types of awards we may grant under the 2014 Incentive Plan include the options to purchase our ordinary shares at a specified price and in a specified period determined by our compensation committee. Under the 2014 Incentive Plan, we may also grant awards of our (1) restricted shares, (2) restricted share units, (3) performance awards, (4) dividend equivalents, (5) share payments, (6) deferred shares, (7) deferred share units and (8) share appreciation rights, under the terms and conditions determined by our compensation committee. · Share Options will provide for the right to purchase our ordinary shares at a specified price which, except as otherwise determined by the administrator, shall not be less than fair market value on the date of grant, and usually will become exercisable (at the discretion of the administrator) in one or more installments after the grant date, subject to the participants continued employment or service with us and/or subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance targets and individual performance targets established by the administrator. The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that share options may be granted for any term specified by the administrator that does not exceed ten (10) years. To the extent the share options are governed by US tax laws, the share options may be either non-qualified share options or incentive share options. Incentive share options (ISOs) will be designed in a manner intended to comply with the provisions of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and will be subject to specified restrictions contained in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Among such restrictions, ISOs will have an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of an ordinary share on the date of grant, will only be granted to employees, and will not be exercisable after a period of ten (10) years measured from the date of grant. In the case of an ISO granted to an individual who owns (or is deemed to own) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our capital stock, the 2014 Incentive Plan provides that the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value of an ordinary share on the date of grant and that the ISO must not be exercisable after a period of five (5) years measured from the date of grant. · Restricted Shares may be granted to any eligible individual selected by the administrator and will be made subject to such restrictions as may be determined by the administrator. Restricted shares, typically, will be forfeited for no consideration or repurchased by us at the original purchase price if the conditions or restrictions on vesting are not met. The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that restricted shares generally may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed or expire. Recipients of restricted shares, unlike recipients of share options, will have voting rights and will generally have the right to receive dividends, if any, prior to the time when the restrictions lapse; however, in the sole discretion of the administrator, any extraordinary dividends will not be released until restrictions are removed or expire. · Restricted Share Units may be awarded to any eligible individual selected by the administrator, typically without payment of consideration, but subject to vesting conditions based on continued employment or service or on performance criteria established by the administrator. The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that, like restricted shares, restricted share units may not be sold, or otherwise transferred or hypothecated, until vesting conditions are removed or expire. Unlike restricted shares, ordinary shares underlying restricted share units will not be issued until the restricted share units have vested, and recipients of restricted share units generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when vesting conditions are satisfied and the ordinary shares are released. 72 Table of Contents · Performance Awards (including performance share units and performance cash bonuses) may be granted by the administrator in its discretion to any eligible individual, and may include, without limitation, restricted shares the restrictions with respect to which lapse upon the attainment of specified performance goals, restricted share units that vest and become payable upon the attainment of specified performance goals, share bonus awards that become payable upon the attainment of specified performance goals and other performance awards that vest or become exercisable or payable upon the attainment of one or more specified performance goals. The value of performance awards, including performance share units, may be linked to any one or more specified performance criteria or other specific criteria determined by the administrator, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods and in such amounts as may be determined by the administrator. Performance awards, including performance share unit awards, may be paid in cash or in ordinary shares or in a combination of cash and ordinary shares. · Dividend Equivalents will represent the value of the dividends, if any, per ordinary share paid by us, calculated with reference to the number of ordinary shares covered by the award. The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that dividend equivalents may be settled in cash or ordinary shares and at such times as determined by the administrator. · Share Payments will be payments made to eligible individuals as authorized by the administrator in its discretion in the form of ordinary shares or an option or other right to purchase ordinary shares, and may be made as part of a deferred compensation or other arrangement in lieu of all or any part of compensation, including bonuses, that would otherwise be payable in cash to such eligible individual, and may be subject to a vesting schedule, including vesting upon the attainment of performance criteria, in which case the share payment will not be made until the vesting criteria have been satisfied. · Deferred Share Awards will represent the right to receive ordinary shares on a future date. The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that deferred shares may not be sold or otherwise hypothecated or transferred until issued. Deferred shares will not be issued until the deferred share award has vested, and recipients of deferred shares generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when the vesting conditions are satisfied and the ordinary shares are issued. Deferred share awards generally will be forfeited, and the underlying ordinary shares will not be issued, if the applicable vesting conditions and other restrictions are not met. · Deferred Share Unit Awards will be awarded to any eligible individual selected by the administrator, typically without payment of consideration, but may be subject to vesting conditions based on continued employment or service or on performance criteria established by the administrator. Each deferred share unit shall entitle the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share on the date the deferred share unit becomes vested or upon a specified settlement date thereafter. The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that, like deferred shares, deferred share units may not be sold, or otherwise transferred or hypothecated, until vesting conditions are removed or expire. Unlike deferred shares, deferred share units may provide that ordinary shares underlying the deferred share units will not be issued until a specified date or event following the vesting date. Recipients of deferred share units generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when vesting conditions are satisfied and the ordinary shares underlying the award have been issued to the holder. · Share Appreciation Rights (SARs) may be granted in the administrators discretion in connection with share options or other awards, or separately. SARs granted in connection with share options or other awards typically will provide for payments to the holder based upon increases in the price of our ordinary shares over a set exercise price. The exercise price of any SAR granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan generally will be at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. There are no restrictions specified in the 2014 Incentive Plan on the exercise of SARs or the amount of gain realizable therefrom, although the 2014 Incentive Plan provides that restrictions may be imposed by the administrator in the SAR agreements. SARs granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan will be settled in cash or ordinary shares, or in a combination of both, at the election of the administrator. 73 Table of Contents Eligibility The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that awards may be granted to individuals who will then be our non-employee directors, employees or consultants or the non-employee directors, employees or consultants of certain of our subsidiaries; provided, however, that in the United Kingdom awards may be granted only to employees of our company or subsidiaries. Plan Administration The compensation committee of our board of directors (or other committee as our board of directors may appoint) administers the 2014 Incentive Plan unless our board of directors assumes authority for administration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our full board of directors acting by a majority of its members in office conducts the general administration of the 2014 Incentive Plan with respect to awards granted to non-employee directors. The committee (or board of directors with respect to awards granted to non-employee directors) determines the terms and conditions of each grant, including but not limited to, the exercise, grant or purchase prices, any performance criteria, any reload provision, any restrictions or limitations on the awards, vesting schedules, lapse of forfeiture restrictions or restrictions on the exercisability of the awards, any acceleration or waivers thereof, and any provision related to non-competition and recapture of gain on the awards. Award Agreements Awards granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan are evidenced by award agreements that set forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each award. Share awards may be evidenced by way of an issuance of certificates or book entries with appropriate legends. The certificates and book entry procedures may be subject to counsels advice, stop-transfer orders or other conditions or restrictions where the plan administrator deems necessary to comply with the required laws and regulations. Transfer Restrictions The 2014 Incentive Plan generally provides that awards granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent of the administrator, pursuant to a domestic relations order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or similar non-US law, unless and until such award has been exercised, or the shares underlying such award have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares have lapsed. Forfeiture and Claw-Back Provisions The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that the administrator has the right to provide, in an award agreement or otherwise, or to require a holder to agree by separate written or electronic instrument, that: (1) (a) any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by the holder upon any receipt or exercise of the award, or upon the receipt or resale of any shares underlying the award, must be paid to the company, and (b) the award will terminate and any unexercised portion of the award (whether or not vested) will be forfeited, if (i) a termination of service occurs prior to a specified date, or within a specified time period following receipt or exercise of the award, or (ii) the holder at any time, or during a specified time period, engages in any activity in competition with us, or which is inimical, contrary or harmful to our interests, as further defined by the administrator or (iii) the holder incurs a termination of service for cause (as such term is defined in the sole discretion of the administrator, or as set forth in a written agreement relating to such award between us and the holder); and (2) all awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by the holder upon any receipt or exercise of any award or upon the receipt or resale of any shares underlying the award) will be subject to the provisions of any claw-back policy implemented by us, including, without limitation, any claw-back policy adopted to comply with the requirements of any applicable law, including without limitation the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent set forth in such claw-back policy and/or in the applicable award agreement. 74 Table of Contents Amendments or Termination The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that our board of directors or the compensation committee, as applicable, may terminate, amend or modify the 2014 Incentive Plan at any time and from time to time. However, the 2014 Incentive Plan generally requires us to obtain shareholder approval to the extent required by applicable law, rule or regulation (including any applicable stock exchange requirement), including in connection with any amendments to increase the number of shares available under the 2014 Incentive Plan (other than in connection with certain corporate events, as described below). The 2014 Incentive Plan provides that in the event of any changes affecting our ordinary shares or the price of our ordinary shares, the plan administrator may make proportionate and equitable adjustments to reflect such changes. Upon or in anticipation of a corporate transaction, including acquisition, disposal of substantially all or all assets, reverse takeover or dissolution or any other unusual or nonrecurring transaction or event, the plan administrator may, in its discretion, provide for the termination, replacement or assumption of awards granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan, make adjustments in the aggregate number and type of shares subject to the 2014 Incentive Plan or to the terms and conditions, including grant or exercise price or performance criteria applicable to awards outstanding on the date of such change to prevent dilution or enlargement of potential benefits intended to be available thereunder, or provide that the awards become exercisable, payable or fully vested. The 2014 Incentive Plan will expire and no further awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the date that the 2014 Incentive Plan was adopted. Securities Laws The 2014 Incentive Plan is designed to comply with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, to the extent applicable, any and all regulations and rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The 2014 Incentive Plan is administered, and share options will be granted and may be exercised, only in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations. We have filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the ordinary shares issuable under the 2014 Incentive Plan. Non-US Participants Certain employees, non-employee directors and consultants who provide services to us outside of the U.S. may receive awards under the 2014 Incentive Plan. In order to comply with the laws in countries other than the United States in which we (either directly or through subsidiaries) operate or have employees, non-employee directors or consultants, or in order to comply with the requirements of any foreign securities exchange, the administrator has the power and authority to: (a) determine which of our subsidiaries will be covered by the 2014 Incentive Plan; (b) determine which employees, non-employee directors or consultants outside the United States will be eligible to participate in the 2014 Incentive Plan; (c) modify the terms and conditions of any award granted to employees, non-employee directors or consultants outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws or listing requirements of any such foreign securities exchange; (d) establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable; and (e) take any action, before or after an award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals or listing requirements of any such foreign securities exchange. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2014 Incentive Plan provides that the plan administrator may not take any such action with respect to non-US participants if it would violate any applicable law. C. Board Practices Board of Directors Our board of directors consists of six directors. A director is not required to hold any shares in the company by way of qualification. A director may vote with respect to any contract or transaction in which he or she is materially interested provided the nature of the interest is disclosed prior to its consideration and any vote on such contract or transaction. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, mortgage its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and issue debentures or other securities whenever outright or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or of any third party. No director is entitled to any severance benefits upon termination of his or her employment with our company. 75 Table of Contents Cayman Islands law does not require our directors to be independent. We comply with the New York Stock Exchange requirement that our board comprises a majority of independent directors. Committees of the Board of Directors We have established three committees under the board of directors: the audit committee, the compensation committee and the corporate governance and nominating committee. We have adopted a charter for each of the three committees which can be found on the investor relations section of our website. Each committees members and functions are described below. Audit Committee. Our audit committee consists of Carlos Watson, Alan Kelsey and Jack Hennessy, all of whom satisfy the independence requirements of Section 303A of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Messrs. Watson and Kelsey also satisfy the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Mr. Watson is the chair of our audit committee and qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F. The purpose of the audit committee is to assist our board of directors with its oversight responsibilities regarding: (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) the independent auditors qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditor. The audit committee is responsible for, among other things: · selecting our independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by our independent auditors; · reviewing with our independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and managements response; · reviewing and approving all proposed related-party transactions; · discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and our independent auditors; · reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of our internal controls and any special audit steps adopted in light of material control deficiencies; · annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of our audit committee charter; · such other matters that are specifically delegated to our audit committee by our board of directors from time to time; · meeting separately and periodically with management and our internal and independent auditors; and · reporting regularly to the full board of directors. In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, our audit committee held four meetings. Compensation Committee. Our compensation committee consists of Alan Kelsey, Jack Hennessy and Kosmas Kalliarekos, all of whom satisfy the independence requirements of Section 303A of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Kelsey is the chair of our compensation committee. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things: · approving and overseeing the compensation package for our executive officers; · reviewing and making recommendations to the board with respect to the compensation of our directors; · reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our chief executive officer, evaluating the performance of our chief executive officer in light of those goals and objectives, and setting the compensation level of our chief executive officer based on this evaluation; and · reviewing periodically and making recommendations to the board regarding any long-term incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements, annual bonuses, employee pension and welfare benefit plans. 76 Table of Contents In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, our compensation committee held two meetings and passed three resolutions by unanimous written consent. Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Our corporate governance and nominating committee consists of Alan Kelsey, Jack Hennessy, Carlos Watson and Kosmas Kalliarekos, all of whom satisfy the independence requirements of Section 303A of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Hennessy is the chair of our corporate governance and nominating committee. The corporate governance and nominating committee is responsible for, among other things: · identifying and recommending to the board nominees for election or re-election to the board, or for appointment to fill any vacancy; · reviewing annually with the board the current composition of the board in light of the characteristics of independence, skills, experience and availability of service to us; · identifying and recommending to the board the names of directors to serve as members of the audit committee and the compensation committee, as well as the corporate governance and nominating committee itself; · advising the board periodically with respect to significant developments in the law and practice of corporate governance as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and making recommendations to the board on all matters of corporate governance and on any corrective action to be taken; and · monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our procedures to ensure proper compliance. In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, our corporate governance and nominating committee did not hold any meetings nor pass any resolutions by unanimous written consent. Duties of Directors In summary, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law: · duty to act in good faith in what the directors believe to be in the best interests of the company as a whole; · duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose; · duty not to improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion; · duty to exercise powers fairly as between different sections of shareholders; · duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and · duty to exercise independent judgment. In addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both: 77 Table of Contents · the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company; and · the general knowledge, skill and experience which that director has. As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings. Terms of Directors and Officers Shareholders permitted to exercise more than 50% of the voting power capable of being exercised at any general meeting are entitled, by notice in writing to the company from time to time, to appoint any natural person or corporation to be a director and to remove and/or replace any director. Unless re-appointed or removed from office pursuant to the preceding sentence, each director is appointed for a term expiring at our next-following annual general meeting. The directors may appoint any person to be a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director provided that the appointment does not cause the number of directors to exceed any number fixed by or in accordance with our articles of association as the maximum number of directors. The office of a director shall be vacated if: (a) the director gives notice in writing to the company that he resigns the office of director, (b) the director absents himself (without being represented by proxy or an alternate director appointed by him) from three consecutive meetings of the board of directors without special leave of absence from the directors, and the directors pass a resolution that he has by reason of such absence vacated office, (c) the director dies, becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors generally, (d) the director is found to be or becomes of unsound mind, or (e) all of the other directors (being not less than two in number) determine that he should be removed as a director, either by a resolution passed by all of the other directors at a meeting of the directors duly convened and held in accordance with our articles of association or by a resolution in writing signed by all of the other directors.
