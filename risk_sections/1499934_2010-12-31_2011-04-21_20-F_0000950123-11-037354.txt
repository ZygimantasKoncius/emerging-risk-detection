D. Risk FactorsRisks related to Doing Business in ChinaAll participants of our existing share incentive plan who are PRC citizens are required to register with the SAFE, and the failure to so comply could subject us and such participants to penalties. In addition, the State Administration of Taxation has issued a few circulars concerning employee share options. Under these circulars, our employees working in China who exercise share options will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiaries have obligations to file documents related to employee share options with relevant tax authorities and withhold the individual income taxes of employees who exercise their share options. If our employees fail to pay and we fail to withhold their income taxes, we may face sanctions imposed by tax authorities or any other PRC government authorities. Legal Restrictions on Dividend Distributions The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends paid by wholly foreign-owned enterprises is the Corporate Law, as amended on October 27, 2006. Under the Corporate Law, our subsidiaries in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, Chinese companies are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event these subsidiaries are liquidated. See Item 3D  Risk 55 Table of Contents FactorsRisk Related to Doing Business in ChinaWe rely principally on dividends and other distributions paid by our wholly owned operating subsidiaries in China to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow money or pay dividends to holders of our ADSs. 56 Table of Contents C.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under  Item 3.D. Key InformationRisk Factors  and elsewhere in this annual report. A. Operating Results Overview Our restaurant chain grew from 9 restaurants as of January 1, 2008 to 131 restaurants as of December 31, 2010, including 69 restaurants in Chongqing municipality and 45 restaurants in Sichuan province. Our revenues increased by 113.6% from RMB231.5 million in 2008 to RMB494.5 million in 2009 and by 50.9% from RMB494.5 million in 2009 to RMB745.9 million ($113.0 million) in 2010. We added 34 and 38 new restaurants respectively in 2008 and 2009, which contributed revenues of RMB152.0 million and RMB124.5 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We further added 50 new restaurants in 2010, which contributed revenues of RMB107.8 million ($16.3 million) in 2010. Our net income increased by 69.4% from RMB26.6 million in 2008 to RMB45.1 million in 2009 and by 39.3% from RMB45.1 million in 2009 to RMB62.8 million ($9.5 million) in 2010. We plan to increase the number of our restaurants to approximately 200 by the end of 2011. Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations Our financial condition and results of operations are mainly affected by the following factors: Number of restaurants in operation Our revenues are affected to a significant extent by the number of restaurants we have in operation. We generated substantially all of our revenues from sales at our restaurants. Accordingly, new restaurants have contributed substantially to our revenue growth. The table below shows the number of restaurants in operation as of the dates indicated: 58 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Number of Restaurants: Chongqing Municipality 31 48 69 Sichuan Province 8 22 45 Other Regions 4 11 17 Total 43 81 131 Restaurants incur various costs and expenses before they open, and newly opened restaurants typically incur materially greater operating costs during the first few months of their operations. Therefore, opening new restaurants may temporarily lower results of operations on a per restaurant basis, and the proportion of new restaurants we have in operation during any period may affect our overall results of operations. Comparable restaurant sales We believe that comparable restaurant sales are an important benchmark of our operations. As we continue to add new restaurants to our chain each year, we believe that comparable restaurant sales provide a meaningful period-to-period comparison of restaurant performance because they exclude increases that are due to the opening of new restaurants. We define comparable restaurants in comparable periods as restaurants that were open throughout the periods under comparison. For example, our comparable restaurants for years 2008 and 2009 are restaurants that were open throughout both 2008 and 2009. The table below shows our comparable restaurant sales for the period indicated: For the year ended December 31, For the year ended December 31, 2008 2009 2009 2010 Number of comparable restaurants 9 9 43 43 Revenues for comparable restaurants (in RMB thousands) 79,422 87,795 369,429 394,719 Percentage increase during comparable periods 10.5% 6.8% We are highly focused on increasing comparable restaurant sales through a variety of measures, including continuously expanding and updating our menu offerings to generate repeat business and attract new customers and carefully selecting restaurant sites in areas with high customer traffic. In addition, our restaurants regularly offer promotional discounts to attract more business. We believe that these efforts have had a positive impact on our revenues. Food and paper costs Food and paper costs are the largest component of our operating expenses, representing 49.7%, 48.4% and 47.1% of our revenues in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The following table shows the breakdown of our food and paper costs in 2008, 2009 and 2010: 59 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 2010 Cost % of revenue Cost % of revenue Cost % of revenue (In thousands of RMB, except percentages) Food and beverage 106,761 46.1 % 221,227 44.7 % 329,728 44.2 % Paper 8,310 3.6 % 18,130 3.7 % 21,694 2.9 % Total Food and Paper 115,071 49.7 % 239,357 48.4 % 351,422 47.1 % Our food and beverage purchases are generally determined by prevailing market prices in China. The prices of food in China rose significantly in 2007 and 2008. According to the National Bureau of Statistic of China, the PRC food price index, its food inflation indicator, experienced year-on-year increases of 12.3% and 14.3% in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Despite these rising costs, we have been able to pass the increased costs onto our customers by increasing prices and introducing food items with higher margin. In addition, with an increased number of restaurants, we stepped up our efforts to centralize supply and thus enhanced our bargaining power on pricing with vendors. The PRC food price index increased by 9.6% from December 2009 to December 2010, and we expect that the rate of increase will remain significant in 2011. We increased prices of our menu items in September 2010 to address the increase in costs of food in China. As a result of the expansion of our operations and the inflation pressure in China, we expect the food and paper costs to continue to increase in the future. Restaurant wages and related expenses Restaurant operations are highly service-oriented, and therefore our success, to a considerable extent, depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers and restaurant staff. We offer competitive wages and benefits to our restaurant employees to manage employee attrition. Restaurant wages and related expenses include wages, salaries and bonuses paid to employees of our restaurants and production facilities, as well as pension scheme costs and social welfare. The salary level of employees in the consumer food services industry in China has been rising in recent years. In addition, when we open new restaurants, we have to hire staff before restaurants are opened and thus we normally incur wages for those restaurants before they begin to generate revenue. As a result, our restaurant wages and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue from 14.3% in 2008 to 15.6% in 2009 and further to 16.0% in 2010. We expect our restaurant staff wages and related expenses to continue to increase as inflationary pressures in China drive up wages and as we continue to increase the number of our restaurants. Rental expenses We lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate our restaurants. Generally, most of our leases have initial lease terms of 5 to 10 years, with some granting us 60 Table of Contents an option to renew such lease terms upon re-negotiation of rental prices and other rental terms. Certain leases require contingent rent, determined as a percentage of sales as defined by the terms of the applicable lease agreement. Property rental prices in China have generally been rising since 2007, particularly in the larger and more developed cities where a majority of our restaurants are located. Our rental expenses were 7.8% of our revenues in 2008 and 2009 and increased to 8.6% in 2010. With the expansion of our operations, we expect our rental expenses to continue to increase in the future. We intend to continue to rely on leasing properties for our restaurants. Nonetheless, should appropriate opportunities arise, such as if the real estate on which some of our more mature and profitable restaurants become available, we may strategically purchase these properties to hedge against potential rises in rental costs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made, and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. The selection of critical accounting policies, the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of those policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors that should be considered when reviewing our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates. The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report. Lease Accounting Judgments made by management for our lease obligations include the length of the lease term, which includes the determination of renewal options that are reasonably assured. The lease term can affect the classification of a lease as capital or operating for accounting purposes, the term over which related leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized, and any rent holidays and/or changes in rental amounts for recognizing rent expense over the term of the lease. 61 Table of Contents These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used. Long-lived Assets We review our long-lived asses, particularly property and equipment, for impairment at the restaurant level. We use one year of operating losses as the primary indicator of potential impairment testing of these restaurant assets. If an indicator of impairment exists for any of the assets, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the primary asset for each restaurant is compared to that long-lived assets carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flow, we then determine the fair value of the asset and if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Inherent in reviewing the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets is the use of various estimates. First, our management must determine the usage of the asset. Impairment of an asset is more likely to be recognized where and to the extent our management decides that such asset may be disposed of or sold. Assets must be tested at the lowest level, generally the individual restaurant, for which identifiable cash flows exist. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings. Fair value is based upon discounted cash flows of the assets at a rate deemed reasonable for the type of asset and prevailing market conditions, appraisals and, if appropriate, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. If our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. Our estimates of cash flow are based on the current regulatory, social and economic climates where we conduct our operations as well as recent operating information and budgets for our business. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in laws and regulations, economic downturns, or other events affecting various forms of consumer spending and access to our restaurants. Goodwill Impairment Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. If we determine that the carrying value of our goodwill has been impaired, the carrying value will be written down. To assess potential impairment of goodwill, we perform an assessment of the carrying value of each individual restaurant at least on an annual basis or when events and changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of each individual restaurant below its carrying value. If the carrying value of an individual restaurant exceeds its fair value, we would perform the second step in our assessment process and record an impairment loss to earnings to the extent the carrying amount of the individual restaurants goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We estimate the fair value of each individual restaurant through internal analysis and external valuations, which utilize income and market valuation approaches through the application of capitalized earnings and 62 Table of Contents discounted cash flow. These valuation techniques are based on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the projected future operating results of the individual restaurant, appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rates. The significant assumptions regarding our future operating performance are revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal values. If any of these assumptions changes, the estimated fair value of our individual restaurant will change, which could affect the amount of goodwill impairment charges, if any. We have not recognized any impairment charge on goodwill for the periods presented. We are currently not aware of any impairment charge of the goodwill. Share-Based Compensation We adopted our 2009 share incentive plan in December 2009. The 2009 share incentive plan permits us to grant stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units to our employees, directors and consultants representing the right to acquire up to 7,720,000 ordinary shares. As of April 1, 2011, options to purchase 4,397,544 ordinary shares and 413,750 restricted shares are outstanding under this plan. We recognize share-based compensation expenses based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of the grant, with compensation expense recognized using a straight-line vesting method over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. The options we grant may contain early exercise feature, pursuant to which a grantee may exercise the option before it has vested. However, so long as an option remains unvested, all shares purchased upon early exercise remain subject to repurchase by us at the option exercise price if the grantees service with us terminates. Early exercised options are not considered to have been exercised, or to be exercisable, until this repurchase right has lapsed. We record the proceeds received from grantees on early exercise as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, which will be reversed when the underlying non-vested restricted shares vest. We have performed contemporaneous valuation of the options and restricted shares issued in 2010. The fair value of restricted shares is estimated based on the fair value of the ordinary shares on the grant date. The options are priced using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of our ordinary shares on the grant date, expected stock price volatility, forfeiture rate, risk-free rate and expected price multiple at which employees are likely to exercise stock options. We have used historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate. Expected volatilities are estimated based on the average volatility of comparable companies over a time period commensurate with the expected life of the options. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. In determining the fair value of our ordinary shares in each of the grant dates, we relied in part on valuation reports prepared by an independent appraiser based on data we 63 Table of Contents provided. These valuation reports provided us with guidelines in determining the fair value, but the determination was made by us. Determining the fair values of our ordinary shares requires making complex and subjective judgments regarding projected financial and operating results, our unique business risks, the liquidity of the ordinary shares and our operating history and prospects at the time of grant. Therefore, these fair values are inherently uncertain and highly subjective. The assumptions used to derive the fair values of the ordinary shares include:  no material changes in the existing political, legal, fiscal and economic conditions in China;  no major changes in tax law in China or the tax rates applicable to our subsidiaries in China;  no material changes in the exchange rates and interest rates from the presently prevailing rates;  availability of finance not a constraint on our future growth;  our ability to retain competent management, key personnel and technical staff to support our ongoing operations; and  no material deviation in market conditions from economic forecasts. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions and judgments would affect our calculation of the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares for the options granted, and the valuation results and the amount of share-based compensation would also vary accordingly. We also estimate expected forfeitures and recognize compensation cost only for those share-based awards expected to vest. Amortization of Share-based compensation is presented in the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the cash compensation of those employees receiving the award. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is required to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on a more-likely-than-not 64 Table of Contents realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with operating loss in the China fast food industry, tax planning strategy implemented and other tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2010, we had deferred tax assets of RMB4.8 million ($0.7 million) generated from net loss carryforward before valuation allowance. We expect many of our restaurants that were put in operation during 2008, 2009 and 2010 will become mature and generate sufficient taxable profit to utilize the substantial portion of the net loss carryforward. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Our tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial reporting, we estimate the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, we refine the estimates of the years taxable income as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. We recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. Our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated. This information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. The results of operations in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.

This increase was due to:  an RMB24.2 million ($3.7 million) increase in revenues contributed by 43 restaurants opened prior to December 31, 2008;  an RMB119.4 million ($18.1 million) increase in revenues contributed by 38 restaurants added during 2009; and  an RMB107.8 million ($16.3 million) in revenues contributed by 50 restaurants added in 2010. We increased the number of our restaurants from 81 as of December 31, 2009 to 131 as of December 31, 2010. 66 Table of Contents Food and paper Our cost of food and paper increased by 46.8% from RMB239.4 million in 2009 to RMB351.4 million ($53.2 million) in 2010, primarily as a result of the expansion of our restaurant chain. The increase in cost of food and paper was attributable to an increase in cost associated with food from RMB221.2 million in 2009 to RMB329.7 million ($50.0 million) in 2010, and an increase of cost associated with paper and other food packaging materials from RMB18.2 million in 2009 to RMB21.7 million ($3.3 million) in 2010. As a percentage of revenues, cost of food and paper decreased from 48.4% in 2009 to 47.1% in 2010. Restaurant wages and related expenses Our restaurant wages and related expenses costs increased by 54.8% from RMB76.9 million in 2009 to RMB119.1 million ($18.0 million) in 2010. The increase in restaurant wages and related expenses resulted from an increase in headcount due to the additional restaurants opened during 2010 and, to a lesser extent, from share-based compensation expenses of RMB1.5 million and an overall increase in the levels of salaries and other employee benefits in 2010. As a percentage of our revenues, restaurant wages and related expenses increased from 15.6% in 2009 to 16.0% in 2010, primarily due to new restaurants opened in the period as it took time for the new restaurants to ramp up sales while restaurant wages and related expenses were incurred during the ramp-up period. Restaurant rental expenses Restaurant rental expenses increased by 66.8% from RMB38.5 million in 2009 to RMB64.3 million ($9.7 million) in 2010, primarily as a result of the expansion of our restaurant chain and, to a lesser degree, the overall average rental increase in the markets in which we operated during the period. As a percentage of our revenues, restaurant rental expenses increased from 7.8% in 2009 to 8.6% in 2010, primarily because it took time for the new restaurants opened during the period to ramp up sales. Restaurant utility expenses Restaurant utility expenses increased by 50.4% from RMB31.1 million in 2009 to RMB46.7 million ($7.1 million) in 2010. Restaurant utility expenses were equal to 6.3% of our revenues in both 2009 and 2010. Pre-opening expenses Pre-opening expenses are expenses incurred prior to restaurant opening. Pre-opening expenses were RMB5.9 million ($0.9 million) in 2010. Management started to track these expenses during the third quarter of 2010, prior to which these expenses were recorded in other restaurant operating expenses. 67 Table of Contents Other restaurant operating expenses Other restaurant operating expenses increased by 15.1% from RMB28.8 million in 2009 to RMB33.1 million ($5.0 million) in 2010 (not including pre-opening expenses). As a percentage of revenues, other restaurant operating expenses decreased from 5.8% in 2009 to 4.4% in 2010. Were pre-opening expenses to be included in other restaurant operating expenses as was the case in 2009, other restaurant operating expenses would have been RMB 39.0 million ($5.9 million) in 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 142.0% from RMB13.4 million in 2009 to RMB32.3 million ($4.9 million) in 2010. Such increase was primarily due to an increase in the size of our operations, the increase in promotion and marketing expenses and, to a lesser extent, share-based compensation expenses. In particular, we continued to increase our headcount at the corporate headquarters level in 2010 to support our operations and manage our supply chain. As a result, the salaries, wages and other compensation expenses increased. We had share-based compensation expenses that were allocated to selling, general and administrative expenses in the amount of RMB4.2 million ($0.6 million) in 2010, as compared to nil in 2009. As a percentage of revenues, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 2.7% in 2009 to 4.3% in 2010. Depreciation Depreciation in 2010 amounted to RMB21.3 million ($3.2 million), representing an increase of 93.5% as compared to RMB11.0 million in 2009. Such increase in depreciation was primarily attributable to the increase in our total fixed assets as a result of the increase in the number of our restaurants and, to a lesser degree, the renovations undertaken at certain existing restaurants. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation increased from 2.2% in 2009 to 2.9% in 2010. Impairment and other lease charges Impairment and other lease charges are expenses incurred as a result of asset impairment and the closure of a restaurant and the processing facility. Impairment and other lease charges were RMB2.1 million ($0.3 million) in 2010 and nil in 2009, respectively. Income tax expenses Our income tax expenses increased by 25.1% from RMB11.6 million in 2009 to RMB14.6 million ($2.2 million) in 2010. The increase in our income tax expenses was primarily due to the increase in income before taxes. Our effective income tax rate decreased from 20.5% in 2009 to 18.8% in 2010, the higher effective tax rate in 2009 attributable to withholding tax paid on dividends. There were no such dividends paid in 2010. 68 Table of Contents Net income As a result of the above, our net income increased by 39.3% from RMB45.1 million in 2009 to RMB62.8 million ($9.5 million) in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues Our revenues increased by RMB263.0 million, or 113.6%, from RMB231.5 million in 2008 to RMB494.5 million in 2009. This increase was due to:  an RMB8.4 million increase in revenues contributed by 9 restaurants opened prior to December 31, 2007;  an RMB130.2 million increase in revenues contributed by 34 restaurants added during 2008; and  an RMB124.4 million in revenues contributed by 38 new restaurants added during 2009. We increased the number of our restaurants from 43 as of December 31, 2008 to 81 as of December 31, 2009. Food and paper Our costs of food and paper increased by 108.0%, from RMB115.1 million in 2008 to RMB239.4 million in 2009, primarily as a result of the expansion of our restaurant chain and, to a lesser degree, the overall average food price increase in China in 2009. The increase in cost of food and paper was attributable to an increase of RMB114.4 million in cost associated with food from RMB106.8 million in 2008 to RMB221.2 million in 2009, or an increase of 107.1%, and an increase of cost associated with paper and other food packaging materials from RMB8.3 million in 2008 to RMB18.2 million in 2009, or an increase of 118.2%. As a percentage of revenue, costs of food and paper decreased from 49.7% in 2008 to 48.4% in 2009. Restaurant wages and related expenses Our restaurant wages and related expenses costs increased by 132.5% from RMB33.1 million in 2008 to RMB76.9 million in 2009. The increase in restaurant wages and related expenses resulted both from an increase in headcount resulting from the additional restaurants opened during the year and, to a lesser extent, from an overall increase in the levels of salaries and other employee benefits. As a percentage of our revenues, restaurant wages and related expenses increased from 14.3% in 2008 to 15.6% in 2009, because it took 69 Table of Contents time for new restaurants to ramp up sales while restaurant wages and related expenses were incurred at a level similar to existing restaurants. Restaurant rental expenses Restaurant rental expenses increased by 114.8% from RMB17.9 million in 2008 to RMB38.5 million in 2009, which increased in line with the growth in our revenues. Restaurant rental expenses were equal to 7.8% of our revenues in both 2008 and 2009. Restaurant utility expenses Restaurant utility expenses increased by 125.6% from RMB13.8 million in 2008 to RMB31.1 million in 2009, mainly due to the increase in the number of restaurants in 2009. As a percentage of revenues, restaurant utility expense increased from 6.0% in 2008 to 6.3% in 2009. Other restaurant operating expenses Other restaurant operating expenses increased by 131.0% from RMB12.5 million in 2008 to RMB28.8 million in 2009. Such increase was primarily due to the increase in pre-opening expenses as a result of the opening of new restaurants, which caused increases in expenses for low-value consumables and other miscellaneous expenses. As a percentage of revenues, other restaurant operating expenses increased from 5.4% in 2008 to 5.8% in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 237.8% from RMB4.0 million in 2008 to RMB13.4 million in 2009. Such increase was primarily due to an increase in the size of our operations. In particular, we increased our headcount at the corporate headquarters level in 2009 to support our operations and manage our supply chain. As a result, the salaries and wages as well as travel cost increased. As a percentage of revenues, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 1.7% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2009. Depreciation Depreciation for 2009 amounted to RMB11.0 million, representing an increase of 285.3% as compared to RMB2.9 million in 2008. Such increase in depreciation was primarily attributable to the increase in our total fixture assets as a result of the increase in the number of our restaurants and the renovations undertaken at certain existing restaurants. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation increased from 1.2% in 2008 to 2.2% in 2009. 70 Table of Contents Income tax expenses Our income tax expenses increased by 113.8% from RMB5.4 million in 2008 to RMB11.6 million in 2009, which was in line with the growth in our operating income. Our income tax expenses for 2008 resulted from our income before tax of RMB32.1 million, which was subject to an effective income tax rate of 17.0%, reconciled from the EIT Law tax rate of 25.0% by a tax holiday of 6.5% and the effect of different tax rate of our operating entities operating in other geographic regions amounting to 3.2%, which is offset by, among other items: (i) the net tax effect of non-deductible expenses amounting to 1.0% and (ii) the effect of change in valuation allowance amounting to 0.9%. Our income tax expenses for 2009 resulted from our income before tax of RMB56.7 million, which was subject to an effective income tax rate of 20.5%, reconciled from the EIT Law tax rate of 25.0% by a tax holiday of 11.9% which is offset by, among other items: (i) the effect of change in valuation allowance amounting to 3.0% and (ii) the effect of different tax rate of our operating entities operating in other geographic regions amounting to 2.8%. Net income As a result of the above, our net income increased by 69.4% from RMB26.6 million in 2008 to RMB45.1 million in 2009. Inflation Inflation in China affected our results of operations in 2008 and 2010 in the form of rising food prices. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the annual average percent changes in the consumer price index in China for 2008, 2009 and 2010 were an increase of 5.9%, a decrease of 0.7% and an increase of 3.3%, respectively. The year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for February 2009, 2010 and 2011 were decrease of 0.7% and increases of 2.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we can provide no assurance that we will not be affected in the future by higher rates of inflation in China. For example, certain operating costs and expenses, such as food material, personnel expenses, real estate leasing expenses, travel expenses and office operating expenses, may increase as a result of higher inflation. As of December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents accounted for approximately 70.4% of our assets. High inflation could significantly reduce the value and purchasing power of these assets. We are not able to hedge our exposure to higher inflation in China. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. The ASU amends ASC 820 (formerly SFAS 157) to add new requirements for disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and (4) the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3. The guidance in the ASU is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which is 71 Table of Contents effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. In the period of initial adoption, entities will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes. However, those disclosures are required for periods ending after initial adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Management believes the adoption of ASC 820 does not materially impact us. In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-13, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a Share-Based Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying Equity Security Trades. The objective of this ASU is to address the classification of an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades. FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation, provides guidance on the classification of a share-based payment award as either equity or a liability. A share-based payment award that contains a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition is required to be classified as a liability. Under Topic 718, awards of equity share options granted to an employee of an entitys foreign operation that provide a fixed exercise price denominated in (1) the foreign operations functional currency or (2) the currency in which the employees pay is denominated should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition. However, U.S. GAAP do not specify whether a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades has a market, performance, or service condition. Diversity in practice has developed on the interpretation of whether such an award should be classified as a liability when the exercise price is not denominated in either the foreign operations functional currency or the currency in which the employees pay is denominated. ASU 2010-13 clarifies that an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entitys equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Management believes the adoption of ASC 817 will not materially impact us. In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28, which (1) does not prescribe a specific method of calculating the carrying value of a reporting unit in the performance of step 1 of the goodwill impairment test and (2) requires entities with a zero or negative carrying value to assess, considering qualitative factors such as those listed in ASC 350-20-35-30 (these factors are not all-inclusive), whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not a goodwill impairment exists, the entity must perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. For public entities, the ASU is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) that begin after December 15, 2010. Early application will not be permitted. Upon adoption (i.e., beginning of the entitys fiscal year), an entity that has a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying value must assess, on the basis of current facts and circumstances, whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If so, the entity must perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test on the day of adoption and record the impairment charge, if any, as a cumulative-effect adjustment through beginning retained earnings. Management believes the adoption of ASC 350 will not materially impact us. 72 Table of Contents On December 21, 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29 to address differences in the ways entities have interpreted ASC 805s requirements for disclosures about pro forma revenue and earnings in a business combination. The ASU states that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. In addition, the ASU expand(s) the supplemental pro forma disclosures under ASC 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The ASU is effective prospectively for business combinations whose acquisition date is at or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. Management believes the adoption of ASC 805 will not materially impact us. There are no other recent accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of the date of this report. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows and Working Capital To date, we have financed our operations and expansions primarily through cash flows from operations and proceeds from the issuance and sale of Series A preferred shares to investors and, more recently, the proceeds of our initial public offering in September 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had RMB612.6 million ($92.8 million) in cash and cash equivalents and we had no bank borrowings. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank deposits that are placed with banks and other financial institutions and which are either unrestricted as to withdrawal or use or have maturities of three months or less. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 (In thousands of RMB) Net cash provided by operating activities 39,539 72,169 89,798 Net cash used in investing activities (43,904 ) (50,395 ) (116,792 ) Net cash used in financing activities (2,436 ) (3,454 ) 571,654 Effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents (394 ) (3 ) (2,772 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (7,195 ) 18,317 541,888 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period 59,573 52,378 70,695 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the period 52,378 70,695 612,583 73 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 (In thousands of RMB) Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information: Payable for purchase of properties and equipment 3,911 13,490 12,317 Income tax paid, net 1,892 9,264 17,762 Payable for offering expenses   891 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB89.8 million ($13.6 million) in 2010, compared to RMB72.2 million in 2009.

Eligibility.

Our plan administrator by express provision in the award or an amendment may permit an award (other than an incentive share option) to be transferred to or exercised by certain persons related to the participant. Corporate Transactions. Except as may provided otherwise in an individual award agreement or any other written agreement entered into by a participant and us, in the event of a change-of-control or other corporate transactions, our plan administrator may determine to provide for one or more of the following: (i) each award outstanding under the plan to terminate at a specific time in the future and give each participant the right to exercise the vested portion of the awards during a period of time as determined by our plan administrator; or (ii) termination of any award in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of the awards; or (iii) the replacement of such award with other rights or property selected by the our plan administrator or the assumption of or substitution of such award by the successor or a parent or subsidiary of such company, with appropriate adjustments; or (iv) payment of award in cash based on the value of shares on the date of the corporate transaction plus reasonable interest on the award. Amendment and Termination of the Plan. With the approval of our board, our plan administrator may, at any time and from time to time, amend, modify or terminate the plan, provided, however, that no such amendment shall be made without the approval of the our shareholders to the extent such approval is required by applicable laws, or in the event that any amendment that increases the number of shares available under our plan, permits our plan administrator to extend the term of our plan or the exercise period for an option beyond ten years from the date of grant, or results in material increase in benefits or a change in eligibility requirements, unless we decides to follow home country practice. Early Exercise. The options contain an early exercise feature, pursuant to which the grantee may exercise the option before it has vested. However, so long as an option remains unvested, all shares purchased upon early exercise remain subject to repurchase by us at the 81 Table of Contents option exercise price if the grantees service with us terminates. Early exercise options are not considered to have been exercised, or to be exercisable, until this repurchase right has lapsed. As of April 1, 2011, we have issued a net of 161,750 ordinary shares upon early exercise of stock options and recorded the proceeds received as a liability which will be reversed when such non-vested restrictive shares vest.

Since the establishment of CSC China in September 2007, these nine restaurants have been directly operated by us. We purchased the operating assets of these nine restaurants in a series of transactions from our founders in 89 Table of Contents 2008 and 2009 for an aggregated price of RMB3.4 million. As these nine restaurants were under the common control of our founders, we consolidated the results of operations of these nine restaurants in our financial statements throughout the periods presented in our financial statements.

Holders of the ordinary shares may effect certain changes by ordinary resolution, including alter the amount of our authorized share capital, consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of larger amount than our existing share capital, and cancel any shares which have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person. Transfer of Shares Subject to the restrictions of our Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, as applicable, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our board. Our board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share which is not fully paid up or on which we have a lien. Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share unless (a) the instrument of transfer is lodged with us, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other evidence as our board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares; (c) the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required; (d) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred does not exceed four; (e) the shares transferred are free of any lien in favor of us; or (f) a fee of such maximum sum as the New York Stock Exchange may determine to be payable, or such lesser sum as our board of directors may from time to time require, is paid to us in respect thereof. If our directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal. The registration of transfers may, on 14 days notice being given by advertisement in such one or more newspapers or by electronic means, be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as our board of directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days. Liquidation On a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), assets available for distribution among the holders of ordinary shares shall be distributed among the holders of the ordinary shares on a pro rata basis. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately. 95 Table of Contents Redemption of Shares Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, we may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined, before the issue of such shares, by either our board of directors or by our shareholders by special resolution. Variations of Rights of Shares All or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, be varied either with the written consent of the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. Inspection of Books and Records Holders of our ordinary shares will have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records. However, we will provide our shareholders with annual audited financial statements. See H. Documents on Display. C.
