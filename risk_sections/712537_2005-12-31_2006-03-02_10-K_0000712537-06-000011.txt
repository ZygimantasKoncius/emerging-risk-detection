ITEM 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) First Commonwealth cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions that we will undertake in future periods. Federal and state regulatory approval must generally be received before the company could acquire a bank or bank holding company. First Commonwealth cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals would be granted. First Commonwealth could be required to sell banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. Difficulty in integrating an acquired company could cause First Commonwealth not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of our business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations could be greater than expected. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments First Commonwealth does not have any unresolved SEC staff comments.
