Risk Factors - Currency Fluctuations. Overview The Company is a natural resource company engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. At this stage the Company has no producing properties and, consequently, has no current operating income or cash flow. The Companys accounting policy under Canadian and US GAAP is to defer all direct costs related to the acquisition of mineral properties held or controlled by the Company and to expense all exploration relating to proven and unproven mineral properties and incurred. When a property is placed in commercial production, such deferred costs are depleted using the units-of-production method. Management of the Company periodically reviews the recoverability of the capitalized mineral properties. Management takes into consideration various information including, but not limited to, results of exploration activities conducted to date, estimated future metal prices, and reports and opinions of outside geologists, mine engineers and consultants. When it is determined that a project or property will be abandoned, then the costs are written-off, or if its carrying value has been impaired, then 29 the acquisition costs are written down to fair value. At December 31, 2008 the Company had $Nil acquisition costs deferred. At December 31, 2007 the Company recorded $18,314,000 as a recovery of Navidad exploration expenditures with a corresponding entry to Navidad Interest receivable; this amount was received in January and February 2008. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $Nil acquisition costs capitalized. During the year ended December 31, 2008, there was no exercise of options, warrants or agents warrants. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had reserved 1,666,670 common shares (2007  3,271,070; 2006  3,504,404) for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2006, Company completed a syndicated brokered private placement financing of 2,865,000 special warrants at $3.50 per warrant for gross proceeds of $10,027,500. Each special warrant entitled the holder to acquire one unit consisting of one common share and one half common share purchase warrant without payment of any additional consideration. All special warrants were converted into common shares and common share purchase warrants on May 25, 2006. Each full warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one additional common share in the capital of the Company at a price of $3.80 per share until March 21, 2010. In addition to a cash commission of 6% the underwriters were granted 171,900 agents warrants, representing 6% of the number of special warrants issued. Each agents warrant is exercisable for one share at a price of $3.80, for a period of twenty four months, expiring on March 21, 2008. As of February 28, 2007 no co mmon share purchase warrants or agents warrants had been exercised. During the year ended December 31, 2006, 335,000 common shares were issued on exercise of options for proceeds of $280,950. Cash on hand and short-term investments at March 31, 2009 were approximately $21,000,000. Results of Operations The following discussion of the results of operations of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company attached hereto and related notes included therein. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported a consolidated loss of $4,301,910 ($0.08 loss per share), a decrease of $20,980,742 from the income of $16,678,832 ($0.32 earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the loss in 2008, compared to the 2007 amount, can primarily be attributed to a $1,476,385 increase in operating expenses and a decrease of $19,504,357 from other income items. The Companys operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $3,778,385, a increase of $1,476,385 from $2,302,000 in 2007.

See Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions  Related Party Transactions.

(v) Navidad holding costs decreased $109,666 to $Nil. These were costs incurred in 2007 in order to maintain basic operations in Argentina subsequent to the transfer of control of the Navidad project to Aquiline. In 2008 the Company recorded interest income of $863,416 compared to $675,156 in 2007. A loss of $14,758 for foreign exchange was recorded in 2008 compared to loss of $8,324 in 2007.

The decrease in the loss in 2007, compared to the 2006 amount, can primarily be attributed to a $6,141,028 decrease in operating expenses and an increase of income $18,610,688 from other income items. The Companys operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2,302,000, a decrease of $6,141,028 from $8,443,028 in 2006.

In 2007 the Company recorded non-cash stock-based compensation of $34,421 compared to $393,120 in 2006, for stock options granted to its employees, consultants and directors. Other notable changes in the operating expenses are: (i) Administrative and management services decreased by $252,352 primarily as a result of decreased fees paid for the services of the president of the Company which included a bonus of $150,000 paid in 2006. See Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions  Related Party Transactions (ii) Corporate development and investor relations decreased by $160,962 primarily as a result of the Companys termination of its third-party investor relation contracts in 2006 as well as decreased investor relations activity during the year. (iii) Exploration decreased by $4,578,507, as the 2006 expenses included expenditures incurred for Navidad. (iv) Office and sundry increased by $56,307 as a result of increased insurance purchased during the year. (v) Salaries decreased $408,193 to $244,337 in 2007 due to a decrease in activity levels and bonuses paid in 2006 totalling $100,000.

The Company expensed all Navidad related holding costs from September 30, 2006 onwards. In 2006 the 31 Company funded costs during the transfer of the Navidad project in October and November. As the full amount of the costs agreed to, between the Company and Aquiline, were received ($18,500,000) a recovery of overhead costs in the amount of $550,479 was recorded in 2007. In 2007 the Company recorded interest income of $675,156 compared to $373,009 in 2006.

A loss of $8,324 for foreign exchange was recorded in 2007 compared to loss of $2,865 in 2006. In addition the Company also recorded $18,314,000 as a recovery of Navidad interest. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company reported a consolidated loss of $8,072,884 ($0.16 loss per share), a decrease of $5,297,482 from the loss of $13,370,366 ($0.29 loss per share) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in the loss in 2006, compared to 2005 amount, can primarily be attributed to a $5,310,698 decrease in operating expenses. The Companys operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $8,443,028, a decrease of $5,310,698 from $13,753,726 in 2005. Professional fees decreased $1,088,046 to $1,124,144 in 2006, as the Company incurred significant legal costs incurred in connection with the Aquiline legal action during and preceding the initial trial in 2005. The Companys 2006 legal fees primarily consist of costs incurred in preparing and proceeding with the appeal of the Aquiline judgment and costs relating to the establishment of the Interim Agreement. In 2006 the Company recorded non-cash stock based compensation of $393,120 compared to $2,960,000 in 2005, for stock options granted to its employees, consultants and directors, of which $393,120 is included in expenses in 2006 compared to $1,800,000 in 2005. Other notable changes in the operating expenses are: (i) Administrative and management services increased by $166,725 primarily as a result of increased fees paid for the services of the president of the Company (see discussion on related party transactions below). (ii) Corporate development and investor relations decreased by $167,759 primarily as a result of the Companys termination of its third-party investor relation contracts in 2006. (iii) Exploration decreased by $2,403,310 as a result of less expenditures incurred on Navidad project. (iv) Travel and accommodation decreased $162,643 due to decreased Navidad Project related travel by Company staff subsequent to the Aquiline judgment. (v) Salaries increased $66,970 due to higher staff costs in the year. (vi) Navidad holding costs of $312,349 were incurred in 2006 compared to $Nil in 2005 as a result of: i) costs incurred in order to maintain basic operations in Argentina subsequent to the transfer of control of the Navidad project to Aquiline; and ii) costs incurred in the period between the date of the judgment and the transfer of control of the Navidad project to Aquiline that would normally have been included in mineral properties and deferred costs. In 2006 the Company recorded interest income of $373,009 compared to $150,406 in 2005, primarily as a result of increase of funds on deposit. A loss of $2,865 for foreign exchange was recorded in 2006 compared to gain of $232,954 in 2005. The small foreign exchange adjustment in 2006 is a result of the relatively flat exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollars during the year. In 2005, the large gain was a result of strengthening of the Canadian dollar compared to US dollar and due to the exchange movements between expenses being incurred in US$ and amounts exchanged to settle such payables. 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys cash position at December 31, 2008 was $102,706, a decrease of $80,922 from December 31, 2007. Short-term investments increased $14,534,307 to $21,347,769 at December 31, 2008 from $6,813,462 at December 31, 2007. Total assets decreased to $22,684,599 at December 31, 2008 from $26,124,490 at December 31, 2007. This decrease is mainly due to the decreased cash and short-term investments. During fiscal 2006, Company completed a syndicated brokered private placement financing of 2,865,000 special warrants at $3.50 per warrant for gross proceeds of $10,027,500. Each special warrant entitled the holder to acquire one unit consisting of one common share and one half common share purchase warrant. All special warrants were converted into common shares on May 25, 2006. Each full warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one additional common share in the capital of the Company at a price of $3.80 per share until March 21, 2010. In addition to a cash commission of 6% the underwriters were granted 171,900 agents warrants, representing 6% of the number of special warrants issued. Each agents warrant is exercisable for one share at a price of $3.80, for a period of twenty four months, expiring on March 21, 2008. At December 31, 2008, no common share purchase warrants or agents warrants had been exercised. Stock options were exercised which resulted in cash proceeds of $Nil during 2008, compared to $59,500 during 2007. No warrants were exercised in 2008 or 2007. The Company has received $Nil from the exercise of options and warrants from January 1 to February 28, 2009. As at February 28, 2009, the Company had working capital of approximately $21 million. The Company considers that it has adequate resources to maintain its core operations for the next fiscal year. The Company will continue to rely on successfully completing additional equity financing to identify, acquire and conduct exploration and development of mineral exploration projects. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining the required financing. Except as disclosed, the Company does not know of any trends, demand, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, its liquidity either materially increasing or decreasing at present or in the foreseeable future.

The Company does not now and does not expect to engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations.

Mr. Atkinson was elected a director at the Companys annual general meeting of shareholders on December 9, 2008 There are no family relationships between any directors or executive officers of the Company. There are no known arrangements or understandings with any major shareholders, customers, suppliers or others, pursuant to which any of the Companys officers or directors was selected as an officer or director of the Company, other than indicated immediately above and at Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions - Related Party Transactions. Conflicts of Interest There are no existing or potential conflicts of interest among the Company, its directors, officers or promoters as a result of their outside business interests with the exception that certain of the Companys directors, officers and promoters serve as directors, officers and promoters of other companies, as set out below, and, therefore, it is possible that a conflict may arise between their duties as a director, officer or promoter of the Company and their duties as a director or officer of such other companies. The directors and officers of the Company are aware of the existence of laws governing accountability of directors and officers for corporate opportunity and requiring disclosures by directors of conflicts of interest and the Company will rely upon such laws in respect of any directors and officers conflicts of interest or in respect of any breaches of duty by any of its directors or officers. All such conflicts will be disclosed by such directors or officers in accordance with the BCBCA, and they will govern themselves in respect thereof to the best of their ability in accordance with the obligations imposed upon them by law. 35 All of the Companys directors are also directors, officers or shareholders of other companies that are engaged in the business of acquiring, developing and exploiting natural resource properties including properties in countries where the Company is conducting its operations. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. Such a conflict poses the risk that the Company may enter into a transaction on terms which place the Company in a worse position than if no conflict existed. The directors of the Company are required by law to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interest of the Company and to disclose any interest which they may have in any project or opportunity of the Company. However, each director has a similar obligation to other companies for which such director serves as an officer or director. The Company has no specific internal policy governing conflicts of interest. The following table identifies the name of each director of the Company and any company, which is a reporting issuer in Canada or the United States, and for which such director currently serves as an officer or director: Name of Director Name of Company Position Term of Service Joseph Grosso Golden Arrow Resources Corporation Chairman/President/CEO/Director Jul/04 to present Robert Stuart (Tookie) Angus Wildcat Silver Corporation Director May/06 to present Uranium North Resources Corp.

The following is a brief summary of these stock options and warrants currently outstanding and agreements. Stock Options The TSX-V requires all TSX-V listed companies to adopt stock options plans, and such plans must contain certain provisions. At the annual and extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of the Company held on June 26, 2003, the shareholders approved the Companys stock option plan (the Stock Option Plan). At the annual and extraordinary general meetings of shareholders of the Company held on June 24, 2004, June 23, 2005, June 14, 2006, December 4, 2007 and December 9, 2008, respectively, the shareholders approved and ratified by ordinary resolution the 2003 Stock Option Plan to make a total of up to 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of IMA available for issuance. The purpose of the Stock Option Plan is to provide incentive to the Companys employees, officers, directors, and consultants responsible for the continued success of the Company. The following is a summary of the Stock Option Plan. Administration of the Stock Option Plan The Stock Option Plan provides that it will be administered by the Companys Board of Directors or by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors consisting of not less than two of its members. The Stock Option Plan is currently administered by the Compensation Committee. Description of Stock Option Plan The effective date (the Effective Date) of the Stock Option Plan is June 2, 2003, the date the Board of Directors approved the Stock Option Plan, and it will terminate ten years from the Effective Date. The Stock Option Plan provides that options may be granted to any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. The options issued pursuant to the Stock Option Plan will be exercisable at a price not less than the market value of the Companys common shares at the time the option is granted. Market Value means: (a) for each organized trading facility on which the common shares are listed, Market Value will be the closing trading price of the common shares on the day immediately preceding the grant date less any discounts permitted by the applicable regulatory authorities; (b) if the Companys common shares are listed on more than one organized trading facility, the Market Value shall be the Market Value as determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) above for the primary organized trading facility on which the common shares are listed, as determined by the Board (or a committee thereof), subject to any adjustments as may be required to secure all necessary regulatory approvals; (c) if the Companys common shares are listed on one or more organized trading facilities but have not traded during the ten trading days immediately preceding the grant date, then the Market Value will be determined by the Board (or a committee thereof), subject to any adjustments as may be required to secure all necessary regulatory approvals; and (d) if the Companys common shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or over the counter market, the value which is determined by the Board (or a committee thereof) to be the fair value of the Companys common shares, taking into consideration all factors that the Board (or a committee thereof) deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the Company shares in private transactions negotiated at arms length. 47 Options granted under the Stock Option Plan will be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years from the date of their grant, provided that if the Company is then a Tier 2 company listed on the TSX-V, the term of the option will be not more than five years. Options under the Stock Option Plan will be subject to such vesting schedule as the Compensation Committee may determine. In the event that an option is to be terminated prior to expiry of its term due to certain corporate events, all options then outstanding shall become immediately exercisable for 10 days after notice thereof, notwithstanding the original vesting schedule. Options will also be non-assignable and non-transferable, provided that they will be exercisable by an optionees legal heirs, personal representatives or guardians for up to 12 months following the death or termination of an optionee due to disability, or up to 12 months following the death of an employee if the employee dies within 12 months of termination due to disability. All such options will continue to vest in accordance with their original vesting schedule. The maximum number of common shares to be reserved for issuance under the Stock Option Plan, including options currently outstanding, will not exceed 10% of the number of common shares of the Company issued and outstanding on the applicable date of grant. If a material alteration in the capital structure of the Company occurs as a result of a recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, or otherwise, the Compensation Committee shall make adjustments to the Stock Option Plan and to the options then outstanding under it as the Compensation Committee determines to be appropriate and equitable under the circumstances, unless the Compensation Committee determines that it is not practical or feasible to do so, in which event the options granted under the Stock Option Plan will terminate as set forth above. The TSX-V requires all TSX-V listed companies who have adopted stock option plans which reserve a maximum of 10% of the number of common shares of the Company issued and outstanding on the applicable date of grant, to obtain shareholder approval to the Stock Option Plan on an annual basis.
