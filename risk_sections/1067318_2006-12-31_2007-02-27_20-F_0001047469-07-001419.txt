RISK FACTORS Many factors could affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, political, social, industry, business and financial conditions. The principal risks are described below. Economic A decline in demand growth resulting, for example, from rising interest rates and fuel prices, could significantly adversely affect our businesses in our primary markets, the United States and Western Europe. The U.S. economy increasingly requires significant capital inflow from non-U.S. investors to finance its large current account deficit. A pronounced decline in demand for U.S. dollar denominated investments could lead to a sharp depreciation of the U.S. dollar and force the United States to raise its key interest rates, which would likely reduce demand for vehicles. A drop in economic growth in Western Europe, on the other hand, could result not only from a structural weakness or decline in domestic demand in major European economies, but also from a decline in the U.S. economy, which would likely result in less demand for European goods and services in the U.S. Sustained high energy prices could lead to declines in automotive sales if central banks try to limit inflationary pressure by substantially increasing interest rates. High fuel prices can also lead to a shift to smaller, lighter, more fuel-efficient cars, which generally provide a lower gross margin than larger vehicles, as well as to the deferral of purchases. The occurrence of any of these events in our primary markets, or other events that threaten consumer and investor confidence (for example international disputes, political instability, terrorism, significant declines in stock or housing markets) may significantly adversely affect our future sales. Since a high proportion of our costs are fixed, even small declines in sales can significantly affect our operating results and cash flows. An economic downturn in Asian economies could delay our plans for expansion in Asian markets and intensify competitive pressures. A decline in Asian economies could not only negatively affect future business prospects of our subsidiary Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation and our Mercedes-Benz passenger car sales, but also our long-term strategic expansion plans for growth in Asian markets. An economic downturn in China, in particular, could delay our expansion in that increasingly important market and could also negatively impact the economies in the United States and Western Europe. Moreover, if economic conditions in Asia were to deteriorate, especially if coupled with depreciating Asian currencies, then Asian competitors with excess capacity might intensify their efforts to export vehicles to North America and Western Europe. This would not only intensify competition for market share, but also increase further the existing pressure on margins within the automotive industry. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by economic or political change. We, in particular our Truck Group, our bus operating unit, and our Financial Services segment, have significant operations in several Latin American countries and in Turkey. Some of the countries in those regions may experience severe economic or political change, including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our investments as well as local demand in those and neighboring countries, thereby negatively affecting our cash flows and results of operations. Protectionist trade policies could negatively affect our business in certain markets. Demand for motor vehicles could also be affected by the political and regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate. For example, a discord in international trade relations and the implementation of 5 new tariff or non-tariff trade barriers could negatively affect our global sales and procurement activities as well as expansion plans in affected areas. The proliferation of bilateral free trade agreements between third party countries could negatively affect our position in those foreign markets, especially in Southeast Asia where Japan increasingly gains preferential market access. Industry and Business Overcapacity and intense competition in the automotive industry create pricing pressure and force further cost reductions. Intense price competition and overcapacity in the automotive industry could force manufacturers of passenger cars and commercial vehicles to decrease production, reduce capacity or increase sales incentives. Our ability to improve or even maintain our profitability depends, among other things, on the successful implementation of cost reduction and efficiency optimization programs and the achievement of sustainable price reductions from suppliers. Our ability to achieve such price reductions from suppliers may be limited by a combination of factors including consolidation among automotive suppliers, the use of a single supplier for certain components, and increasing supplier insolvencies. In addition, if we are unable to continue to provide competitive sales incentives, customers may elect to purchase competitors' products and our future profitability and cash flows may suffer. The revenues and operating results of the Chrysler Group are particularly sensitive to sales incentives because consumers in the U.S. and Canadian automotive markets have come to expect them. Sales incentives have become more common in West European markets as well. Sales incentives in the new vehicle business also influence the price level of used vehicles, which could adversely affect the profitability of our used vehicle sales and, indirectly, the profitability of our future new vehicle sales. Our future profitability and cash flows will depend on the ability of the Chrysler Group to improve revenues and reduce costs further and otherwise successfully implement its Recovery and Transformation Plan. The Chrysler Group's ability to increase sales in the NAFTA region could be limited in the short term if a shift in consumer demand toward smaller vehicles were to continue as a result of increased fuel prices or interest rates or other reasons, because trucks, sports utility vehicles and minivans comprise a significant portion of its current product portfolio. Historically, vehicles in those categories have generally been the most profitable. Further, the Chrysler Group faces increased pressure to reduce costs following the actions taken by its major U.S. competitors to restructure their North American automotive businesses through plant closures, workforce reductions and labor cost initiatives, including health care cost sharing on the part of union represented employees in the U.S. To date, the union has declined to support comparable reductions in labor costs for the Chrysler Group. Our ability to achieve cost reductions and operational flexibility through various measures such as facility closings, workforce reductions, scaled wages, and new work rules is limited under the collective bargaining agreement governing substantially all of the Chrysler Group's represented employees in the U.S. The agreement expires in September 2007. A prolonged work stoppage could occur in connection with negotiating the terms of a new agreement that could significantly adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. On February 14, 2007, the Chrysler Group announced its Recovery and Transformation Plan, the objective of which is to improve its financial performance and market position. The Chrysler Group's future profitability and cash flows depend on successful implementation of the plan.
