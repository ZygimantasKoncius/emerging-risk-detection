ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our structure as a limited partnership, our industry and our company could materially impact our future performance and results of operations. We have provided below a list of these risk factors that should be reviewed when considering an investment in our securities. These are not all the risks we face and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us: Our only assets are our partnership interests, including the incentive distribution rights, in ETP and, therefore, our cash flow is dependent upon the ability of ETP to make distributions in respect of those partnership interests. The amount of cash that ETP can distribute to its partners, including us, each quarter depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other things:  the amount of natural gas transported in ETPs pipelines and gathering systems;  the level of throughput in its processing and treating operations;  the fees it charges and the margins it realizes for its gathering, treating, processing, storage and transportation services;  the price of natural gas;  the relationship between natural gas and NGL prices;  the weather in its operating areas;  the cost of the propane it buys for resale and the prices it receives for its propane;  the level of competition from other midstream companies, interstate pipeline companies, propane companies and other energy providers;  the level of its operating costs;  prevailing economic conditions; and  the level of ETPs derivative activities. In addition, the actual amount of cash that ETP will have available for distribution will also depend on other factors, such as:  the level of capital expenditures it makes;  the level of costs related to litigation and regulatory compliance matters;  the cost of acquisitions, if any;  the levels of any margin calls that result from changes in commodity prices;  its debt service requirements;  fluctuations in its working capital needs;  its ability to make working capital borrowings under its credit facilities to make distributions;  its ability to access capital markets;  restrictions on distributions contained in its debt agreements; and  the amount, if any, of cash reserves established by its General Partner in its discretion for the proper conduct of ETPs business. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Because of these factors, we cannot guarantee that ETP will have sufficient available cash to pay a specific level of cash distributions to its partners. Furthermore, Unitholders should be aware that the amount of cash that ETP has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, ETP may make cash distributions during periods when it records net losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net income. Please read Risks Related to Energy Transfer Partners Business included in this Item 1A for a discussion of further risks affecting ETPs ability to generate distributable cash flow. We may not have sufficient cash to pay distributions at our current quarterly distribution level or to increase distributions. The source of our earnings and cash flow is cash distributions from ETP. Therefore, the amount of distributions we are currently able to make to our Unitholders may fluctuate based on the level of distributions ETP makes to its partners. ETP may not be able to continue to make quarterly distributions at its current level or increase its quarterly distributions in the future. In addition, while we would expect to increase or decrease distributions to our Unitholders if ETP increases or decreases distributions to us, the timing and amount of such increased or decreased distributions, if any, will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of the increase or decrease in distributions made by ETP to us. Our ability to distribute cash received from ETP to our Unitholders is limited by a number of factors, including:  interest expense and principal payments on our indebtedness;  restrictions on distributions contained in any current or future debt agreements;  our general and administrative expenses;  expenses of our subsidiaries other than ETP, including tax liabilities of our corporate subsidiaries, if any;  capital contributions to maintain our general partner interest in ETP as required by the partnership agreement of ETP upon the issuance of additional partnership securities by ETP; and  reserves our General Partner believes prudent for us to maintain for the proper conduct of our business or to provide for future distributions. We cannot guarantee that in the future we will be able to pay distributions or that any distributions we do make will be at or above our current quarterly distribution. The actual amount of cash that is available for distribution to our Unitholders will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control or the control of our General Partner. The General Partner is not elected by the Unitholders and cannot be removed without its consent. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our Unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence managements decisions regarding our business. Our Unitholders do not have the ability to elect our general partner or the officers or directors of our General Partner. Furthermore, if our Unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have little ability to remove our general partner. Our General Partner may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 % of our outstanding units. Because the equity owners of our General Partner and their affiliates (including Enterprise GP Holdings L.P.) own 109,386,633 Common Units, representing approximately 49% of our outstanding Common Units, it will be particularly difficult for our General Partner to be removed 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements without the consent of the equity owners of our General Partner and their affiliates. As a result, the price at which our Common Units will trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. A reduction in ETPs distributions will disproportionately affect the amount of cash distributions to which we are entitled. Our indirect ownership of 100% of the incentive distribution rights in ETP, through our ownership of equity interests in Energy Transfer Partners GP, the holder of the incentive distribution rights, entitles us to receive our pro rata share of specified percentages of total cash distributions made by ETP as it reaches established target cash distribution levels. We currently receive our pro rata share of cash distributions from ETP based on the highest incremental percentage, 48%, to which Energy Transfer Partners GP is entitled pursuant to its incentive distribution rights in ETP. A decrease in the amount of distributions by ETP to less than $0.4125 per Common Unit per quarter would reduce Energy Transfer Partners GPs percentage of the incremental cash distributions above $0.3175 per Common Unit per quarter from 48% to 23%. As a result, any such reduction in quarterly cash distributions from ETP would have the effect of disproportionately reducing the amount of all distributions that we receive from ETP based on our ownership interest in the incentive distribution rights in ETP as compared to cash distributions we receive from ETP on our General Partner interest in ETP and our ETP Common Units. Neither we nor ETP will be prohibited from competing with each other. Neither our Partnership Agreement nor the Partnership Agreement of ETP prohibits us from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with ETP or prohibit ETP from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, except that ETPs Partnership Agreement prohibits us from engaging in the retail propane business in the United States. In addition, we may acquire, construct or dispose of any assets in the future without any obligation to offer ETP the opportunity to purchase or construct any of those assets, and ETP may acquire, construct or dispose of any assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct any of those assets. Our consolidated debt level and our debt agreements and those of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to make distributions to Unitholders and may limit the distributions we receive from ETP and our future financial and operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $7.79 billion of consolidated debt outstanding, excluding the credit facilities of our joint ventures, which we guarantee in part. Our level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including, among other things:  a significant portion of our and ETPs cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and will not be available for other purposes, including payment of distributions;  covenants contained in our and ETPs existing debt arrangements require us to meet financial tests that may adversely affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business;  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general partnership purposes may be limited;  we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to similar companies that have less debt;  we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions as a result of our significant debt level; and  failure to comply with the various restrictive covenants of the debt agreements could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, including our ability to utilize the available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, and to pay distributions. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Completion of pipeline expansion projects will require significant amounts of debt and equity financing which may not be available to ETP on acceptable terms, or at all. ETP plans to fund its expansion capital expenditures, including any future pipeline expansion projects ETP may undertake, with proceeds from sales of ETPs debt and equity securities and borrowings under ETPs revolving credit facility; however, ETP cannot be certain that it will be able to issue ETPs debt and equity securities on terms satisfactory to ETP, or at all. In addition, ETP may be unable to obtain adequate funding under its current revolving credit facility because ETPs lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations. If ETP is unable to finance its expansion projects as expected, ETP could be required to seek alternative financing, the terms of which may not be attractive to ETP, or to revise or cancel its expansion plans. As of December 31, 2009, ETP had approximately $6.22 billion of total debt. A significant increase in ETPs indebtedness that is proportionately greater than ETPs issuances of equity could negatively impact ETPs credit ratings or its ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under ETPs revolving credit agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on ETPs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increases in interest rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition to our exposure to commodity prices, we have significant exposure to increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $7.79 billion of total debt. Approximately $6.06 billion of our consolidated debt bears interest at fixed interest rates and $1.73 billion bears interest at variable interest rates. We have entered interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $1.50 billion, resulting in a net amount of $234.0 million of variable-rate debt at December 31, 2009. We may enter into additional interest rate swap arrangements. As a result, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates. An increase in interest rates may also cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments, in general, and in particular for yield-based equity investments such as our Common Units. Any such reduction in demand for our Common Units resulting from other more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our Common Units to decline. The credit and risk profile of our General Partner and its owners could adversely affect our credit ratings and profile. The credit and business risk profiles of our General Partner or indirect owner of our General Partner may be factors in credit evaluations of us as a master limited partnership due to the significant influence of our General Partner and indirect owners over our business activities, including our cash distributions, acquisition strategy and business risk profile. Another factor that may be considered is the financial condition of our General Partner and its owners, including the degree of their financial leverage and their dependence on cash flow from us to service their indebtedness. We may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests without the consent of our Unitholders, which will dilute Unitholders ownership interest in us and may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. Our partnership agreement allows us to issue an unlimited number of additional limited partner interests, including securities senior to the Common Units, without the approval of our Unitholders. The issuance of additional Common Units or other equity securities by us will have the following effects:  our Unitholders current proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;  the amount of cash available for distribution on each Common Unit or partnership security may decrease; 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding Common Unit may be diminished; and  the market price of our Common Units may decline. In addition, ETP may sell an unlimited number of limited partner interests without the consent of its Unitholders, which will dilute existing interests of its Unitholders, including us. The issuance of additional Common Units or other equity securities by ETP will have essentially the same effects as detailed above. The market price of our Common Units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our units in the public markets, including sales by our existing Unitholders. Sales by any of our existing Unitholders of a substantial number of our units in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities. We do not know whether any such sales would be made in the public market or in private placements, nor do we know what impact such potential or actual sales would have on our unit price in the future. Control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without Unitholder consent. Our General Partner may transfer its General Partner interest in us to a third party in a merger or in a sale of its equity securities without the consent of our Unitholders. Furthermore, there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the members of our General Partner to sell or transfer all or part of their ownership interest in our General Partner to a third party. The new owner or owners of our General Partner would then be in a position to replace the directors and officers of our General Partner and control the decisions made and actions taken by the board of directors and officers. Our General Partner has only one executive officer, and we are dependent on third parties, including key personnel of ETP under a shared services agreement, to provide the financial, accounting, administrative and legal services necessary to operate our business. John W. McReynolds, the President and Chief Financial Officer of our General Partner, is the only executive officer charged with managing our business other than through our shared services agreement with ETP. We do not currently have a plan for identifying a successor to Mr. McReynolds in the event that he retires, dies or becomes disabled. If Mr. McReynolds ceases to serve as the President and Chief Financial Officer of our General Partner for any reason, we would be without executive management other than through our shared services agreement with ETP until one or more new executive officers are selected by the board of directors of our General Partner. As a consequence, the loss of Mr. McReynolds services could have a material negative impact on the management of our business. Moreover, we rely on the services of key personnel of ETP, including the ongoing involvement and continued leadership of Kelcy L. Warren, one of the founders of ETPs midstream business, as well as other key members of ETPs management team such as Marshall S. (Mackie) McCrea, III, President and Chief Operating Officer, and William G. Powers, Jr., President of Propane Operations. Mr. Warren has been integral to the success of ETPs midstream and intrastate transportation and storage businesses because of his ability to identify and develop strategic business opportunities. Losing his leadership could make it difficult for ETP to identify internal growth projects and accretive acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on ETPs ability to increase the cash distributions paid on its partnership interests. ETPs executive officers that provide services to us pursuant to a shared services agreement allocate their time between us and ETP. To the extent that these officers face conflicts regarding the allocation of their time, we may not receive the level of attention from them that the management of our business requires. If ETP is unable to provide us with a sufficient number of personnel with the appropriate level of technical accounting and financial expertise, our internal accounting controls could be adversely impacted. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements An increase in interest rates may cause the market price of our units to decline. Like all equity investments, an investment in our units is subject to certain risks. In exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments. Accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments such as publicly traded limited partnership interests. Reduced demand for our units resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our units to decline. Limited partners liability may not be limited, and our Unitholders may have to repay distributions or make additional contributions to us under limited circumstances. As a limited partner in a partnership organized under Delaware law, a limited partner could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if it participates in the control of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. Additionally, the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in many jurisdictions in which we do business. In some of the jurisdictions in which we do business, the applicable statutes do not define control, but do permit limited partners to engage in certain activities, including, among other actions, taking any action with respect to the dissolution of the partnership, the sale, exchange, lease or mortgage of any asset of the partnership, the admission or removal of the general partner and the amendment of the partnership agreement. A limited partner could, however, be liable for any and all of our obligations as if it was a general partner if:  a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular states partnership statute; or  a limited partners right to act with other Unitholders to take other actions under our partnership agreement is found to constitute control of our business. Under limited circumstances, our Unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, neither Energy Transfer Equity nor ETP may make a distribution to its Unitholders if the distribution would cause Energy Transfer Equitys or ETPs respective liabilities to exceed the fair value of their respective assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, partners who received the distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. If we cease to manage and control ETP in the future, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we cease to manage and control ETP and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission or modify our organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us or our affiliates. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If Energy Transfer Partners GP withdraws or is removed as ETPs General Partner, then we would lose control over the management and affairs of Energy Transfer Partners, the risk that we would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 would be exacerbated and our indirect ownership of the General Partner interests and 100% of the incentive distribution rights in ETP could be cashed out or converted into ETP Common Units at an unattractive valuation. Under the terms of ETPs Partnership Agreement, ETP GP will be deemed to have withdrawn as General Partner if, among other things, it:  voluntarily withdraws from the partnership by giving notice to the other partners;  transfers all, but not less than all, of its partnership interests to another entity in accordance with the terms of ETPs Partnership Agreement;  makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, files a voluntary bankruptcy petition, seeks to liquidate, acquiesces in the appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator, or becomes subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition; or  dissolves itself under Delaware law without reinstatement within the requisite period. In addition, ETP GP can be removed as ETPs General Partner if that removal is approved by Unitholders holding at least 66 2/3% of ETPs outstanding common units (including units held by ETP GP and its affiliates). Currently, ETP GP and its affiliates own approximately 33% of ETPs outstanding common units. If ETP GP withdraws from being ETPs General Partner in compliance with ETPs partnership agreement or is removed from being ETPs General Partner under circumstances not involving a final adjudication of actual fraud, gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct, it may require the successor general partner to purchase its general partner interests, incentive distribution rights and limited partner interests in ETP for fair market value. If ETP GP withdraws from being ETPs General Partner in violation of ETPs partnership agreement or is removed from being ETPs General Partner in circumstances where a court enters a judgment that cannot be appealed finding it liable for actual fraud, gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as ETPs General Partner, and the successor general partner does not exercise its option to purchase the general partner interests, incentive distribution rights and limited partner interests held by ETP GP in ETP for fair market value, then the general partner interests and incentive distribution rights held by ETP GP in ETP could be converted into limited partner interests pursuant to a valuation performed by an investment banking firm or other independent expert. Under any of the foregoing scenarios, ETP GP would lose control over the management and affairs of ETP, thereby increasing the risk that we would be deemed an investment company subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, our indirect ownership of the general partner interests and 100% of the incentive distribution rights in ETP, to which a significant portion of the value of our Common Units is currently attributable, could be cashed out or converted into ETP Common Units at an unattractive valuation. Our Partnership Agreement restricts the rights of Unitholders owning 20% or more of our units. Our Unitholders voting rights are restricted by the provision in our partnership agreement generally providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our General Partner and its affiliates, cannot be voted on any matter. In addition, our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of our Unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our Unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of our management. As a result, the price at which our Common Units will trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Future sales of the ETP Common Units we own or other limited partner interests in the public market could reduce the market price of our Unitholders limited partner interests. As of December 31, 2009, we owned approximately 62.5 million Common Units of ETP. If we were to sell and/or distribute our ETP Common Units to the holders of our equity interests in the future, those holders may dispose of some or all of these units. The sale or disposition of a substantial portion of these units in the public markets could reduce the market price of ETPs outstanding Common Units and our receipt of distributions. Cost reimbursements due to our General Partner may be substantial and may reduce our ability to pay the distributions to our Unitholders. Prior to making any distributions to our Unitholders, we will reimburse our General Partner for all expenses it has incurred on our behalf. In addition, our General Partner and its affiliates may provide us with services for which we will be charged reasonable fees as determined by our General Partner. The reimbursement of these expenses and the payment of these fees could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our Unitholders. Our General Partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses and fees. In addition, under Delaware partnership law, our General Partner has unlimited liability for our obligations, such as our debts and environmental liabilities, except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. To the extent our general partner incurs obligations on our behalf, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify it. If we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify our General Partner, our General Partner may take actions to cause us to make payments of these obligations and liabilities. Any such payments could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our Unitholders and cause the value of our Common Units to decline. An impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings. At December 31, 2009, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $775.0 million of goodwill and $349.7 million of intangible assets. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur, indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets such as intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets were impaired, we would be required to take an immediate charge to earnings with a correlative effect on partners equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest Although we control ETP through our ownership of its General Partner, ETPs General Partner owes fiduciary duties to ETP and ETPs Unitholders, which may conflict with our interests. Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, including ETPs General Partner, on the one hand, and ETP and its Limited Partners, on the other hand. The directors and officers of ETPs General Partner have fiduciary duties to manage ETP in a manner beneficial to us, its owner. At the same time, the General Partner has a fiduciary duty to manage ETP in a manner beneficial to ETP and its limited partners. The board of directors of ETPs General Partner will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our Unitholders. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For example, conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations:  the allocation of shared overhead expenses to ETP and us;  the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and ETP, on the other hand;  the determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to ETPs partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of ETPs business;  the determination whether to make borrowings under ETPs revolving working capital facility to pay distributions to ETPs partners; and  any decision we make in the future to engage in business activities independent of ETP. The fiduciary duties of our General Partners officers and directors may conflict with those of ETPs General Partner. Conflicts of interest may arise because of the relationships between ETPs General Partner, ETP and us. Our General Partners directors and officers have fiduciary duties to manage our business in a manner beneficial to us and our Unitholders. Some of our General Partners directors are also directors and officers of ETPs General Partner, and have fiduciary duties to manage the business of ETP in a manner beneficial to ETP and ETPs Unitholders. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our Unitholders. The risk of competition with affiliates of our General Partner has increased. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner will be restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our General Partner and those activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us. Except as provided in our partnership agreement, affiliates of our General Partner are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. Enterprise GP currently has a 40.6% non-controlling equity interest in our General Partner. Enterprise GP and its subsidiaries own and operate North American midstream energy business that competes with us with respect to our natural gas midstream business. Potential conflicts of interest may arise among our General Partner, its affiliates and us. Our General Partner and its affiliates have limited fiduciary duties to us and our Unitholders, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our Unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise among our General Partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us and our Unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our General Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our Unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following:  Our General Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, including ETP and its affiliates and any general partners and limited partnerships acquired in the future, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duties to us.  Our General Partner has limited its liability and reduced its fiduciary duties under the terms of our Partnership Agreement, while also restricting the remedies available to our Unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. As a result of purchasing our units, Unitholders consent to various actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law.  Our General Partner determines the amount and timing of our investment transactions, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our Unitholders. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Our General Partner determines which costs it and its affiliates have incurred are reimbursable by us.  Our Partnership Agreement does not restrict our General Partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered, or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, so long as the terms of any such payments or additional contractual arrangements are fair and reasonable to us.  Our General Partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates.  Our General Partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us. Our partnership agreement limits our General Partners fiduciary duties to us and our Unitholders and restricts the remedies available to our Unitholders for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our General Partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement:  permits our General Partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our General Partner. This entitles our General Partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any limited partner;  provides that our General Partner is entitled to make other decisions in good faith if it reasonably believes that the decisions are in our best interests;  generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the Audit and Conflicts Committee of the board of directors of our General Partner and not involving a vote of Unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be fair and reasonable to us and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable, our General Partner may consider the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and  provides that our General Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the General Partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. In order to become a limited partner of our partnership, our Unitholders are required to agree to be bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above. Our General Partner has a limited call right that may require Unitholders to sell their units at an undesirable time or price. If at any time our General Partner and its affiliates own more than 90% of our outstanding units, our General Partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. As a result, Unitholders may be required to sell their units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. As of December 31, 2009, the equity owners of our General Partner and their affiliates including Enterprise GP Holdings, L.P. own approximately 49% of our Common Units. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We own an interstate pipeline that is subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and, in the event that 15% or more of our outstanding Common Units, in the aggregate, are held by persons who are not eligible holders, Common Units held by persons who are not eligible holders will be subject to the possibility of redemption at the then-current market price. We own an interstate pipeline that is subject to rate regulation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, (FERC), and as a result our General Partner has the right under our partnership agreement to institute procedures, by giving notice to each of our Unitholders, that would require transferees of Common Units and, upon the request of our General Partner, existing holders of our Common Units to certify that they are Eligible Holders. The purpose of these certification procedures would be to enable us to utilize a federal income tax expense as a component of the pipelines rate base upon which tariffs may be established under FERC rate-making policies applicable to entities that pass-through their taxable income to their owners. Eligible Holders are individuals or entities subject to United States federal income taxation on the income generated by us or entities not subject to United States federal income taxation on the income generated by us, so long as all of the entitys owners are subject to such taxation. If these tax certification procedures are implemented and 15% or more of our outstanding Common Units are held by persons who are not Eligible Holders, we will have the right to redeem the units held by persons who are not Eligible Holders at the then-current market price. The redemption price would be paid in cash or by delivery of a promissory note, as determined by our General Partner. ETP may issue additional common units, which may increase the risk that ETP will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level. The partnership agreement of ETP allows ETP to issue an unlimited number of additional limited partner interests. The issuance of additional common units or other equity securities by ETP will have the following effects:  unitholders current proportionate ownership interest in ETP will decrease;  the amount of cash available for distribution on each common unit or partnership security may decrease;  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unit may be diminished; and  the market price of ETPs common units may decline. The payment of distributions on any additional units issued by ETP may increase the risk that ETP may not have sufficient cash available to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that we have to meet our obligations, including obligations under the notes. Risks Related to Energy Transfer Partners Business Since our cash flows consist exclusively of distributions from ETP, risks to ETPs business are also risks to us. We have set forth below risks to ETPs business, the occurrence of which could have a negative impact on ETPs financial performance and decrease the amount of cash it is able to distribute to us, thereby impacting the amount of cash that we are able to distribute to our Unitholders. ETP is exposed to the credit risk of its customers, and an increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by its customers could reduce its ability to make distributions to its Unitholders, including to us. The risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by ETPs customers are a major concern in its business. Participants in the energy industry have been subjected to heightened scrutiny from the financial markets in light of past collapses and failures of other energy companies. ETP is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers. The current tightening of credit in the financial markets may 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements make it more difficult for customers to obtain financing and, depending on the degree to which this occurs, there may be a material increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by ETPs customers. Any substantial increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by ETPs customers could have a material adverse effect on ETPs results of operations and operating cash flows. ETP is exposed to claims by third parties related to the claims that were previously brought against us and ETP by the FERC. On July 26, 2007, the FERC issued to ETP an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Proposed Penalties (the Order and Notice) that contains allegations that ETP violated FERC rules and regulations. The FERC alleged that ETP engaged in manipulative or improper trading activities in the Houston Ship Channel, primarily on two dates during the fall of 2005 following the occurrence of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as well as on eight other occasions from December 2003 through August 2005, in order to benefit financially from ETPs commodities derivatives positions and from certain of ETPs index-priced physical gas purchases in the Houston Ship Channel. The FERC alleged that during these periods ETP violated the FERCs then-effective Market Behavior Rule 2, an anti-market manipulation rule promulgated by the FERC under authority of the Natural Gas Act (NGA). The FERC alleges that ETP violated this rule by artificially suppressing prices that were included in the Platts Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index, published by McGraw-Hill Companies, on which the pricing of many physical natural gas contracts and financial derivatives are based. In its Order and Notice, the FERC also alleged that ETP manipulated daily prices at the Waha and Permian Hubs in west Texas on two dates. The FERC also alleged that one of ETPs intrastate pipelines violated various FERC regulations by, among other things, granting undue preferences in favor of an affiliate. In its Order and Notice, the FERC specified that it was seeking $69.9 million in disgorgement of profits, plus interest, and $82.0 million in civil penalties relating to these market manipulation claims. The FERC specified that it was also seeking to revoke, for a period of 12 months, ETPs blanket marketing authority for sales of natural gas in interstate commerce at market-based prices. In February 2008, the FERCs Enforcement Staff also recommended that the FERC pursue market manipulation claims related to ETPs trading activities in October 2005 for November 2005 monthly deliveries, a period not previously covered by the FERCs allegations in the Order and Notice, and that ETP be assessed an additional civil penalty of $25.0 million and be required to disgorge approximately $7.3 million of alleged unjust profits related to this additional month. On August 26, 2009, ETP entered into a settlement agreement with the FERCs Enforcement Staff with respect to the pending FERC claims against ETP and on September 21, 2009, the FERC approved the settlement agreement without modification. The agreement settles all outstanding FERC claims against ETP and provides that ETP make a $5.0 million payment to the federal government and establish a $25.0 million fund for the purpose of settling related third-party claims against ETP, including existing litigation claims as well as any new claims that may be asserted against this fund. An administrative law judge appointed by the FERC will determine the validity of any third party claim against this fund. Any party who receives money from this fund will be required to waive all claims against ETP related to this matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the FERC will make no findings of fact or conclusions of law. In addition, the settlement agreement specifies that by exceeding the settlement agreement, ETP does not admit or concede to the FERC or any third party any actual or potential fault, wrongdoing or liability in connection with ETPs alleged conduct related to the FERC claims. The settlement agreement also requires ETP to maintain specified compliance programs and to conduct independent annual audits of such programs for a two-year period. We made the $5.0 million payment and established the $25.0 million fund in October 2009. The allocation of the $25.0 million fund is expected to be determined in 2010. In addition to the FERC legal action, third parties have asserted claims and may assert additional claims against us and ETP alleging damages related to these matters. In this regard, several natural gas producers and a natural 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements gas marketing company have initiated legal proceedings in Texas state courts against us and ETP for claims related to the FERC claims. These suits contain contract and tort claims relating to alleged manipulation of natural gas prices at the Houston Ship Channel and the Waha Hub in West Texas, as well as the natural gas price indices related to these markets and the Permian Basin natural gas price index during the period from December 2003 through December 2006, and seek unspecified direct, indirect, consequential and exemplary damages. One of the suits against us and ETP contains an additional allegation that we and ETP transported gas in a manner that favored our affiliates and discriminated against the plaintiff, and otherwise artificially affected the market price of gas to other parties in the market. We have moved to compel arbitration and/or contested subject-matter jurisdiction in some of these cases. In one of these cases, the Texas Supreme Court ruled on July 3, 2009 that the state district court erred in ruling that a plaintiff was entitled to pre-arbitration discovery and therefore remanded to the state district court with a direction to rule on our original motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the arbitration clause in a natural gas contract between us and the plaintiff. This plaintiff has filed a motion with the Texas Supreme Court requesting a rehearing of the ruling. In February 2008, we were served with a complaint from an owner of royalty interests in natural gas producing properties, individually and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated royalty owners, working interest owners and producer/operators, seeking arbitration to recover damages based on alleged manipulation of natural gas prices at the Houston Ship Channel. ETP filed an original action in Harris County state court seeking a stay of the arbitration on the ground that the action is not arbitrable, and the state court granted our motion for summary judgment on that issue. This action is currently on appeal before the First Court of Appeals, Houston, Texas. In October 2007, a consolidated class action complaint was filed against ETP in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. This action alleges that ETP engaged in intentional and unlawful manipulation of the price of natural gas futures and options contracts on the NYMEX in violation of the CEA. It is further alleged that during the class period from December 29, 2003 to December 31, 2005, ETP had the market power to manipulate index prices, and that ETP used this market power to artificially depress the index prices at major natural gas trading hubs, including the Houston Ship Channel, in order to benefit ETPs natural gas physical and financial trading positions, and that ETP intentionally submitted price and volume trade information to trade publications. This complaint also alleges that ETP violated the CEA by knowingly aiding and abetting violations of the CEA. The plaintiffs state that this allegedly unlawful depression of index prices by ETP manipulated the NYMEX prices for natural gas futures and options contracts to artificial levels during the class period, causing unspecified damages to the plaintiffs and all other members of the putative class who sold natural gas futures or who purchased and/or sold natural gas options contracts on NYMEX during the class period. The plaintiffs have requested certification of their suit as a class action and seek unspecified damages, court costs and other appropriate relief. On January 14, 2008, ETP filed a motion to dismiss this suit on the grounds of failure to allege facts sufficient to state a claim. On March 20, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a second consolidated class action complaint. In response to this new pleading, on May 5, 2008, ETP filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 26, 2009, the court issued an order dismissing the complaint, with prejudice, for failure to state a claim. On April 9, 2009, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the order dismissing the complaint, and on August 26, 2009, the court denied the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. On September 28, 2009, these decisions were appealed by the plaintiffs to the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, and the appeal is currently in briefing stage before the court. In March 2008, a second class action complaint was filed against ETP in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. This action alleges that ETP engaged in unlawful restraint of trade and intentional monopolization and attempted monopolization of the market for fixed-price natural gas baseload transactions at the Houston Ship Channel from December 2003 through December 2005 in violation of federal antitrust law. The complaint further alleges that during this period ETP exerted monopoly power to suppress the price for these transactions to non-competitive levels in order to benefit ETPs own physical natural gas positions. The plaintiff has, individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated sellers of physical natural gas, requested certification of its suit as a class action and seeks unspecified treble damages, court costs and other appropriate 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements relief. On May 19, 2008, ETP filed a motion to dismiss this complaint. On March 26, 2009, the court issued an order dismissing the complaint. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on all causes of action and for antitrust injury, but granted leave to amend. On April 23, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend to assert a claim for common law fraud and attached a proposed amended complaint as an exhibit. ETP opposed the motion and cross-moved to dismiss. On August 7, 2009, the court denied the plaintiffs motion and granted ETPs motion to dismiss the complaint. On September 10, 2009, this decision was appealed by the plaintiff to the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, and the appeal is currently in briefing stage before the court. ETP is expensing the legal fees, consultants fees and other expenses relating to these matters in the periods in which such costs are incurred. We do not have any accruals for litigation and other contingencies as of December 31, 2009. Although the $25.0 million fund required by the settlement agreement with the FERC is to be applied to resolve third party claims, including the existing third party litigation described above, it is possible that the amount ETP becomes obliged to pay to resolve third party litigation related to these matters, whether on a negotiated settlement basis or otherwise, will exceed the amount of the fund. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, ETP will review the amount of their accrual related to these matters as developments related to these matters occur and ETP will adjust their accrual if ETP determines that it is probable that the amount ETP may ultimately become obliged to pay as a result of the final resolution of these matters is greater than the amount of ETPs accrual for these matters. As ETPs accrual amounts are non-cash, any cash payment of an amount in resolution of these matters would likely be made from cash from operations or borrowings, which payments would reduce ETPs cash available to service ETPs indebtedness either directly or as a result of increased principal and interest payments necessary to service any borrowings incurred to finance such payments. If these payments are substantial, ETP may experience a material adverse impact on its results of operations and its liquidity. The profitability of certain activities in ETPs midstream and intrastate transportation and storage operations are largely dependent upon natural gas commodity prices, price spreads between two or more physical locations and market demand for natural gas and NGLs, which are factors beyond ETPs control and have been volatile. Income from ETPs midstream and intrastate transportation and storage operations is exposed to risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices. For a portion of the natural gas gathered at the North Texas System, Southeast Texas System and at ETPs HPL System, ETP purchases natural gas from producers at the wellhead and then gathers and delivers the natural gas to pipelines where ETP typically resells the natural gas under various arrangements, including sales at index prices. Generally, the gross margins ETP realizes under these arrangements decrease in periods of low natural gas prices. For a portion of the natural gas gathered and processed at the North Texas System and Southeast Texas System, ETP enters into percentage-of-proceeds arrangements, keep-whole arrangements, and processing fee agreements pursuant to which ETP agrees to gather and process natural gas received from the producers. Under percentage-of-proceeds arrangements, ETP generally sells the residue gas and NGLs at market prices and remits to the producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price. In other cases, instead of remitting cash payments to the producer, ETP delivers an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and NGL volumes to the producer and sells the volumes it keeps to third parties at market prices. Under these arrangements, ETPs revenues and gross margins decline when natural gas prices and NGL prices decrease. Accordingly, a decrease in the price of natural gas or NGLs could have an adverse effect on ETPs results of operations. Under keep-whole arrangements, ETP generally sells the NGLs produced from its gathering and processing operations to third parties at market prices. Because the extraction of the NGLs from the natural gas during processing reduces the Btu content of the natural gas, ETP must either purchase natural gas at market prices for return to producers or make a cash payment to producers equal to the value of this natural gas. Under these arrangements, ETPs revenues and gross margins decrease when the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of NGLs if ETP is not able to bypass its processing plants and sell the unprocessed natural gas. Under 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements processing fee agreements, we process the gas for a fee. If recoveries are less than those guaranteed the producer, ETP may suffer a loss by having to supply liquids or its cash equivalent to keep the producer whole with regard to contractual recoveries. In the past, the prices of natural gas and NGLs have been extremely volatile, and ETP expects this volatility to continue. For example, during ETPs year ended December 31, 2009, the NYMEX settlement price for the prompt month contract ranged from a high of $6.14 per MMBtu to a low of $2.84 per MMBtu. A composite of the Mt. Belvieu average NGLs price based upon ETPs average NGLs composition during ETPs year ended December 31, 2009 ranged from a high of approximately $1.17 per gallon to a low of approximately $0.57 per gallon. ETPs Oasis pipeline, East Texas pipeline, ET Fuel System and HPL System receive fees for transporting natural gas for its customers. Although a significant amount of the pipeline capacity of the East Texas pipeline and various pipeline segments of the ET Fuel System is committed under long-term fee-based contracts, the remaining capacity of ETPs transportation pipelines is subject to fluctuation in demand based on the markets and prices for natural gas, which factors may result in decisions by natural gas producers to reduce production of natural gas during periods of lower prices for natural gas or may result in decisions by end-users of natural gas to reduce consumption of these fuels during periods of higher prices for these fuels. ETPs fuel retention fees are also directly impacted by changes in natural gas prices. Increases in natural gas prices tend to increase ETPs fuel retention fees, and decreases in natural gas prices tend to decrease its fuel retention fees. The markets and prices for natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond ETPs control. These factors include demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:  the impact of weather on the demand for oil and natural gas;  the level of domestic oil and natural gas production;  the availability of imported oil and natural gas;  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;  the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems;  the price, availability and marketing of competitive fuels;  the demand for electricity;  the impact of energy conservation efforts; and  the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. The use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses by ETP. From time to time, ETP has sought to limit a portion of the adverse effects resulting from changes in natural gas and other commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other risk management mechanisms and by ETPs marketing and/or system optimization activities. To the extent that ETP hedges its commodity price and interest rate exposures, it foregoes the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in ETPs favor. In addition, even though monitored by management, ETPs derivatives activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the derivative arrangement, the hedge is imperfect, commodity prices move unfavorably related to ETPs physical or financial positions or hedging policies and procedures are not followed. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ETPs success depends upon its ability to continually contract for new sources of natural gas supply. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on ETPs gathering and transportation pipeline systems and asset utilization rates at its treating and processing plants, ETP must continually contract for new natural gas supplies and natural gas transportation services. ETP may not be able to obtain additional contracts for natural gas supplies for its natural gas gathering systems, and it may be unable to maintain or increase the levels of natural gas throughput on its transportation pipelines. The primary factors affecting ETPs ability to connect new supplies of natural gas to its gathering systems include its success in contracting for existing natural gas supplies that are not committed to other systems and the level of drilling activity and production of natural gas near ETPs gathering systems or in areas that provide access to its transportation pipelines or markets to which its systems connect. The primary factors affecting ETPs ability to attract customers to its transportation pipelines consist of its access to other natural gas pipelines, natural gas markets, natural gas-fired power plants and other industrial end-users and the level of drilling and production of natural gas in areas connected to these pipelines and systems. Fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling activity and production generally decrease as oil and natural gas prices decrease. ETP has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves underlying the wells and the rate at which production from a well will decline, sometimes referred to as the decline rate. In addition, ETP has no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for hydrocarbons, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital. A substantial portion of ETPs assets, including its gathering systems and its processing and treating plants, are connected to natural gas reserves and wells for which the production will naturally decline over time. Accordingly, ETPs cash flows will also decline unless it is able to access new supplies of natural gas by connecting additional production to these systems. ETPs transportation pipelines are also dependent upon natural gas production in areas served by its pipelines or in areas served by other gathering systems or transportation pipelines that connect with its transportation pipelines. A material decrease in natural gas production in ETPs areas of operation or in other areas that are connected to ETPs areas of operation by third party gathering systems or pipelines, as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise, would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas ETP handles, which would reduce ETPs revenues and operating income. In addition, ETPs future growth will depend, in part, upon whether it can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the natural decline rate in ETPs currently connected supplies. Transwestern derives a significant portion of its revenue from charging its customers for reservation of capacity, which revenues Transwestern receives regardless of whether these customers actually use the reserved capacity. Transwestern also generates revenue from transportation of natural gas for customers without reserved capacity. If the reserves available through the supply basins connected to Transwesterns systems decline, a decrease in development or production activity could cause a decrease in the volume of natural gas available for transmission or a decrease in demand for natural gas transportation on the Transwestern system over the long run. The volumes of natural gas ETP transports on its intrastate transportation pipelines may be reduced in the event that the prices at which natural gas is purchased and sold at the Waha Hub, the Katy Hub, the Carthage Hub and the Houston Ship Channel Hub, the four major natural gas trading hubs served by ETPs pipelines, become unfavorable in relation to prices for natural gas at other natural gas trading hubs or in other markets as customers may elect to transport their natural gas to these other hubs or markets using pipelines other than those ETP operates. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ETP may not be able to fully execute its growth strategy if it encounters increased competition for qualified assets. ETPs strategy contemplates growth through the development and acquisition of a wide range of midstream, transportation, storage, propane and other energy infrastructure assets while maintaining a strong balance sheet. This strategy includes constructing and acquiring additional assets and businesses to enhance its ability to compete effectively and diversify its asset portfolio, thereby providing more stable cash flow. ETP regularly considers and enters into discussions regarding, and are currently contemplating, the acquisition of additional assets and businesses, stand alone development projects or other transactions that ETP believes will present opportunities to realize synergies and increase its cash flow. Consistent with ETPs acquisition strategy, management is continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible acquisition of additional assets or businesses. Such acquisition efforts may involve ETP managements participation in processes that involve a number of potential buyers, commonly referred to as auction processes, as well as situations in which ETP believes it is the only party or one of a very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller. We cannot guarantee that ETPs current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms considered favorable to ETP. In addition, ETP is experiencing increased competition for the assets it purchases or contemplates purchasing. Increased competition for a limited pool of assets could result in ETP losing to other bidders more often or acquiring assets at higher prices, both of which would limit ETPs ability to fully execute its growth strategy. Inability to execute its growth strategy may materially adversely impact ETPs results of operations. If ETP does not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, its future growth could be limited. ETPs results of operations and its ability to grow and to increase distributions to Unitholders will depend in part on its ability to make acquisitions that are accretive to ETPs distributable cash flow per unit. ETP may be unable to make accretive acquisitions for any of the following reasons, among others:  because ETP is unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them;  because ETP is unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or  because ETP is outbid by competitors, some of which are substantially larger than ETP and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital then it does. Furthermore, even if ETP consummates acquisitions that it believes will be accretive, those acquisitions may in fact adversely affect its results of operations or result in a decrease in distributable cash flow per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including the risk that ETP may:  fail to realize anticipated benefits, such as new customer relationships, cost-savings or cash flow enhancements;  decrease its liquidity by using a significant portion of its available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;  significantly increase its interest expense or financial leverage if ETP incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions;  encounter difficulties operating in new geographic areas or new lines of business;  incur or assume unanticipated liabilities, losses or costs associated with the business or assets acquired for which ETP is not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate; 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  be unable to hire, train or retrain qualified personnel to manage and operate its growing business and assets;  less effectively manage its historical assets, due to the diversion of ETP managements attention from other business concerns; or  incur other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges. If ETP consummates future acquisitions, its capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. As ETP determines the application of its funds and other resources, Unitholders will not have an opportunity to evaluate the economics, financial and other relevant information that ETP will consider. If ETP does not continue to construct new pipelines, its future growth could be limited. During the past several years, ETP has constructed several new pipelines, and ETP is currently involved in constructing several new pipelines. ETPs results of operations and its ability to grow and to increase distributable cash flow per unit will depend, in part, on its ability to construct pipelines that are accretive to ETPs distributable cash flow. ETP may be unable to construct pipelines that are accretive to distributable cash flow for any of the following reasons, among others:  ETP is unable to identify pipeline construction opportunities with favorable projected financial returns;  ETP is unable to raise financing for its identified pipeline construction opportunities; or  ETP is unable to secure sufficient natural gas transportation commitments from potential customers due to competition from other pipeline construction projects or for other reasons. Furthermore, even if ETP constructs a pipeline that it believes will be accretive, the pipeline may in fact adversely affect its results of operations or results from those projected prior to commencement of construction and other factors. Expanding ETPs business by constructing new pipelines and treating and processing facilities subjects it to risks. One of the ways that ETP has grown its business is through the construction of additions to its existing gathering, compression, treating, processing and transportation systems. The construction of a new pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline, by adding additional compression capabilities or by adding a second pipeline along an existing pipeline, and the construction of new processing or treating facilities, involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond ETPs control and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital that ETP will be required to finance through borrowings, the issuance of additional equity or from operating cash flow. If ETP undertakes these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at all or at the budgeted cost. ETP currently has several major expansion and new build projects planned or underway, including the Fayetteville Express pipeline and the Tiger pipeline. A variety of factors outside ETPs control, such as weather, natural disasters and difficulties in obtaining permits and rights-of-way or other regulatory approvals, as well as the performance by third party contractors has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs or delays in construction. Cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on ETPs results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, ETPs revenues may not increase immediately following the completion of a particular project. For instance, if ETP builds a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time, but ETP may not materially increase its revenues until long after the projects completion. In addition, the success of a pipeline construction project will likely depend upon the level of natural gas exploration and development drilling activity and the demand for pipeline transportation in the areas proposed to be serviced by the project as well as ETPs ability to obtain commitments from producers in this area to utilize the newly constructed pipelines. In this regard, ETP may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production in a region in which such growth does not 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements materialize. As a result, new facilities may be unable to attract enough throughput or contracted capacity reservation commitments to achieve ETPs expected investment return, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. ETP depends on certain key producers for its supply of natural gas on the Southeast Texas System and North Texas System and the loss of any of these key producers could adversely affect its financial results. For ETPs year ended December 31, 2009, EnCana Oil and Gas (USA), Inc., XTO Energy Inc. (XTO), SandRidge Energy Inc. and EnerVest Operating, LLC, supplied ETP with approximately 70% of the Southeast Texas Systems natural gas supply. In December 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) and XTO announced an agreement whereby ExxonMobil will acquire XTO. For ETPs year ended December 31, 2009, Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., XTO, EOG Resources, Inc., and EnCana Oil and Gas (USA), Inc., supplied ETP with approximately 84% of the North Texas Systems natural gas supply. ETP is not the only option available to these producers for disposition of the natural gas they produce. To the extent that these and other producers may reduce the volumes of natural gas that they supply ETP, ETP would be adversely affected unless it was able to acquire comparable supplies of natural gas from other producers. ETP depends on key customers to transport natural gas through its pipelines. ETP has nine- and ten-year fee-based transportation contracts with XTO that terminate in 2013 and 2017, respectively, pursuant to which XTO has committed to transport certain minimum volumes of natural gas on pipelines in our ET Fuel System. ExxonMobils pending acquisition of XTO, expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2010, is not expected to result in any changes to these commitments. ETP also has an eight-year fee-based transportation contract with TXU Portfolio Management Company, L.P., a subsidiary of TXU Corp. (TXU Shipper) to transport natural gas on the ET Fuel System to TXUs electric generating power plants. ETP has also entered into two eight-year natural gas storage contracts that terminate in 2012 with TXU Shipper to store natural gas at the two natural gas storage facilities that are part of the ET Fuel System. Each of the contracts with TXU Shipper may be extended by TXU Shipper for two additional five-year terms. The failure of XTO Energy or TXU Shipper to fulfill their contractual obligations under these contracts could have a material adverse effect on ETPs cash flow and results of operations if ETP was not able to replace these customers under arrangements that provide similar economic benefits as these existing contracts. The major shippers on ETPs intrastate transportation pipelines include XTO, EOG Resources, Inc., Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., EnCana Marketing (USA), Inc. and Quicksilver Resources, Inc. These shippers have long-term contracts that have remaining terms ranging from 2 to 11 years. Transwestern generates the majority of its revenues from long-term and short-term firm transportation contracts with natural gas producers, local distribution companies and end-users. During 2009, ConocoPhillips, Salt River Project and BP Energy Company collectively accounted for 32% of Transwesterns total revenues. The failure of the major shippers on our intrastate and interstate transportation pipelines to fulfill their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on ETPs and our cash flow and results of operations if ETP was not able to replace these customers under arrangements that provide similar economic benefits as these existing contracts. With respect to ETPs interstate transportation operations, MEP, the joint venture entity formed to construct and operate the Midcontinent Express pipeline, has secured predominantly 10-year firm transportation contracts from a small number of major shippers for all of the current 1.4 Bcf/d of capacity on the Midcontinent Express pipeline. MEP has also secured firm transportation commitments related to additional capacity on the Midcontinent Express pipeline, which expansion was approved by the FERC in September 2009. The planned capacity expansions to 1.8 Bcf/d are expected to be completed in the latter part of 2010. FEP has secured binding 10-year commitments from a small number of major shippers for approximately 1.85 Bcf/d of firm transportation 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements service on the 2.0 Bcf/d Fayetteville Express pipeline project. In connection with our Tiger pipeline project, ETP has entered into an agreement with Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. that provides for a 15-year commitment for firm transportation capacity of approximately 1.0 Bcf/d. ETP has also entered into agreements with EnCana Marketing (USA), Inc. and other shippers that provide for 10-year commitments for firm transportation capacity on the Tiger pipeline, bringing the initial design capacity to 2.0 Bcf/d in the aggregate. In February 2010, we announced that we had entered into a 10-year commitment for an additional 400 MMcf/d. The failure of these key shippers to fulfill their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on ETPs cash flow and results of operations if ETP was not able to replace these customers under arrangements that provide similar economic benefits as these existing contracts. Federal, state or local regulatory measures could adversely affect the business and operations of ETPs midstream and intrastate assets. ETPs midstream and intrastate transportation and storage operations are generally exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, but FERC regulation still significantly affects its business and the market for its products. The rates, terms and conditions of some of the transportation and storage services ETP provides on the HPL System, the East Texas pipeline, the Oasis pipeline and the ET Fuel System are subject to FERC regulation under Section 311 of the NGPA. Under Section 311, rates charged for transportation and storage must be fair and equitable amounts. Amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest, and the terms and conditions of service, set forth in the pipelines statement of operating conditions, are subject to FERC review and approval. Should the FERC determine not to authorize rates equal to or greater than its currently approved rates, ETP may suffer a loss of revenue. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to storage and transportation service under Section 311, and failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service, and failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipelines FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in an alteration of jurisdictional status and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. FERC has adopted new market-monitoring and annual and quarterly reporting regulations, which regulations are applicable to many intrastate pipelines as well as other entities that are otherwise not subject to FERCs NGA jurisdiction, such as natural gas marketers. These regulations are intended to increase the transparency of wholesale energy markets, to protect the integrity of such markets, and to improve FERCs ability to assess market forces and detect market manipulation. These regulations may result in administrative burdens and additional compliance costs for ETP. ETP holds transportation contracts with interstate pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation. As a shipper on an interstate pipeline, ETP is subject to FERC requirements related to use of the interstate capacity. Any failure on ETPs part to comply with the FERCs regulations or orders could result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. ETPs intrastate transportation and storage operations are subject to state regulation in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Louisiana, Utah and Colorado, the states in which ETP operates these types of natural gas facilities. ETPs intrastate transportation operations located in Texas are subject to regulation as common purchasers and as gas utilities by the TRRC. The TRRCs jurisdiction extends to both rates and pipeline safety. The rates ETP charges for transportation and storage services are deemed just and reasonable under Texas law unless challenged in a complaint. Should a complaint be filed or should regulation become more active, ETPs business may be adversely affected. ETPs midstream and intrastate transportation operations are also subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Louisiana, Utah and Colorado. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting ETPs right as an 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom ETP contracts to purchase or transport natural gas. Federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states, and some of the states in which ETP operates have adopted complaint-based or other limited economic regulation of natural gas gathering activities. States in which ETP operates that have adopted some form of complaint-based regulation, like Texas, generally allow natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering rates and access. Other state and local regulations also affect ETPs business. ETPs storage facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the TRRC. Generally, the TRRC has jurisdiction over all underground storage of natural gas in Texas, unless the facility is part of an interstate gas pipeline facility. Because the natural gas storage facilities of the ET Fuel System and HPL System are only connected to intrastate gas pipelines, they fall within the TRRCs jurisdiction and must be operated pursuant to TRRC permit. Certain changes in ownership or operation of TRRC-jurisdictional storage facilities, such as facility expansions and increases in the maximum operating pressure, must be approved by the TRRC through an amendment to the facilitys existing permit. In addition, the TRRC must approve transfers of the permits. Texas laws and regulations also require all natural gas storage facilities to be operated to prevent waste, the uncontrolled escape of gas, pollution and danger to life or property. Accordingly, the TRRC requires natural gas storage facilities to implement certain safety, monitoring, reporting and record-keeping measures. Violations of the terms and provisions of a TRRC permit or a TRRC order or regulation can result in the modification, cancellation or suspension of an operating permit and/or civil penalties, injunctive relief, or both. The states in which ETP conducts operations administer federal pipeline safety standards under the Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, which requires certain pipeline companies to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines, and subjects pipelines to regular inspections. Some of ETPs gathering facilities are exempt from the requirements of this Act. In respect to recent pipeline accidents in other parts of the country, Congress and the Department of Transportation have passed or are considering heightened pipeline safety requirements. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. ETPs interstate pipelines are subject to laws, regulations and policies governing the rates they are allowed to charge for their services. Laws, regulations and policies governing interstate natural gas pipeline rates could affect the ability of ETPs interstate pipelines to establish rates, to charge rates that would cover future increases in its costs, or to continue to collect rates that cover current costs. NGA-jurisdictional natural gas companies must charge rates that are deemed just and reasonable by the FERC. The rates charged by natural gas companies are generally required to be on file with the FERC in FERC-approved tariffs. Pursuant to the NGA, existing tariff rates may be challenged by complaint and rate increases proposed by the natural gas company may be challenged by protest. ETP also may be limited by the terms of negotiated rate agreements from seeking future rate increases, or constrained by competitive factors from charging its FERC-approved maximum just and reasonable tariff rates. Further, rates must, for the most part, be cost-based and the FERC has the ability, on a prospective basis, to order refunds of amounts collected under rates that have been found by the FERC to be in excess of a just and reasonable level. Transwestern made a general rate case filing under Section 4 of the NGA in September 2006. The rates in this proceeding were settled and are final and no longer subject to refund. Transwestern is not required to file a new general rate case until October 2011. However, shippers (other than shippers that have agreed, as parties to the Stipulation and Agreement, not to challenge Transwesterns tariff rates through the remaining term of the settlement) have the statutory ability to challenge the lawfulness of tariff rates that have become final and effective. The FERC may also investigate such rates absent shipper complaint. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Most of the rates to be paid by the initial shippers on the Midcontinent Express pipeline are established pursuant to long-term, negotiated rate transportation agreements. Other prospective shippers on Midcontinent Express pipeline that elect not to pay a negotiated rate for service may opt instead to pay a cost-based recourse rate established by the FERC as part of Midcontinent Express pipelines certificate of public convenience and necessity. Negotiated rate agreements generally provide a degree of certainty to the pipeline and shipper as to a fixed rate during the term of the relevant transportation agreement, but such agreements can limit the pipelines future ability to collect costs associated with construction and operation of the pipeline that might be higher than anticipated at the time the negotiated rate agreement was entered. FERC applications for authorization to construct, own and operate the Fayetteville Express pipeline and the Tiger pipeline were filed on June 15, 2009 and August 31, 2009, respectively. On December 17, 2009, the FERC issued an order granting authorization to construct, own and operated the Fayetteville Express pipeline, subject to certain conditions. While FEP has accepted the FERCs certificate authorization, this order is subject to a limited request for rehearing and possible judicial review. FERC has not yet determined whether the Tiger pipeline should be granted the requested authority. ETP cannot predict if, or when and with what conditions, FERC authorization for the Tiger pipeline will be granted. Any successful challenge to the rates of ETPs interstate natural gas companies, whether brought by complaint, protest or investigation, could reduce its revenues associated with providing transportation services on a prospective basis. We and ETP cannot guarantee that ETPs interstate pipelines will be able to recover all of their costs through existing or future rates. The ability of interstate pipelines held in tax-pass-through entities, like ETP, to include an allowance for income taxes in their regulated rates has been subject to extensive litigation before the FERC and the courts, and the FERCs current policy is subject to future refinement or change. The ability of interstate pipelines held in tax-pass-through entities, like ETP, to include an allowance for income taxes as a cost-of-service element in their regulated rates has been subject to extensive litigation before the FERC and the courts for a number of years. It is currently the FERCs policy to permit pipelines to include in cost-of-service a tax allowance to reflect actual or potential income tax liability on their public utility income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests, if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. Whether a pipelines owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. Under the FERCs policy, ETP thus remains eligible to include an income tax allowance in the tariff rates its charges for interstate natural gas transportation. The application of that policy remains subject to future refinement or change by the FERC. With regard to rates charged and collected by Transwestern, the allowance for income taxes as a cost-of-service element in ETPs tariff rates is generally not subject to challenge prior to the expiration of its settlement agreement in 2011. The interstate pipelines are subject to laws, regulations and policies governing terms and conditions of service, which could adversely affect their business and operations. In addition to rate oversight, the FERCs regulatory authority extends to many other aspects of the business and operations of ETPs interstate pipelines, including:  terms and conditions of service;  the types of services interstate pipelines may offer their customers;  construction of new facilities;  acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;  reporting and information posting requirements;  accounts and records; and  relationships with affiliated companies involved in all aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Compliance with these requirements can be costly and burdensome. Future changes to laws, regulations and policies in these areas may impair the ability of ETPs interstate pipelines to compete for business, may impair their ability to recover costs or may increase the cost and burden of operation. We must on occasion rely upon rulings by FERC or other governmental authorities to carry out certain of our business plans. For example, in order to carry out our plan to construct the Fayetteville Express and Tiger pipelines we had have to, among other things, file and support before FERC NGA Section 7(c) applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity to build, own and operate such facilities. Although the FERC has authorized the construction and operation of the Fayetteville Express pipeline, subject to certain conditions, this order is still subject to limited rehearing and possible judicial review. The FERC has not yet ruled upon the Tiger pipeline application and we and ETP cannot guarantee that the FERC will authorize construction and operation of that pipeline or any future interstate natural gas transportation project we might propose. Moreover, there is no guarantee that, if granted, certificate authority for the Tiger pipeline, or any future interstate projects, will be granted in a timely manner or will be free from potentially burdensome conditions. Similarly, ETP was required to obtain from FERC a certificate of public convenience and necessity to build, own and operate the Midcontinent Express pipeline. Although the FERC has granted us such certificate authority, the FERCs certificate order is currently pending judicial review before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. We cannot guarantee that the court will affirm, in all material respects, the FERCs July 25, 2008 Midcontinent Express certificate order, or that the FERC will not materially alter the certificate order on any remand that might be ordered by the court. There are also pending requests for rehearing related to certain of the FERCs post-certification orders related to the MEP project. We cannot guarantee that these post-certification orders will not be altered on rehearing or that these orders will not be subject to judicial review. Failure to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, could bring substantial penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1.0 million per day for each violation. The FERC possesses similar authority under the NGPA. Finally, we and ETP cannot give any assurance regarding the likely future regulations under which ETP will operate its interstate pipelines or the effect such regulation could have on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. ETPs business involves hazardous substances and may be adversely affected by environmental regulation. ETPs natural gas as well as its propane operations are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits for our operations, result in capital expenditures to manage, limit, or prevent emissions, discharges or releases of various materials from ETPs pipelines, plants and facilities and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from ETPs operations. Several governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them and frequently mandate difficult and costly remediation measures and other actions. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctive relief. ETP may incur substantial environmental costs and liabilities because of the underlying risk inherent to its operations. Environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for cleanup costs incurred to address discharges or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes on, under or from ETPs properties and facilities, many of which have been used for industrial activities for a number of years, even if such discharges were caused by its predecessors. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which ETPs gathering systems pass or facilities where its petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, personal injury or property damage. The total accrued future estimated cost of remediation activities relating to ETPs Transwestern pipeline operations expected to continue through 2018 is $8.6 million. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, emission standards, or storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. For example, the EPA in 2008 lowered the federal ozone standard from 0.08 parts per million to 0.075 parts per million, requiring the environmental agencies in states with areas that do not currently meet this standard to adopt new rules between to further reduce NOx and other ozone precursor emissions. The EPA recently proposed to lower the standard even further, to somewhere between 0.060 and 0.070 ppm. We have previously been able to satisfy the more stringent NOx emission reduction requirements that affect our compressor units in ozone non-attainment areas at reasonable cost, but there is no guarantee that the changes we may have to make in the future to meet the new ozone standard or other evolving standards will not require us to incur costs that could be material to our operations. In response to scientific studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to the warming of the Earths atmosphere, there are a number of parallel initiatives to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases. On June 26, 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, or ACESA, which would establish an economy-wide cap and trade program to reduce domestic emissions of greenhouse gases. ACESA would require a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2020 and just over an 80 percent reduction of such emissions by 2050. Under this legislation, EPA would issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or suppliers of carbon-based fuels so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere or market such fuels. The market price of these allowances would be expected to increase significantly over time, thereby encouraging the use of alternative energy sources or greenhouse gas emission control technologies by imposing ever-increasing costs on the use of carbon-based fuels, including NGLs, natural gas, refined petroleum products, and oil. The United States Senate has begun work on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions and President Obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system. At the state level, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. These programs operate similarly to the program contemplated by ACESA. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender emission allowances, either for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., compressor stations) or from the combustion of fuels (e.g., natural gas or NGLs) that we process. Also, as a result of the United States Supreme Courts decision on April 2, 2007 in Massachusetts, et al.v. EPA, EPA was required to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions posed an endangerment to human health and the environment and whether emissions from mobile sources, such as cars and trucks contributed to that endangerment. On December 7, 2009, the EPA announced its findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earths atmosphere causing other climatic changes and that mobile sources are contributing to such endangerment. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In late September 2009, EPA proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its endangerment finding: one to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other to control emissions of greenhouse gases from stationary sources. Although the motor vehicle rules are expected to be adopted in March 2010, it may take EPA several years to impose regulations limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from stationary sources. In addition, on September 22, 2009, the EPA 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements issued a final rule requiring the annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including NGL fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies. Any federal greenhouse gas legislation is expected to prevent EPA from regulating greenhouse gases under existing Clean Air Act regulatory programs to some extent, but if Congress fails to pass greenhouse gas legislation, the EPA is expected to continue its announced greenhouse gas regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act. Any limitation on emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations or the requirement that we obtain allowances for such emissions, as well as the NGLs that we produce, could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations or acquire allowances at the prevailing rates in the marketplace. Some have suggested that one consequence of climate change could be increased severity of extreme weather, such as increased hurricanes and floods. If such effects were to occur, our operations could be adversely affected in various ways, including damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters, or increased costs for insurance. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. The market for our propane and natural gas is generally improved by periods of colder weather and impaired by periods of warmer weather, so any changes in climate could affect the market the fuels that we produce. Despite the use of the term global warming as a shorthand for climate change, some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience substantially colder temperatures than their historical averages. As a result, it is difficult to predict how the market for our fuels would be affected by increased temperature volatility, although if there is an overall trend of warmer temperatures, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business. Any reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, ETPs shippers in interconnecting third-party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes transported in ETPs pipelines, which would adversely affect ETPs revenues and cash flow. Users of ETPs pipelines are dependent upon connections to and from third-party pipelines to receive and deliver natural gas and NGLs. Any reduction in the capacities of these interconnecting pipelines due to testing, line repair, reduced operating pressures, or other causes could result in reduced volumes being transported in ETPs pipelines. Similarly, if additional shippers begin transporting volumes of natural gas and NGLs over interconnecting pipelines, the allocations to existing shippers in these pipelines would be reduced, which could also reduce volumes transported in ETPs pipelines. Any reduction in volumes transported in ETPs pipelines would adversely affect its revenues and cash flow. ETP may be impacted by competition from other midstream, transportation and storage companies and propane companies. ETP experiences competition in all of its markets. ETPs principal areas of competition include obtaining natural gas supplies for the Southeast Texas System, North Texas System and HPL System and natural gas transportation customers for its transportation pipeline systems. ETPs competitors include major integrated oil companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather, compress, treat, process, transport, store and market natural gas. The Southeast Texas System competes with natural gas gathering and processing systems owned by DCP Midstream, LLC. The North Texas System competes with Crosstex North Texas Gathering, LP and Devon Gas Services, LP for gathering and processing. The East Texas pipeline competes with other natural gas transportation pipelines that serve the Bossier Sands area in east Texas and the Barnett Shale region in north Texas. The ET Fuel System and the Oasis pipeline compete with a number of other natural gas pipelines, including interstate and intrastate pipelines that link the Waha Hub. The ET Fuel System competes with other natural gas transportation pipelines serving the Dallas/Ft. Worth area and other pipelines that serve the east central Texas and south Texas markets. Pipelines that ETP competes with in these areas include those owned by Atmos Energy Corporation, Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and Enbridge, Inc. Some of ETPs competitors may have greater financial resources and access to larger natural gas supplies than it does. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The acquisitions of the HPL System and the Transwestern pipeline increased the number of interstate pipelines and natural gas markets to which ETP has access and expanded its principal areas of competition to areas such as southeast Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast. As a result of ETPs expanded market presence and diversification, ETP faces additional competitors, such as major integrated oil companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather, compress, treat, process, transport, store and market natural gas, which may have greater financial resources and access to larger natural gas supplies than ETP does. The Transwestern pipeline and the Midcontinent Express pipeline (and upon completion the Fayetteville Express and Tiger pipelines) compete with other interstate and intrastate pipeline companies in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service, access to sources of supply and the flexibility and reliability of service. Natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including for example, electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the capability to convert to alternate fuels and other factors, including weather and natural gas storage levels, affect the levels of natural gas transportation volumes in the areas served by our pipelines. ETPs propane business competes with a number of large national and regional propane companies and several thousand small independent propane companies. Because of the relatively low barriers to entry into the retail propane market, there is potential for small independent propane retailers, as well as other companies that may not currently be engaged in retail propane distribution, to compete with ETPs retail outlets. As a result, ETP is always subject to the risk of additional competition in the future. Generally, warmer-than-normal weather further intensifies competition. Most of ETPs retail propane branch locations compete with several other marketers or distributors in their service areas. The principal factors influencing competition with other retail propane marketers are:  price,  reliability and quality of service,  responsiveness to customer needs,  safety concerns,  long-standing customer relationships,  the inconvenience of switching tanks and suppliers, and  the lack of growth in the industry. The inability to continue to access tribal lands could adversely affect Transwesterns ability to operate its pipeline system and the inability to recover the cost of right-of-way grants on tribal lands could adversely affect its financial results. Transwesterns ability to operate its pipeline system on certain lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of a Native American Tribe, which we refer to as tribal lands, will depend on its success in maintaining existing rights-of-way and obtaining new rights-of-way on those tribal lands. Securing extensions of existing and any additional rights-of-way is also critical to Transwesterns ability to pursue expansion projects. We cannot provide any assurance that Transwestern will be able to acquire new rights-of-way on tribal lands or maintain access to existing rights-of-way upon the expiration of the current grants. Our financial position could be adversely affected if the costs of new or extended right-of-way grants cannot be recovered in rates. Transwesterns existing right-of-way agreements with the Navajo Nation, Southern Ute, Pueblo of Laguna and Fort Mojave tribes extend through November 2029, September 2020, December 2022 and April 2019, respectively. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ETP may be unable to bypass the processing plants, which could expose it to the risk of unfavorable processing margins. Because of ETPs ownership of the Oasis pipeline and ET Fuel System, it can generally elect to bypass ETPs processing plants when processing margins are unfavorable and instead deliver pipeline-quality gas by blending rich gas from the gathering systems with lean gas transported on the Oasis pipeline and ET Fuel System. In some circumstances, such as when ETP does not have a sufficient amount of lean gas to blend with the volume of rich gas that it receives at the processing plant, ETP may have to process the rich gas. If ETP has to process when processing margins are unfavorable, its results of operations will be adversely affected. ETP may be unable to retain existing customers or secure new customers, which would reduce its revenues and limit its future profitability. The renewal or replacement of existing contracts with ETPs customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control, including competition from other pipelines, and the price of, and demand for, natural gas in the markets ETP serves. For ETPs year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 26% of its sales of natural gas was to industrial end-users and utilities. As a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices, end-users and utilities are increasingly reluctant to enter into long-term purchase contracts. Many end-users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time. Some of these end-users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternate fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market. Because there are many companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with ETP in the marketing of natural gas, ETP often competes in the end-user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price. The inability of ETPs management to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on ETPs profitability. ETPs storage business may depend on neighboring pipelines to transport natural gas. To obtain natural gas, ETPs storage business depends on the pipelines to which they have access. Many of these pipelines are owned by parties not affiliated with ETP. Any interruption of service on those pipelines or adverse change in their terms and conditions of service could have a material adverse effect on ETPs ability, and the ability of its customers, to transport natural gas to and from its facilities and a corresponding material adverse effect on ETPs storage revenues. In addition, the rates charged by those interconnected pipelines for transportation to and from ETPs facilities affect the utilization and value of its storage services. Significant changes in the rates charged by those pipelines or the rates charged by other pipelines with which the interconnected pipelines compete could also have a material adverse effect on ETPs storage revenues. ETPs pipeline integrity program may cause it to incur significant costs and liabilities. ETPs pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the DOT, under the PHMSA, pursuant to which the PHMSA has established requirements relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. Moreover, the PHMSA, through the Office of Pipeline Safety, has promulgated a rule requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines, and take measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as high consequence areas. Activities under these integrity management programs involve the performance of internal pipeline inspections, pressure testing or other effective means to assess the integrity of these regulated pipeline segments, and the regulations require prompt action to address integrity issues raised by the assessment and analysis. Based on the results of ETPs current pipeline integrity testing programs, ETP estimates that compliance with these federal regulations and analogous state pipeline integrity requirements will result in capital costs of $20.5 million and operating and maintenance costs of $20.4 million over the course of the next year. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, $31.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, of capital costs and $18.5 million and $13.1 million, respectively, of operating and maintenance costs have been 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements incurred for pipeline integrity testing. Integrity testing and assessment of all of these assets will continue, and the potential exists that results of such testing and assessment could cause ETP to incur even greater capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of its pipelines. Since weather conditions may adversely affect demand for propane, ETPs financial conditions may be vulnerable to warm winters. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for heating purposes because the majority of ETPs customers rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel. Typically, ETP sells approximately two-thirds of its retail propane volume during the peak-heating season of October through March. ETPs results of operations can be adversely affected by warmer winter weather, which results in lower sales volumes. In addition, to the extent that warm weather or other factors adversely affect ETPs operating and financial results, its access to capital and its acquisition activities may be limited. Variations in weather in one or more of the regions where ETP operates can significantly affect the total volume of propane that ETP sells and the profits realized on these sales. Agricultural demand for propane may also be affected by weather, including unseasonably cold or hot periods or dry weather conditions that impact agricultural operations. A natural disaster, catastrophe or other event could result in severe personal injury, property damage and environmental damage, which could curtail ETPs operations and otherwise materially adversely affect its cash flow and, accordingly, affect the market price of its Common Units. Some of ETPs operations involve risks of personal injury, property damage and environmental damage, which could curtail its operations and otherwise materially adversely affect its cash flow. For example, natural gas facilities operate at high pressures, sometimes in excess of 1,100 pounds per square inch. Virtually all of ETPs operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, floods and/or earthquakes. If one or more facilities that are owned by ETP or that deliver natural gas or other products to ETP are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster, accident, catastrophe or event, ETPs operations could be significantly interrupted. Similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that supply ETPs facilities or other stoppages arising from factors beyond its control. These interruptions might involve significant damage to people, property or the environment, and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to six months or more for a major interruption. Any event that interrupts the revenues generated by ETPs operations, or which causes it to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce ETPs cash available for paying distributions to its Unitholders, including us, and accordingly, adversely affect the market price of its Common Units. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, ETP may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If ETP were to incur a significant liability for which it was not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on ETPs financial position and results of operations. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. Terrorist attacks aimed at ETPs facilities could adversely affect its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, including the nations pipeline infrastructure, may be the future target of terrorist organizations. Any terrorist attack on ETPs facilities or pipelines or those of its customers could have a material adverse effect on ETPs business. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sudden and sharp propane price increases that cannot be passed on to customers may adversely affect ETPs profit margins. The propane industry is a margin-based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales prices over supply costs. As a result, ETPs profitability is sensitive to changes in energy prices, and in particular, changes in wholesale prices of propane. When there are sudden and sharp increases in the wholesale cost of propane, ETP may be unable to pass on these increases to its customers through retail or wholesale prices. Propane is a commodity and the price ETP pays for it can fluctuate significantly in response to changes in supply or other market conditions over which ETP has no control. In addition, the timing of cost pass-throughs can significantly affect margins. Sudden and extended wholesale price increases could reduce ETPs gross profits and could, if continued over an extended period of time, reduce demand by encouraging ETPs retail customers to conserve their propane usage or convert to alternative energy sources. ETPs results of operations could be negatively impacted by price and inventory risk related to its propane business and management of these risks. ETP generally attempts to minimize its cost and inventory risk related to its propane business by purchasing propane on a short-term basis under supply contracts that typically have a one-year term and at a cost that fluctuates based on the prevailing market prices at major delivery points. In order to help ensure adequate supply sources are available during periods of high demand, ETP may purchase large volumes of propane during periods of low demand or low price, which generally occur during the summer months, for storage in its facilities, at major storage facilities owned by third parties or for future delivery. This strategy may not be effective in limiting ETPs cost and inventory risks if, for example, market, weather or other conditions prevent or allocate the delivery of physical product during periods of peak demand. If the market price falls below the cost at which ETP made such purchases, it could adversely affect its profits. Some of ETPs propane sales are pursuant to commitments at fixed prices. To mitigate the price risk related to ETPs anticipated sales volumes under the commitments, ETP may purchase and store physical product and/or enter into fixed price over-the-counter energy commodity forward contracts and options. Generally, over-the-counter energy commodity forward contracts have terms of less than one year. ETP enters into such contracts and exercises such options at volume levels that it believes are necessary to manage these commitments. The risk management of ETPs inventory and contracts for the future purchase of product could impair its profitability if the customers do not fulfill their obligations. ETP also engages in other trading activities, and may enter into other types of over-the-counter energy commodity forward contracts and options. These trading activities are based on ETP managements estimates of future events and prices and are intended to generate a profit. However, if those estimates are incorrect or other market events outside of ETPs control occur, such activities could generate a loss in future periods and potentially impair its profitability. ETP is dependent on its principal propane suppliers, which increases the risk of an interruption in supply. During 2009, ETP purchased approximately 50.3%, 14.3% and 15.1% of its propane from Enterprise, Targa and M.P. Oils, Ltd., respectively. Enterprise is a subsidiary of Enterprise GP, an entity that owns approximately 17.6% of ETEs outstanding Common Units and a 40.6% non-controlling equity interest in our General Partner. Titan purchases the majority of its propane from Enterprise pursuant to an agreement that expires in 2010 and contains renewal and extension options. If supplies from these sources were interrupted, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and, at least on a short-term basis, margins could be adversely affected. Supply from Canada is subject to the additional risk of disruption associated with foreign trade such as trade restrictions, shipping delays and political, regulatory and economic instability. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Historically, a substantial portion of the propane that ETP purchases originated from one of the industrys major markets located in Mt. Belvieu, Texas and has been shipped to ETP through major common carrier pipelines. Any significant interruption in the service at Mt. Belvieu or other major market points, or on the common carrier pipelines ETP uses, would adversely affect its ability to obtain propane. Competition from alternative energy sources may cause ETP to lose propane customers, thereby reducing its revenues. Competition in ETPs propane business from alternative energy sources has been increasing as a result of reduced regulation of many utilities. Propane is generally not competitive with natural gas in areas where natural gas pipelines already exist because natural gas is a less expensive source of energy than propane. The gradual expansion of natural gas distribution systems and the availability of natural gas in many areas that previously depended upon propane could cause ETP to lose customers, thereby reducing its revenues. Fuel oil also competes with propane and is generally less expensive than propane. In addition, the successful development and increasing usage of alternative energy sources could adversely affect ETPs operations. Energy efficiency and technological advances may affect the demand for propane and adversely affect ETPs operating results. The national trend toward increased conservation and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices, has decreased the demand for propane by retail customers. Stricter conservation measures in the future or technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices could adversely affect ETPs operations. Tax Risks to Common Unitholders Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat us or ETP as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or if we become subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, it would substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to Unitholders. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our Common Units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this matter. The value of our investment in ETP depends largely on ETP being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. If we are so treated, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and we would likely pay additional state income taxes as well. Distributions to Unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and none of our income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to Unitholders. Because a tax would then be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to Unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the Unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our Common Units. If ETP were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it would pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate. Distributions to us would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deduction or credits would flow through to us. As a result, there would be a material reduction in our anticipated cash flow, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Current law may change, causing us or ETP to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us or ETP to entity-level taxation. For example, members of Congress have recently considered substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that would have affected certain publicly traded partnerships. Specifically, federal income tax legislation has been considered that would have eliminated partnership tax treatment for certain publicly traded partnerships and recharacterizes certain types of income received from partnerships. We or ETP are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will be reintroduced or will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our or ETPs Common Units. Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us. The tax treatment of our structure is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of Unitholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law. The U.S. federal income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, and the U.S. Treasury Department, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to Treasury Regulations and other modifications and interpretations. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our Common Units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation (referred to as the Qualifying Income Exception), affect or cause us to change our business activities, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us, change the character or treatment of portions of our income and adversely affect an investment in our Common Units. For example, in response to certain recent developments, members of Congress are considering substantive changes to the definition of qualifying income under Internal Revenue Code section 7704(d). It is possible that these efforts could result in changes to the existing U.S. federal tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including us. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our Common Units. If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we or ETP takes, the market for our Common Units or ETP Common Units may be adversely affected and the costs of any such contest will reduce cash available for distributions to our Unitholders. Neither we nor ETP have requested a ruling from IRS with respect to our treatment as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we or ETP take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we or ETP take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we or ETP take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our Common Units or ETPs Common Units and the prices at which they trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne by us or ETP, and therefore indirectly by us, as a Unitholder and as the owner of the general partner of ETP, reducing the cash available for distribution to our Unitholders. Unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. Because our Unitholders will be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, Unitholders will be required to pay any federal income taxes and, 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they receive no cash distributions from us. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from the taxation of their share of our taxable income. In such case, Unitholders would still be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income regardless of the amount, if any, of any cash distributions they receive from us. Tax gain or loss on disposition of our Common Units could be more or less than expected. If Unitholders sell their Common Units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the tax basis in those Common Units. Because distributions in excess of the Unitholders allocable share of our net taxable income decrease the Unitholders tax basis in their Common Units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units sold will, in effect, become taxable income to the Unitholder if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price received is less than their original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a Unitholders share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if a Unitholder sells units, the Unitholders may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale. Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning Common Units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them. Investment in Common Units by tax-exempt entities, including employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs) and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to Unitholders who are organizations exempt from federal income tax, may be taxable to them as unrelated business taxable income. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes, at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file United States federal income tax returns and generally pay tax on their share of our taxable income. We treat each purchaser of Common Units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual Common Units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could result in a Unitholder owing more tax and may adversely affect the value of the Common Units. The IRS may challenge the manner in which we calculate our Unitholders basis adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If so, because neither we nor a Unitholder can identify the units to which this issue relates once the initial holder has traded them, the IRS may assert adjustments to all Unitholders selling units within the period under audit as if all Unitholders owned such units. Any position we take that is inconsistent with applicable Treasury Regulations may have to be disclosed on our federal income tax return. This disclosure increases the likelihood that the IRS will challenge our positions and propose adjustments to some or all of our Unitholders. A successful IRS challenge to this position or other positions we may take could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss allocated to our Unitholders. It also could affect the gain from a Unitholders sale of Common Units and could have a negative impact on the value of the Common Units or result in audit adjustments to our Unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions. Moreover, because one of our subsidiaries that is organized as a C corporation for federal income tax purposes owns units in us, a successful IRS challenge could result in this subsidiary having more tax liability than we anticipate and, therefore, reduce the cash available for distribution to our partnership and, in turn, to our Unitholders. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our Unitholders. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. Recently, however, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. Although publicly traded partnerships are entitled to rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations, they are not binding on the IRS and are subject to change until final Treasury Regulations are issued. A Unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the Unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. Because a Unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units, the Unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the Unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the Unitholder and any cash distributions received by the Unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units. ETP has adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between us and the public Unitholders of ETP. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of ETPs Common Units and our Common Units. When we or ETP issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, ETP determines the fair market value of its assets and allocates any unrealized gain or loss attributable to such assets to the capital accounts of ETPs Unitholders and us. Although ETP may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, including the valuation of its assets, ETP makes many of the fair market value estimates of its assets itself using a methodology based on the market value of its Common Units as a means to measure the fair market value of its assets. ETPs methodology may be viewed as understating the value of ETPs assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain ETP Unitholders and us, which may be unfavorable to such ETP Unitholders. Moreover, under our current valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of our Common Units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to ETPs tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to ETPs intangible assets. The IRS may challenge ETPs valuation methods, or our or ETPs allocation of Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to ETPs tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between us and certain of ETPs Unitholders. A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our Unitholders or the ETP Unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain on the sale of Common Units by our Unitholders or ETPs Unitholders and could have a negative impact on the value of our Common Units or those of ETP or result in audit adjustments to the tax returns of our or ETPs Unitholders without the benefit of additional deductions. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes. We will be considered to have terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in our filing two tax returns for one fiscal year and may result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but it would result in our being treated as a new partnership for tax purposes. If we were treated as a new partnership, we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we were unable to determine that a termination occurred. Unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in our Common Units. In addition to federal income taxes, the Unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we or ETP conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of the jurisdictions. Further, Unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is the responsibility of each Unitholder to file all federal, state and local tax returns. ITEM 1B.
