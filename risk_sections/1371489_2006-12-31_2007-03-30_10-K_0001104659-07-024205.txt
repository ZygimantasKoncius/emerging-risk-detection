Item 1A. Risk Factors Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Any prospective holder of our securities should consider carefully all of the material risks described below before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline. In addition, to the extent that any of the information contained in this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including as a result of the risks described below. Risks Associated with Our Business We are a development stage company with no operating history and, accordingly, our stockholders do not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. We are a recently incorporated development stage company with no operating results to date. Since we do not have an operating history, our stockholders have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to acquire an operating business in the information services industry. We have no present revenues and will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination. We can make no assurance as to when or if an initial business combination will occur. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and are forced to dissolve and liquidate the trust account, our public stockholders will receive less than $8.00 per share (the price at which we sold our units in our initial public offering) and our warrants will expire worthless. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed timeframes and are forced to dissolve and liquidate our assets as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution, the per share liquidation distribution will be less than $8.00 (the price at which we sold our units in our initial public offering) because of the expenses of our initial public offering, our general and administrative expenses and the anticipated costs of seeking an initial business combination, which may include using a portion of the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a down payment, lock-up or no-shop provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination. If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of warrants which was effectuated contemporaneously with our initial public offering (the private placement), other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account any interest earned on the trust account or 16 taxes payable on such interest, the initial per share liquidation price would be $7.85, or $0.15 less than the per unit offering price of $8.00, assuming that amount was not further reduced by claims of creditors. We can make no assurance that the actual per share liquidation price will not be less than $7.85. In the event that our board of directors recommends and our stockholders approve a plan of dissolution and distribution and it is subsequently determined that our reserves for claims and liabilities to third parties are insufficient, stockholders who receive funds from our trust account could be liable up to such amounts to creditors. Furthermore, there will be no distribution with respect to our outstanding warrants, which will expire worthless if we liquidate before the completion of a business combination. For a more complete discussion of the effects on our stockholders if we are unable to complete a business combination, see the section in Item 1 above entitled Effecting a Business CombinationPlan of dissolution and distribution if no business combination. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering not being placed in the trust account together with interest earned on the trust account available to us are not sufficient to allow us to operate until February 6, 2009, we may be unable to complete a business combination. We believe that, the funds available to us outside of the trust account, including up to $3,000,000 of interest earned from the trust account that may be released to us, will be sufficient to allow us to operate until at least February 7, 2009, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time. However, we can make no assurance that our estimates will be accurate. We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in the trust account to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. Additionally, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in the trust account as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we did and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. Our public stockholders are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies. Since the net proceeds of our initial public offering are intended to be used to complete a business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the United States securities laws. However, since we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 and have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC following the consummation of our initial public offering which included an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies such as Rule 419. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, our units are currently tradable and we have a longer period of time to complete a business combination in certain circumstances than we would if were subject to Rule 419. If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share liquidation price received by stockholders from the trust account as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution will be less than $7.85 per share. Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we execute agreements waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements, and the execution of such an agreement is not a condition to our doing business with anyone. Even if they do execute such agreements, they would not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary 17 responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver only if management believed that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to claims that could take priority over the claims of our public stockholders and the per share liquidation price could be less than the initial $7.85 per share held in the trust account, plus interest (net of (1) any taxes due on such interest, which taxes, if any, shall be paid from the trust account and (2) any amounts that may have been released to us to fund working capital requirements), due to claims of such creditors. If we are unable to complete a business combination and are forced to liquidate, each of our executive officers has jointly and severally agreed to reimburse us for our debts to vendors for services rendered or products sold to us, or to any prospective target business, if we do not obtain a valid and enforceable waiver from that vendor or prospective target business of its rights or claims to the trust account and only to the extent necessary to ensure that such claims do not reduce the amount in the trust account. Based on the information provided to us in the director and officer questionnaires provided to us in connection with our initial public offering as well as the representations as to their accredited investor status (as such term is defined in Regulation D), we currently believe that such persons are of substantial means and capable of funding their indemnity obligations, even though we have not asked them to reserve for such an eventuality. However, we can make no assurance that our executive officers will be able to satisfy those obligations. In addition, our executive officers have not agreed to reimburse us for any debts or obligations to vendors that do not represent service fees (and related disbursements) or product purchase prices but relate to a potential tort claim. We believe the likelihood of our executive officers having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we intend to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claims of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. In the event that our board recommends and our stockholders approve a plan of dissolution and distribution and it is subsequently determined that our reserve for claims and liabilities to third parties is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for up to such amounts to creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary case is filed against us that is not dismissed, the funds held in our trust account will be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account the per share liquidation distribution would be less than the initial $7.85 per share held in the trust account. We will dissolve and liquidate if we do not consummate a business combination and our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them. We will dissolve and disburse the funds in our trust account to our public stockholders if we do not complete a business combination prior to August 6, 2008, the eighteen month anniversary of the consummation of our initial public offering (or February 6, 2009 if certain extension criteria are satisfied). 18 There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants which will expire worthless. Under Sections 280 through 282 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims, whether existing, pending or that may be potentially brought against it within a ten year period, by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. If the corporation complies with certain procedures intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all such claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim and the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. Although we will seek stockholder approval to liquidate the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution, we do not intend to comply with these procedures of the DGCL. In the event that the board of directors recommends and the stockholders approve a plan of dissolution and distribution and it is subsequently determined that our reserve for claims and liabilities to third parties was insufficient, stockholders who received funds could be liable for claims (whether existing, pending or that may be potentially brought against us within a ten year period) for up to such amounts to creditors. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any such claims to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such dissolution. We can make no assurance that third parties will not seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us. We cannot predict with certainty the extent to which the funds held in the trust account will be available for distribution to our stockholders in the event we dissolve and liquidate. We cannot predict with certainty: (i) actual or potential claims or lawsuits that may be brought against us; (ii) what waiver agreements, if any, we will be able to obtain from vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses; (iii) the amount of additional expenses that we may incur that exceeds the amount of funds held outside of the trust; or (iv) the ability of our management to ensure that the proceeds held in the trust account are not reduced by claims of target businesses or vendors. To the extent we are required to make payments in respect of or provide for any such claims, lawsuits, expenses or other costs, the amount of funds held in the trust account for payment to our stockholders will be reduced. The procedures we must follow under Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation if we dissolve and liquidate may result in substantial delays in the liquidation of our trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution. Pursuant to, among other documents, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we do not complete a business combination prior to August 6, 2008, the date which is the eighteen month anniversary of the consummation of our initial public offering (or prior to February 6, 2009 if certain extension criteria have been satisfied), we will be required to dissolve, liquidate and wind up in compliance with the provisions of the DGCL. In addition, in the event we seek stockholder approval for a plan of dissolution and distribution and do not obtain such approval, we will nonetheless continue to pursue stockholder approval for our dissolution. If we do not consummate a business combination, the funds held in our trust account may not be distributed except to our stockholders upon our dissolution and, unless and until such approval is obtained from our stockholders, the funds held in our trust account will not be released. Consequently, holders of a majority of our outstanding stock must approve our dissolution in order to receive the funds held in our trust account and the funds will not be available for any other corporate purpose. The procedures required for us to liquidate under the DGCL, or a vote to reject any plan of dissolution and distribution by our stockholders, may result in substantial delays in the 19 liquidation of our trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution. If we do not consummate a business combination and dissolve, payments from the trust account to our public stockholders may be delayed. We currently believe that any plan of dissolution and distribution subsequent to the expiration of the 18 and 24-month deadlines described above would proceed in approximately the following manner: · our board of directors will, consistent with its obligations described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to dissolve, prior to the passing of such deadline, convene and adopt a specific plan of dissolution and distribution, which it will then vote to recommend to our stockholders; at such time it will also cause to be prepared a preliminary proxy statement setting out the plan of dissolution and distribution as well as the boards recommendation of the plan; · upon such deadline, we would file our preliminary proxy statement with the SEC; · if the SEC does not review the preliminary proxy statement, then, 10 days following the passing of such deadline, we will mail the proxy statements to our stockholders, and 30 days following the passing of such deadline we will convene a meeting of our stockholders, at which they will either approve or reject our plan of dissolution and distribution; and · if the SEC does review the preliminary proxy statement, we currently estimate that we will receive such comments within approximately 30 days following the passing of such deadline. We will mail the proxy statements to our stockholders following the conclusion of the comment and review process (the length of which we cannot predict with any certainty, and which may be substantial) and we will convene a meeting of our stockholders at which they will either approve or reject our plan of dissolution and distribution. In the event we seek stockholder approval for a plan of dissolution and distribution and do not obtain such approval, we will nonetheless continue to pursue stockholder approval for our dissolution. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our powers following the expiration of the permitted time periods for consummating a business combination will automatically be limited to acts and activities relating to dissolving and winding up our affairs, including liquidation. If we do not consummate a business combination, the funds held in our trust account may not be distributed except to our stockholders upon our dissolution and, unless and until approval is obtained from our stockholders, the funds held in our trust account will not be released. Consequently, holders of a majority of our outstanding stock must approve our dissolution in order to receive the funds held in our trust account, net of any payments, which may be required to be made in respect of income tax obligations, and the funds will not be available for any other corporate purpose. These procedures, or a vote to reject any plan of dissolution and distribution by our stockholders, may result in substantial delays in the liquidation of our trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution. 20 Since we have not currently selected any target business with which to complete a business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the operations of that business. Since we have not yet identified a prospective target business, our stockholders have no current basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the operations of that business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we can make no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also can make no assurance that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business. For a more complete discussion of our selection of a target business, see the section in Item 1 above entitled Effecting a Business CombinationWe have not identified a target business. We may seek investment opportunities in industries outside of our target industry (which industries may or may not be outside of our managements area of expertise). Although we intend to focus on identifying acquisition candidates in our target industry and we will not initially actively seek to identify acquisition candidates in other industries (which industries may or may not be outside of our managements area of expertise), we will consider an acquisition outside of our target industry if (i) an acquisition candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive investment opportunity for our company or (ii) we are unable to identify a suitable candidate in the target industry after having expended some amount of time and effort in an attempt to do so. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular acquisition candidate, we can make no assurance that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also can make no assurance that an investment in our securities will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to our stockholders than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in an acquisition candidate. Subject to the limitations that our business combination must have a fair market value of at least 80% of our net assets at the time of the acquisition (all of our assets, including the funds held in the trust account other than the deferred underwriting discount, less our liabilities), we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. In addition, because there is no limitation on our ability to raise additional capital through equity placements or through loans, we may be able to acquire a company with a fair market value in an amount greater than 80% of our net assets at the time. We can also satisfy the requirement that the business combination have a fair market value at least equal to 80% of our net assets in an acquisition transaction where we acquire less than a 100% interest in the target business, provided that the fair market value of the interest in such business or businesses is at least equal to 80% of our net assets at the time such acquisition transaction is consummated. Under Delaware law, the requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended, which could reduce or eliminate the protection afforded to our stockholders by such requirements and restrictions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of a business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 21 · upon consummation of our initial public offering, a certain amount of the proceeds from the offering will be placed into the trust account (in connection with this requirement, on February 6, 2007, an amount equal to $254,050,000 was so placed into the trust account), and these funds may not be disbursed from the trust account to our stockholders except upon our liquidation or in the event a stockholder exercises the conversion right set forth below, provided that up to $3,000,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable on this interest) may be released to us to cover a portion of our operating expenses; · prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will submit such business combination to our stockholders for approval; · we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by the public stockholders and only if public stockholders owning less than 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering exercise their conversion rights; · if our initial business combination is approved and consummated, public stockholders who voted against the business combination and exercised their conversion rights will receive their pro rata share of the trust account, including their pro rata portion of the deferred underwriting discount and all accrued interest (net of (1) income taxes payable on the interest income on the trust account and (2) up to $3,000,000 of interest income on the trust account balance, net of income taxes payable on this amount, released to us to fund working capital requirements); · if our initial business combination is not consummated or a letter of intent, an agreement in principle or a definitive agreement is not signed within the eighteen or twenty-four month time periods described above: · our corporate purposes and powers will immediately thereupon be limited to acts and activities relating to dissolving and winding up our affairs, including liquidation, and we will not be able to engage in any other business activities; and · our board of directors will be required to adopt, within 15 days after the expiration of the allotted time periods, a resolution pursuant to Section 275(a) of the DGCL finding our dissolution advisable and provide notices to our stockholders as required by Section 275(a) as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter; and · our initial business combination must have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of our net assets at the time of such business combination (all of our assets, including the funds held in the trust account other than the deferred underwriting discount, less our liabilities). Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that we obtain unanimous consent of our stockholders to amend the above-described provisions. However, the validity of unanimous consent provisions under Delaware law has not been settled. A court could conclude that the unanimous consent requirement constitutes a practical prohibition on amendment in violation of the stockholders implicit rights to amend the corporate charter. In that case, the above-described provisions would be amendable without unanimous consent and any such amendment could reduce or eliminate the protection afforded to our stockholders. However, we view the foregoing provisions, including the requirement that the public stockholders owning less than 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering exercise their conversion rights in order for our initial business combination to be consummated, as obligations to 22 our stockholders, and we will not take any action to waive or amend any of these provisions, including by seeking to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase or decrease this threshold. Because we are a blank check company, it may be difficult for us to complete a business combination during the prescribed time period. As of March 15, 2007, and based upon publicly available information, we have identified approximately 92 blank check companies that have gone public since August 2003. Of these companies, only 22 have completed a business combination, while five will be liquidating. The remaining approximately 65 blank check companies have more than $5.7 billion in trust and are seeking to complete business acquisitions. Of these companies, only 19 have announced that they have entered into definitive agreements or letters of intent with respect to potential business combinations but have not yet consummated business combinations. Accordingly, there are approximately 46 blank check companies with more than $3.8 billion in trust that have filed registration statements and are seeking, or will be seeking, to complete business combinations. Furthermore, the fact that only 22 of such companies have completed business combinations and only 19 other of such companies have entered into definitive agreements for business combinations, and five will be liquidating, may be an indication that there are only a limited number of attractive targets available to such entities or that many targets are not inclined to enter into a transaction with a blank check company, and therefore we also may not be able to consummate a business combination within the prescribed time period. If we are unable to consummate an initial transaction within the prescribed time period, our purpose will be limited to dissolving, liquidating and winding up. We may issue shares of our capital stock to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of March 29, 2007 there were 17,914,063 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock available for issuance (after appropriate reservation for the issuance of shares upon full exercise of our outstanding warrants and the underwriters unit purchase option). Although we currently have no commitments to issue our securities, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, or a combination of common and preferred stock, to complete a business combination. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or any number of shares of our preferred stock: · may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders; · may cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and may also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; · may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our securities; and · may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock. For a more complete discussion of the possible structure of a business combination, see the section in Item 1 above entitled Effecting a Business CombinationSelection of a target business and structuring of a business combination. 23 We may issue debt securities or otherwise incur substantial debt to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition. Although we currently have no commitments to issue any debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete a business combination. If we issue debt securities, it could result in: · default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to pay our debt obligations; · acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt security contains covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and any such covenant is breached without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; · our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and · our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding. For a more complete discussion of the possible structure of a business combination, see the section in Item 1 above entitled Effecting a Business CombinationSelection of a target business and structuring of a business combination. Our ability to effect a business combination and to execute any potential business plan afterwards will be dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following a business combination and whom we may have only a limited ability to evaluate. Our ability to effect a business combination will be dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The future role of our key personnel following a business combination, however, cannot presently be fully ascertained. Although we expect most of our management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, to remain associated with us following a business combination, we may employ other personnel following the business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any additional individuals we engage after a business combination, we can make no assurance that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. If we acquired a target business in an all-cash transaction, it would be more likely that current members of management would remain with us if they chose to do so. If a business combination were structured as a merger whereby the stockholders of the target company were to control the combined company following a business combination, it may be less likely that management would remain with the combined company unless it was negotiated as part of the transaction via the acquisition agreement, an employment agreement or other arrangement. In making the determination as to whether current management should remain with us following the business combination, management will analyze the experience and skill set of the target business management and negotiate as part of the business combination that certain members of current management remain if it is believed that it is in the best interests of the combined company post-business combination. Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business in connection with evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we can make no assurance that our assessment of the target businesss management will prove to be correct. 24 Our current management may have a conflict of interest in connection with negotiating the terms of our initial business combination. Since our current management will negotiate the terms of our initial business combination and may negotiate the terms of their employment or consulting arrangements, our current management may have a conflict of interest in attempting to negotiate terms that are favorable to our public stockholders in the acquisition agreement at the same time that they are negotiating terms in their employment or consulting arrangements that are favorable to them. Our officers, directors and senior advisors will allocate their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs and our officers may do so. This could impact our ability to consummate a business combination. Our officers, directors and senior advisors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees, other than those employed merely in an administrative capacity, prior to the consummation of a business combination. Our executive officers are also not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our executive officers other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could impact our ability to consummate a business combination. Some of our officers, directors and senior advisors are currently affiliated with entities which may have existing or potential interests in our target industry engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicting fiduciary duties in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. Certain of our officers, directors and senior advisors are currently affiliated with other entities that may have existing or potential interests in our target industry following a business combination. Due to these existing affiliations, they may have conflicting fiduciary obligations with regard to presenting certain potential business opportunities to those entities that may be of interest to us. Our directors and senior advisors may in the future become affiliated with other entities, including other blank check companies, engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. We may seek a business combination with a target business with which one or more of our existing officers, directors and senior advisors may be affiliated. Our existing officers, directors and senior advisors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities to consummate a business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, whether by virtue of the sale of assets, spin-off, divestiture or otherwise, and there have been no preliminary discussions or indications of interest with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting any, transaction with any affiliated entities, we would consider such a transaction if any such opportunity were presented to us, without first seeking to consummate a business combination with a non-affiliated entity, although we are currently unaware of any such actual or potential transaction. If we become aware of and pursue an opportunity to seek a business combination with a target business with which one or more of our existing officers, directors or senior advisors may be affiliated, conflicts of interest could arise in connection with negotiating the terms of and completing the business combination. Accordingly, such officers, directors and senior advisors may become subject to conflicts of interest regarding us and other business ventures in which they may be involved, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to consummate a business combination. Management intends to comply with the requirements of Delaware Law with respect to any such transaction. In order to 25 minimize these potential conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate a business combination with an entity that is affiliated with our principal stockholder, officers, directors or senior advisors unless we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. All of our officers, directors and senior advisors beneficially own shares of our common stock (and warrants to purchase shares of common stock, in the case of our officers) which will not participate in liquidation distributions, and therefore they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination. All of our officers, directors and senior advisors own stock (and warrants to purchase shares of common stock, in the case of our officers) in our company, either directly or indirectly, but have waived their right to receive distributions upon our liquidation as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution. The shares and warrants owned by our officers, directors and senior advisors will be worthless if we do not consummate a business combination. The personal and financial interests of our officers, directors and senior advisors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business and in timely completing a business combination. Consequently, our officers, directors and senior advisors discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our public stockholders best interest. It is probable that we will be able to complete only one business combination, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business and a limited number of products or services. The net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement, after the payment of certain offering expenses, provided us with approximately $254,050,000 (including the $8,262,500 deferred underwriting discount payable upon consummation of a business combination), which we may use to complete a business combination. Our initial business combination must have a fair market value of at least 80% of our net assets at the time of such acquisition (all of our assets, including the funds held in the trust account other than the deferred underwriting discount, less our liabilities). Consequently, it is probable that we will have the ability to complete only a single business combination. Accordingly, the prospects for our ability to effect our acquisition strategy may be: · solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or · dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. In this case, we will not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities that may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. The ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. When we seek stockholder approval of any business combination, we will offer each public stockholder the right to have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash if the stockholder votes against the business combination and if the business combination is approved and completed. Such holder must both vote against such business combination and then exercise his, her or its conversion rights to receive the conversion price. Accordingly, if our business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many stockholders 26 may exercise such conversion rights, we may either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such conversion or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination in case a larger percentage of stockholders exercise their conversion rights than we expect. Therefore, we may not be able to consummate a business combination that requires us to use all of the funds held in the trust account as part of the purchase price, or we may end up having a leverage ratio that is not optimal for our business combination. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us. We will depend on interest earned on the trust account balance to fund a portion of our search for a target business or businesses and to complete our initial business combination. Of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, $500,000 was available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to provide us with additional working capital that we may need to identify one or more target businesses and to complete our initial business combination. While we are entitled to have released to us from the trust account for such purposes interest income, net of income taxes on such interest, of up to a maximum of $3,000,000, a substantial decline in interest rates may result in our having insufficient funds available with which to structure, negotiate or close an initial business combination. In such event, we would need to obtain additional funds from our initial stockholders or another source to continue operations, or we may be forced to liquidate. None of our officers, directors, senior advisors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us. We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure the transaction or to abandon a particular business combination. Although we believe that the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement will be sufficient to allow us to consummate a business combination, because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of the business combination or the depletion of the available net proceeds in the search for a target business, or because we become obligated to convert into cash a significant number of shares from converting stockholders, we will be required to seek additional financing. We can make no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing is unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we will be compelled to restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing may stall the development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors, senior advisors or principal stockholder is required to provide any financing to us. Our officers, directors and senior advisors control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote. As of March 29, 2007, our officers, directors and senior advisors collectively own, directly or indirectly, 8,067,187 shares of common stock or approximately 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 6,500,000 shares of common stock. As a result, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders that addresses any matter other than a business combination, our officers, directors and senior advisors, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome of all matters requiring approval by our stockholders at 27 such time, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, following the consummation of our business combination. Our outstanding warrants and option may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination. In connection with our initial public offering, as part of the units, we issued warrants to purchase 32,343,750 shares of our common stock. We also issued an option to purchase an aggregate of 1,406,250 units to the underwriters (the underwriters unit purchase option), which, if exercised on a cash basis, will result in the issuance of an additional 1,406,250 warrants and an additional 1,406,250 shares. Our officers also have indirect beneficial ownership of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares, which shares are issuable upon exercise of these warrants so purchased in the private placement. To the extent that we desire to issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of substantial numbers of additional shares upon exercise of these warrants and the underwriters unit purchase option could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business as such securities, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our warrants and the underwriters unit purchase option may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants and the underwriters unit purchase option could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future public financing. If and to the extent these warrants and this option are exercised, our stockholders will experience dilution in their equity holdings. Holders of warrants will not be able to exercise their warrants in the event we are unable to maintain an effective registration statement with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. No warrants will be exercisable unless at the time of exercise a prospectus relating to common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the common stock has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Although we have agreed to meet these conditions and use our reasonable best efforts to maintain a current prospectus relating to common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants, we can make no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we fail to register the shares of common stock underlying the warrants or have them qualified for an exemption under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants, holders of warrants will not be entitled to exercise the warrants and as a result, the warrants may be deprived of any value and the market for the warrants may be limited. We are not obligated to pay cash or other consideration to the holders of the warrants in such circumstance or under other circumstances and the warrants could become, and later expire, worthless. Because the warrants we sold in the private placement were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under the federal securities laws, the holders of the warrants purchased in the private placement will be able to exercise their warrants even if, at the time of exercise, a prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the initial public offering is not current. As a result, the holders of the warrants purchased in the private placement will not have any restrictions with respect to the exercise of their warrants. As described above, the holders of the warrants purchased in our initial public offering will not be able to exercise them unless we have a current registration statement covering the shares issuable upon their exercise. 28 Holders of the underwriters unit purchase option will not be able to exercise their option or the warrants issuable upon exercise of such option in the event we are unable to maintain an effective registration statement with respect to the option, the units and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the option and the warrants. Holders of the underwriters unit purchase option will not be able to exercise this option or the warrants issuable upon exercise of such option in the event we are unable to maintain an effective registration statement with respect to the option, the units and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the option and the warrants. If we fail to register the option, the units and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the option and the warrants, holders of such option will not be entitled to exercise the option or the underlying warrants. We are not obligated to pay cash or other consideration to the holders of the option in such a circumstance or under any other circumstances and the option and the underlying warrants could become, and later expire, worthless. If our stockholders prior to the consummation of our initial public offering and Oenoke Partners, LLC, the purchaser of warrants which we issued to it concurrently with our initial public offering, exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination. The holders of our common stock prior to the consummation of our initial public offering are entitled to require us to register the resale of their shares of common stock which were held prior to our initial public offering at any time after the date on which their shares are released from their lock-up. In addition, Oenoke Partners, LLC, the holder of the warrants which we issued to it concurrently with our initial public offering, can demand that we register those warrants and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants at anytime after such warrants become exercisable by their terms. If such stockholders and Oenoke Partners, LLC exercise their registration rights with respect to all of their shares of common stock and warrants, then there will be an additional 8,085,937 shares of common stock, and 6,500,000 warrants and/or up to 6,500,000 shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrants, that will be eligible for trading in the public market. The presence of this additional number of securities eligible for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or may request a higher price for their securities as a result of these registration rights and the potential future effect their exercise may have on the trading market for our common stock. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our activities may be restricted, including: · restrictions on the nature of our investments; and · restrictions on the issuance of securities, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: 29 · registration as an investment company; · adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and · reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. To this end, the proceeds of our initial public offering held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity date of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Our initial public offering was not intended for persons seeking a return on investments in government securities or money market funds. The trust account and the purchase of government securities or money market funds for the trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of our primary business objective, which is a business combination and (ii) absent a business combination, our dissolution and return of the funds held in this trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve a plan of dissolution and distribution and the funds remain in the trust account for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act. If we were deemed to be subject to the act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not accounted. Our officers, directors and senior advisors will not be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them to the extent that such expenses exceed the amount of available proceeds not held in the trust account unless the business combination is consummated, and therefore they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination and in the public stockholders best interest. Our officers, directors and senior advisors will not be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them to the extent that such expenses exceed the amount of available proceeds not held in the trust account unless the business combination is consummated. The financial interest of our officers, directors or senior advisors could influence their motivation in selecting a target business, and thus there may be a conflict of interest when determining whether a particular business combination is in the stockholders best interest. The American Stock Exchange may delist our securities, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. Our securities are currently listed on the American Stock Exchange, a national securities exchange. We can make no assurance that our securities will continue to be listed on the American Stock Exchange. Additionally, in connection with our business combination, it is likely that the American Stock Exchange may require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. We can make no assurance that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at the time of our business combination. If the American Stock Exchange delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant consequences including: 30 · reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; · a determination that our common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; · limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and · a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. Risks Associated with the Information Services Industry We intend to focus our search on target businesses in the information services industry. We believe that the following risks will apply to us following the completion of a business combination with a target business in the information services industry. If, following a business combination, the products or services that we market or sell are not accepted by the public, our results of operations will be adversely affected. The information services industry is dependent on developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing client needs and tastes. We can make no assurance that the products and services of a target business with which we effect a business combination will gain market acceptance. Any significant delay or failure in developing new product and service offerings, could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues. The information services industry is competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability upon consummation of a business combination. The information services industry is rapidly evolving and competitive. Many of the competitors we would face upon consummation of a business combination may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, the management of our competitors may have greater operating resources and experience in their respective industries. Some of these competitors may also offer a wider range of services than we can and have greater name recognition and a larger client base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. They may also be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to clients, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. If we are unable to compete effectively following a business combination, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Changes in legislative, judicial, regulatory, cultural or consumer environments relating to consumer privacy or information collection and use may affect our ability to collect and use data. Privacy concerns could lead to the enactment of legislation or industry regulations, the issuance of judicial interpretations, or simply a change in customs that could place limitations on our ability to collect, maintain and use information about internet consumers following a business combination. Such limitations could result in a material increase in the cost of collecting some kinds of data or could prevent us from operating or distributing some of our products and services following a business combination. Failure to comply with the law and regulatory requirements may result in criminal or civil liability. The 31 occurrence of one or more of these events could materially harm our business, results of operation and financial condition following a business combination. Industry consolidation could result in increased competition for the products and services we expect to provide following a business combination. The possibility of the consolidation or merger of companies which might combine forces to create a single-source provider of multiple services to the marketplace in which we expect to compete could result in increased competition for us. The dynamics of the marketplace could be significantly altered if some of the single-service providers were to combine with each other to provide a wider variety of services, which could adversely affect our targets business, financial position and operating results. We may be unable to protect or enforce the intellectual property rights of any target businesses that we acquire. After completing a business combination, the procurement and protection of trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets may be critical to our success. We will likely rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect any proprietary technology and rights that we may acquire. Despite our efforts to protect that proprietary technology and those rights, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of those proprietary rights or deter independent development of technologies that compete with the business we acquire. Our competitors may file patent applications or obtain patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. It is also possible that third parties may claim we have infringed their patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights. Claims or litigation, with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and business. Depending on the target business or businesses that we acquire, it is likely that we will have to protect copyrights, trademarks, patents, and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location. With respect to certain proprietary rights, such as trademarks and copyrighted materials, of the target business or businesses that we will acquire, we expect that the target business or businesses would have entered into license agreements in the past and will continue to enter into such agreements in the future. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of such target business or businesses proprietary rights or cause harm to such target business or businesses reputation. If we are alleged to have infringed on the intellectual property or other rights of third parties, it could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights. If, following a business combination, third parties allege that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity rights or have defamed them we could become a party to litigation. These claims and any resulting lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights and restrict our ability to publish and distribute the infringing or defaming content. Changes in technology may reduce the demand for the products or services we may offer following a business combination. The information services industry is affected by rapid and significant changes in technology. These changes may reduce the demand for certain existing products and services and technologies used in the industry or render them obsolete. We can make no assurance that the technologies used by or relied 32 upon or produced by a target business with which we effect a business combination will not be subject to such reduction in demand or obsolescence. While we may attempt to adapt and apply the services provided by the target business to newer technologies, we can make no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to fund these changes or that these changes will ultimately prove successful. Since we may acquire a business that is located outside the United States, we may encounter risks specific to one or more countries in which we ultimately operate. If we acquire a business that has operations outside the United States, we will be exposed to risks that could negatively impact our future results of operations following a business combination. The additional risks to which we may be exposed in any such case include but are not limited to: · tariffs and trade barriers; · regulations related to customs and import/export matters; · tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; · cultural and language differences; · an inadequate banking system; · foreign exchange controls; · restrictions on the repatriation of profits or payment of dividends; · crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; · nationalization or expropriation of property; · law enforcement authorities and courts that are inexperienced in commercial matters; and · deterioration of political relations with the United States. Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our business and financial results. A target business with which we combine may do business and generate sales within other countries. Foreign currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in such international operations. It is also possible that some or all of our operating expenses may be incurred in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies in those countries where we have operations against the U.S. dollar would increase our costs and could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
