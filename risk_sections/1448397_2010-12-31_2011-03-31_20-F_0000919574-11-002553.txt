D. Risk Factors Some of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and our business in general. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our securities could decline. The dry bulk carrier charter market has sustained significant fluctuations since October 2008, which has adversely affected our revenues, earnings and profitability and may require us to raise additional capital in order to remain compliant with our loan covenants and loan covenant waivers and affect our ability to pay dividends in the future. The abrupt and dramatic downturn in the dry bulk charter market, from which we have derived substantially all of our revenues, has severely affected the dry bulk shipping industry and has harmed our business. The Baltic Dry Index, or BDI, declined from a high of 11,793 in May 2008 to a low of 663 in December 2008, which represents a decline of 94%. Over the comparable period of May through December 2008, the high and low of the Baltic Capesize Index, the Baltic Panamax Index, the Baltic Supramax Index and the Baltic Handysize Index represent declines of 96%, 96%, 94% and 92%, respectively. During 2009, the BDI increased from a low of 772 in January 2009 to a high of 4,661 in November 2009. In 2010, the BDI increased from 3,140 in January 2010 to a high of 4,209 in May 2010 and subsequently decreased to a low of 1,700 in July 2010. Since D ecember 31, 2010, the BDI has further decreased to a low of 1,043 on February 4, 2011. The decline and volatility in charter rates has been due to various factors, including the lack of trade financing for purchases of commodities carried by sea, which resulted in a significant decline in cargo shipments, trade disruptions caused by natural disasters, and increased vessel deliveries, especially in the Capesize segment. In 2010, Chinese iron ore imports decreased by 1.4% compared to 2009 and coal imports rose by 31% in the same period. There is no certainty that the dry bulk charter market will experience any further recovery over the next several months and the market could decline from its current level. These circumstances, which result from the economic dislocation worldwide and the disruption of the credit markets, have had a number of adverse consequences for dry bulk shipping, including, among other things: • a decrease in available financing for vessels; • a sharp decline in charter rates, particularly for vessels employed in the spot market; • charterers seeking to renegotiate the rates for existing time charters; 3 • widespread loan covenant defaults in the dry bulk shipping industry due to the substantial decrease in vessel values; and • declaration of bankruptcy by some operators, charterers and shipowners. The degree of charter hire rate volatility among different types of dry bulk carriers has varied widely. If we enter into a charter when charter hire rates are low, our revenues and earnings will be adversely affected. In addition, a decline in charter hire rates likely will cause the value of the vessels that we own, to decline and we may not be able to successfully charter our vessels in the future at rates sufficient to allow us to operate our business profitably or meet our obligations. Because the factors affecting the supply and demand for dry bulk carriers are outside of our control and are unpredictable, the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in dry bulk shipping market conditions are also unpredictable. Factors that influence demand for seaborne transportation of cargo include: • demand for and production of dry bulk products; • the distance cargo is to be moved by sea; • global and regional economic and political conditions; • environmental and other regulatory developments; and • changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances over which cargo is transported due to geographic changes in where commodities are produced and cargoes are used. The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include: • the number of new vessel deliveries; • the scrapping rate of older vessels; • vessel casualties; • the price of steel; • the number of vessels that are out of service; • changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful life of vessels; and • port or canal congestion. We anticipate that the future demand for our vessels will be dependent upon continued economic growth in the world's economies, including China and India, seasonal and regional changes in demand, changes in the capacity of the world's dry bulk carrier fleet and the sources and supply of cargo to be transported by sea. If the global vessel capacity increases in the dry bulk shipping market, but the demand for vessel capacity in this market does not increase or increases at a slower rate, the charter rates could materially decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 4 The market values of our vessels may decrease, which could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow or trigger certain financial covenants under our current or future credit facilities, and we may incur a loss if we sell vessels following a decline in their market value. The fair market values of our vessels are related to prevailing freight charter rates. While the fair market value of vessels and the freight charter market have a very close relationship as the charter market moves from trough to peak, the time lag between the effect of charter rates on market values of ships can vary. A decrease in the market value of our vessels would require us to raise additional capital in order to remain compliant with our loan covenants and loan covenant waiver agreements, and could result in the loss of our vessels and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. The fair market value of our vessels may increase and decrease depending on a number of factors including: • prevailing level of charter rates; • general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry; • types and sizes of vessels; • supply and demand for vessels; • other modes of transportation; • cost of newbuildings; • governmental and other regulations; and • technological advances. In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. If the fair market value of our vessels declines, we may not be in compliance with certain provisions of our credit facilities. If we are not able to remedy a non-compliance or obtain waivers, our lenders could require us to post additional collateral, enhance our equity and liquidity, increase our interest payments or pay down our indebtedness to a level where we are in compliance with our loan covenants, sell vessels from our fleet, or they could accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on their collateral, which would impair our ability to continue to conduct our business. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing. In addition, if we sell one or more of our vessels at a time when vessel prices have fal len and before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our consolidated financial statements, the sale may be less than the vessel's carrying value on our consolidated financial statements, resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings. Furthermore, if vessel values fall significantly we may have to record an impairment adjustment in our financial statements which could adversely affect our financial results. If we are not in compliance with these covenants and we are unable to obtain waivers, we will not be able to pay dividends in the future until the covenant defaults are cured or we obtain waivers. This may limit our ability to continue to conduct our operations, pay dividends to you, finance our future operations, make acquisitions or pursue business opportunities. An economic slowdown in the Asia Pacific region could exacerbate the effect of recent slowdowns in the economies of the United States and the European Union and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect that a significant number of the port calls made by our vessels will continue to involve the loading or discharging of dry bulk commodities in ports in the Asia Pacific region. As a result, any negative changes in economic conditions in any Asia Pacific country, particularly in China, Japan and, to some extent, India, may exacerbate the effect of recent slowdowns in the economies of the United States and the European Union and may 5 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as our future prospects. In recent years, China and India have had two of the world's fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product, which has had a significant impact on shipping demand. It is possible that China and other countries in the Asia Pacific region will continue to experience slower economic growth in the near future. Moreover, the current economic slowdown in the economies of the United States, the European Union and other Asian countries may further adversely affect economic growth in China, India and elsewhere. Our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our future prospects, will likely be adversely affected by a further economic downturn in any of these countries. An oversupply of dry bulk carrier capacity may lead to reductions in charter rates and our profitability. The market supply of dry bulk carriers has been increasing, and the number of dry bulk carriers on order is near historic highs. As of December 2010, newbuilding orders had been placed in dwt for an aggregate of more than 51.9% of the existing global dry bulk fleet, with the most deliveries expected during the next two years. An over-supply of dry bulk carrier capacity may result in a reduction of charter hire rates. If such a reduction occurs, upon the expiration or termination of our vessels' current charters, we may only be able to re-charter our vessels at reduced or unprofitable rates or we may not be able to charter these vessels at all. Changes in the economic and political environment in China and policies adopted by the government to regulate its economy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, in such respects as structure, government involvement, level of development, growth rate, capital reinvestment, allocation of resources, rate of inflation and balance of payments position. Prior to 1978, the Chinese economy was a planned economy. Since 1978, increasing emphasis has been placed on the utilization of market forces in the development of the Chinese economy. Annual and five-year state plans are adopted by the Chinese government in connection with the development of the economy. Although state-owned enterprises still account for a substantial portion of the Chinese industrial output, in general, the Chinese government is reducing the level of direct control that it exercises over the economy through state plans and other measures. There is an increasing level of freedom and autonomy in areas such as allocation of resources, production, pricing and management and a gradual shift in emphasis to a "market economy" and enterprise reform. Limited price reforms were undertaken with the result that prices for certain commodities are principally determined by market forces. Many of the reforms are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision, change or abolition based upon the outcome of such experiments. If the Chinese government does not continue to pursue a policy of economic reform, the level of imports to and exports from China could be adversely affected by changes to these economic reforms by the Chinese government, as well as by changes in political, economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws, regulations or export and import restrictions, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Risks involved with operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation, which would adversely affect our revenues and expenses. The operation of an ocean-going vessel carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of: • crew strikes and/or boycotts; • marine disaster; • piracy; • environmental accidents; • cargo and property losses or damage; and 6 • business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries or adverse weather conditions. Any of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues. Continued disruptions in world financial markets and the resulting governmental action in the United States and in other parts of the world could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain financing, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could cause the market price of our common shares and warrants to further decline. The United States and other parts of the world have exhibited weak economic conditions and have been in a recession. For example, the credit markets in the United States have experienced significant contraction, de-leveraging and reduced liquidity, and the United States federal government and state governments have implemented and are considering a broad variety of governmental action and/or new regulation of the financial markets. Securities and futures markets and the credit markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and other requirements. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, other regulators, self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies, and may effect changes in law or interpretations of existing laws. Recently, a number of financial institutions have experienced serious financial difficulties and, in some cases, have entered bankruptcy proceedings or are in regulatory enforcement actions. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the credit markets in the United States and the rest of the world has resulted in reduced access to credit worldwide. As of December 31, 2010, we have total outstanding indebtedness of $399.5 million. We face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, and instability in certain securities markets, among other factors. Major market disruptions and the current adverse changes in market conditions and regulatory climate in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our business or impair our ability to borrow amounts under our credit facilities or any future financial arrangements. These recent and developing economic and governmental factors, together with the concurrent decline in charter rates and vessel values, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and have caused the price of our common stock and warrants on the NASDAQ Global Market to decline and could cause the price of our common stock and warrants to decline further. We will require substantial additional financing to fund the acquisition of additional vessels and to implement our business plans. We cannot be certain that sufficient financing will be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we cannot raise the financing we need in a timely manner and on acceptable terms, we may not be able to acquire the vessels necessary to implement our business plans and consequently you may lose some or all of your investment in us. If we acquire additional dry bulk carriers and those vessels are not delivered on time or are delivered with significant defects, our earnings and financial condition could suffer. We expect to acquire additional vessels in the future. A delay in the delivery of any of these vessels to us or the failure of the contract counterparty to deliver a vessel at all could cause us to breach our obligations under a related time charter and could adversely affect our earnings, our financial condition and the amount of dividends, if any, that we pay in the future. The delivery of these vessels could be delayed or certain events may arise which could result in us not taking delivery of a vessel, such as a total loss of a vessel, a constructive loss of a vessel, or substantial damage to a vessel prior to delivery. In addition, the delivery of any of these vessels with substantial defects could have similar consequences. Rising fuel prices may adversely affect our profits. The cost of fuel is a significant factor in negotiating charter rates. As a result, an increase in the price of fuel beyond our expectations may adversely affect our profitability. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geo-political developments, supply and demand for oil, actions by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war 7 and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns and regulations. Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which may reduce the profitability and competitiveness of our business versus other forms of transportation, such as truck or rail. Upon redelivery of vessels at the end of a period time or trip time charter, we may be obligated to repurchase bunkers on board at prevailing market prices, which could be materially higher than fuel prices at the inception of the charter period. In addition, although we rarely deploy our vessels on voyage charters, fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense that we would incur with respect to vessels operating on voyage charter. We may become dependent on spot charters in the volatile shipping markets which may have an adverse impact on stable cash flows and revenues. We may employ one or more of our vessels on spot charters, including when time charters on one or more of our vessels expires. The spot charter market is highly competitive and rates within this market are subject to volatile fluctuations, while longer-term period time charters provide income at predetermined rates over more extended periods of time. If we decide to spot charter our vessels, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in keeping all our vessels fully employed in these short-term markets or that future spot rates will be sufficient to enable our vessels to be operated profitably. A significant decrease in charter rates could affect the value of our fleet and could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows with the result that our ability to pay debt service to our lenders could be impaired. Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect our operating results and ability to service our debt or pay dividends in the future. We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, in charter hire rates. To the extent we operate vessels in the spot market, this seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results. The dry bulk carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and other raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. As a result, our revenues may be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September 30, and, conversely, our revenues may be stronger in fiscal quarters ended December 31 and March 31. While this seasona lity will not affect our operating results as long as our fleet is employed on period time charters, if our vessels are employed in the spot market in the future, seasonality may materially affect our operating results. Our vessels may call on ports located in countries that are subject to sanctions or embargoes imposed by the United States government, which could negatively affect the trading price of our shares of common stock and our warrants. From time to time, on charterers' instructions, our vessels may call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions or embargoes imposed by the United States government and in countries identified by the United States government as state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or strengthened over time. The United States government has recently imposed sanctions with respect to Libya and expanded existing sanctions with respect to Iran. On February 25, 2011, an executive order titled Blocking Property and Prohibiting Certain Transactions Related to Libya, or the Libya Executive Order, was issued. The Libya Executive Order prohibits U.S. persons from making or receiving contributions or provisions of funds, goods or services to or from certain entities and individuals whose property or interests in property are blocked by the Libya Executive Order. Entities and individuals with whom such transactions are specifically prohibited include, but are not limited to, certain members of the Qadafi family, the Libyan government (including its senior officials, agencies, instrumentalities and controlled entities) and the Central Bank of Libya. On July 1, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010, or CISADA. CISADA applies to both U.S. and non-U.S. persons, which includes our company. CISADA limits the ability of companies and persons to engage in investments and transactions that could directly and significantly contribute to Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources, import refined petroleum products, or facilitate the maintenance or expansion of Iran's domestic production of refined petroleum products. 8 Although we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, and intend to maintain such compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines or other penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in our company. Additionally, some investors may decide to divest their interest, or not to invest, in our company simply because we do business with companies that do business in sanctioned countries. Moreover, our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not involve us or our vessels, a nd those violations could in turn negatively affect our reputation. Investor perception of the value of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries. We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could require significant expenditures and affect our cash flows and net income. Our business and the operation of our vessels are materially affected by government regulation in the form of international conventions, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the vessels operate, as well as in the country or countries of their registration, including those governing oil spills, discharges to air and water, ballast water management, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, to which we refer as OPA, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (as from time to time amended), generally referred to as the Bunker Convention, the IMO International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution f rom Ships of 1973 (as from time to time amended), generally referred to as MARPOL, the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (as from time to time amended), generally referred to as SOLAS, the IMO International Convention on Load Lines of 1966 (as from time to time amended) and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, to which we refer as the MTSA. We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions including greenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. Furthermore, the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon and the subsequent release of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or other events, may result in further regula tion of the shipping industry, and modifications to statutory liability schemes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our available cash. Because such conventions, laws and regulations are often revised, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with such conventions, laws and regulations or the impact thereof on the resale price or useful life of our vessels. Additional conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business and which may materially adversely affect our operations. We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. We currently maintain, for each of our vessels, pollution liability coverage insurance of $1.0 billion per incident. If the damages from a catastrophic spill exceeded our insurance coverage, it would severely hurt us. Increased inspection procedures, tighter import and export controls and survey requirements could increase costs and disrupt our business. International shipping is subject to security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin, destination and trans-shipment points. Since the events of September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security. For example, on November 25, 2002, the MTSA came into effect. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the U.S. Coast Guard issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. These security procedures can result in delays in the loading, offloading or trans-shipment and the 9 levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against exporters or importers and, in some cases, carriers. Future changes to the existing security procedures may be implemented that could affect the tanker sector. These changes have the potential to impose additional financial and legal obligations on carriers and, in certain cases, to render the shipment of certain types of goods uneconomical or impractical. These additional costs could reduce the volume of goods shipped, resulting in a decreased demand for vessels and have a negative effect on our business, revenues and customer relations. Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have recently increased in frequency, which could adversely affect our business. Acts of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea and in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, the frequency of piracy incidents increased significantly, particularly in the Gulf of Aden, with dry bulk vessels and tankers particularly vulnerable to such attacks. For example, in November 2008, the Sirius Star, a tanker vessel not affiliated with us, was captured by pirates in the Indian Ocean while carrying crude oil estimated to be worth $100.0 million and was released in January 2009 upon a ransom payment of $3.0 million. In February 2009, the Saldanha, a vessel not affiliated with us, was seized by pirates while transporting coal through the Gulf of Aden and, in April 2009, the Maersk Alabama, a 17,000-ton container ship not affiliated with us, was seized by Somali pirates. Both of these ships were later released. If these piracy attacks result in regions (in which our vessels are deployed) being characterized by insurers as "war risk" zones, as the Gulf of Aden temporarily was in May 2008, or Joint War Committee (JWC) "war and strikes" listed areas, premiums payable for such insurance coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. Crew costs, including those due to employing onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. In addition, while we believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not "on-hire" for a cer tain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim that we would dispute. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government recently imposed legislation concerning the deteriorating situation in Somalia, including acts of piracy off the coast of Somalia. On April 13, 2010, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order, which we refer to as the Order, prohibiting, among other things, the payment of monies to or for the benefit of individuals and entities on the list of Specially Designated Nationals, or SDNs, published by U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Certain individuals associated with piracy off the coast of Somalia are currently designated persons under the SDN list. The Order is applicable only to payments by U.S. persons and not by foreign entities such as Seanergy. Notwithstanding this fact, it is possible that the Order, and the regulations promulgated therefrom, may affect foreign private issuers to the extent that such foreign private issuers provide monies, such as ransom payments to secure the release of crews and ships in the event of detention hijackings, to any SDN for which they seek reimbursement from a U.S. insurance carrier. While additional regulations relating to the Order may be promulgated by the U.S. government in the future, we cannot predict what effect these regulations may have on our operations. World events could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist attacks such as those in New York on September 11, 2001, in Spain on March 11, 2004, in London on July 7, 2005 and in Mumbai in 2008 and the continuing response of the United States to these attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere, continues to cause uncertainty in the world's financial markets and may affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The continuing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, min ing of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions 10 such as the South China Sea. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs. Terrorist attacks on vessels, such as the October 2002 attack on the Limburg, a vessel not related to us, may in the future also negatively affect our operations and financial condition and directly impact our vessels or our customers. Future terrorist attacks could result in increased volatility of the financial markets in the United States and globally and may impact the economic recession in the United States and other countries. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and costs. The operation of dry bulk carriers has particular operational risks which could affect our earnings and cash flow. The operation of certain vessel types, such as dry bulk carriers, has certain particular risks. With a dry bulk carrier, the cargo itself and its interaction with the vessel can be an operational risk. By their nature, dry bulk cargoes are often heavy, dense, easily shifted, and react badly to water exposure. In addition, dry bulk carriers are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold) and small bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the vessel. Vessels damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to breach while at sea. Hull breaches in dry bulk carriers may lead to the flooding of the vessels' holds. If a dry bulk carrier suffers flooding in its forward holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogg ed that its pressure may buckle the vessel's bulkheads leading to the loss of a vessel. If we are unable to adequately maintain our vessels, we may be unable to prevent these events. Any of these circumstances or events could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends in the future. If any of our vessels fails to maintain its class certification and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, or special survey, or if any scheduled dry-docks take longer or are more expensive than anticipated, this could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, or SOLAS. Our vessels are classed with one or more classification societies that are members of the International Association of Classification Societies. A vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, dry-dockings and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel's machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Our vessels are on special survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel is also required to be dry-docked every two to three years for inspection of the underwater parts of such vessels. These surveys and dry-dockings can be costly and can result in delays in returning a vessel to operation. The cost of our dry-docks in 2010 totaled approximately $8.3 million. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Requirements" for our anticipated dry-docks. div> If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, dry-docking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable. Any such inability to carry cargo or be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Because our seafaring employees are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements, failure of industry groups to renew those agreements may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our earnings. Our vessel-owning subsidiaries employ a large number of seafarers. All of the seafarers employed on the vessels in our fleet are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements that set basic standards. We cannot assure you that these agreements will prevent labor interruptions. Any labor interruptions could disrupt our operations and harm our financial performance. 11 Maritime claimants could arrest our vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow. Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arresting or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of funds to have the arrest lifted which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the "sister ship" theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any "associated" vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert "sister ship" liability against one of our vessels for claims relating to another of our vessels. Governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of earnings. A government could requisition for title or seize our vessels. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Also, a government could requisition our vessels for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Government requisition of one or more of our vessels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The shipping industry has inherent operational risks that may not be adequately covered by our insurance. We procure insurance for our fleet against risks commonly insured against by vessel owners and operators. Our current insurance includes hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance and protection and indemnity insurance (which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance). We may not be adequately insured against all risks or our insurers may not pay a particular claim. Even if our insurance coverage is adequate to cover our losses, we may not be able to timely obtain a replacement vessel in the event of a loss. Furthermore, in the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our fleet. We may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability. Our insurance policies also contain deductibles, limitations and exclusions which, although we believe are standard in the shipping industry, may nevertheless increase our costs. We have received waivers and/or amendments to our loan agreements waiving our compliance with certain covenants for certain periods of time. Our ability to conduct our business may be affected if we are unable to obtain waiver extensions or covenant modifications from our lenders and, in addition, any extensions of these waivers, if needed, could contain additional restrictions and might not be granted at all. Our various loan agreements require that we maintain certain financial and other covenants. Recently low dry bulk charter rates and dry bulk vessel values have affected our ability to comply with some of these covenants. We are in compliance with the market value to loan covenant of our Marfin Egnatia Bank S.A. of Greece, or Marfin, loan agreement only because we have received a waiver until January 3, 2012. As of December 31, 2010, we did not meet the minimum equity ratio requirement of our Citibank International Plc, or Citibank, loan agreement. We have requested and our lender has waived our minimum equity ratio requirement as of December 31, 2010 and has reduced the minimum equity ratio requirement from 0.3:1.0 to 0.175:1.0 for the period from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 (inclusive), pursuant to which we are in compliance with the new ratio. In addition, although we were in compliance as of December 31, 2010 with the terms of our United Overseas Bank Limited, or UOB, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, or HSBC, and DVB Bank AG, or DVB, loan agreements, we have also received waivers from HSBC and DVB, which waivers have expiration dates of December 31, 2012, and March 31, 2011, respectively. The relevant covenant in the UOB loan takes effect beginning as of December 31, 2012. If we are not in compliance with the terms of our loan agreements at the time the waivers expire, our lenders could require us to post additional collateral, enhance our equity and liquidity, compel us to withhold payment of dividends, increase our interest payments, pay down our indebtedness to a level where we are in compliance with our loan covenants, sell vessels in our fleet, or they could also accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on their collateral. The exercise of any of these remedies could materially adversely impair our ability to continue to conduct our business. 12 If conditions in the dry bulk charter market remain depressed or worsen, we may need to request additional extensions of these waivers. There can be no assurance that our lenders will provide such extensions, and their willingness to provide any such extensions may be limited by their financial condition, business strategy and outlook for the shipping industry at the time of any such request, all of which are outside of our control. If we require extensions to the waivers and are unable to obtain them, as described above, we would be in default under our various loan agreements, and your investment in our shares could lose most or all of its value. In addition, as a result of these waivers, our lenders imposed operating and financial restrictions on us. If we need to extend these waivers, our lenders may impose additional restrictions. In addition to the above restrictions, our lenders may require the payment of additional fees, require prepayment of a portion of our indebtedness to them, accelerate the amortization schedule for our indebtedness, and increase the interest rates they charge us on our outstanding indebtedness. These potential restrictions and requirements may limit our ability to pay dividends to you, finance our future operations, make acquisitions or pursue business opportunities. Furthermore, our Marfin loan agreement contains a cross-default provision that may be triggered by a default under one of our other loan agreements. A cross-default provision means that a default on one loan would result in a default on the other loan. Because of the presence of cross default provisions in our Marfin loan agreement, the refusal of any one lender to grant or extend a waiver could result in our indebtedness under our Marfin loan agreement being accelerated even if our other lenders have waived covenant defaults under the respective loan agreements. If our indebtedness under our Marfin loan agreement is accelerated, it may be very difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our vessels if Marfin forecloses its liens. Our debt financing contains restrictive covenants that may limit our liquidity and corporate activities. The Marfin, Citibank, UOB, HSBC and DVB loan agreements, and any future loan agreements we or our subsidiaries may execute, may impose operating and financial restrictions on us or our subsidiaries. These restrictions may, subject to certain exceptions, limit our or our subsidiaries' ability to: · incur additional indebtedness; · create liens on our or our subsidiaries' assets; · sell capital stock of our subsidiaries; · engage in any business other than the operation of the vessels; · pay dividends; · change or terminate the management of the vessels or terminate or materially amend the management agreement relating to each vessel; and · sell the vessels. The restrictions included in the Marfin loan agreement include minimum financial standards we must comply with including: · The ratio of total liabilities to total assets; · The ratio of total net debt owed to LTM (last twelve months) EBITDA; · The ratio of LTM EBITDA to net interest expense; · Cash to net debt; 13 · A security margin whereby the aggregate market value of the vessels and the value of any additional security is required to be at least 135% of the aggregate of the debt financing and any amount available for drawing under the revolving facility, less the aggregate amount of all deposits maintained. A waiver from Marfin has been received with respect to this clause. The financial ratios are required to be tested by us on a quarterly basis on a last-twelve-months basis. In addition to the minimum financial standards, under the terms of the Marfin loan agreement, we must also ensure that certain members of the Restis family of Greece, who are affiliates of our major shareholders, and the family of our former chairman Mr. George Koutsolioutsos (or companies affiliated with them) together own at all times an aggregate of at least 10% of our issued share capital. A violation of this covenant constitutes an event of default under our credit facility and would provide Marfin with various remedies. Under the UOB, DVB and HSBC loan agreements, no other person other than the Restis family or affiliated companies with the Restis family or Seanergy may become the beneficial owner of more than 30% of MCS's issued voting share capital. Furthermore, under the terms of the Citibank loan agreement, the Restis family or affiliated companies must be the ultimate beneficial owners of at least 50.1% of our issued voting share capital or, in certain circumstances, not less than 40% of our issued voting capital. If we are not in compliance with the terms of our loan agreements, our lenders could require us to post additional collateral, enhance our equity and liquidity, compel us to withhold payment of dividends, increase our interest payment, pay down our indebtedness, sell vessels in our fleet, or they could also accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on their collateral. The exercise of any of these remedies could materially adversely impair our ability to continue to conduct our business. Under the Citibank loan agreement, the BET subsidiaries are subject to operating and financial covenants that may affect BET's business. Furthermore, the BET subsidiaries must assure the lenders that the aggregate market value of the BET vessels is not less than 125% of the outstanding amount of the Citibank loan. If the market value of the vessels is less than this amount, the BET subsidiaries must prepay an amount that will result in the market value of the vessels meeting this requirement or offer additional security to the lenders, and a portion of the debt may be required to be classified as current. In addition, the Citibank supplemental agreement dated August 4, 2010 provides that BET must maintain a minimum amount of $7.5 million in cash in the BET account with Citibank. Under the Citibank supplemental agreement dated December 23, 2010, the applicable margin has been adjusted to 1.75% per annum. Lastly, the Citibank supplemental agreement dated March 31, 2011 provides (i) for a waiver of any breach or shortfall on the minimum equity ratio requirement as of December 31, 2010, (ii) for the temporary reduction of the minimum equity ratio requirement from 0.3:1.0 to 0.175:1.0 for the accounting period ending December 31, 2011 (inclusive) and (iii) for an adjustment of the applicable margin to 2% per annum for the period between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 (inclusive). Under the UOB, HSBC and DVB loan agreements, the MCS subsidiaries are subject to operating and financial covenants that may affect MCS's business. These restrictions may, subject to certain exceptions, limit the MCS subsidiaries' ability to engage in many of the activities listed above. Furthermore, the MCS subsidiaries must assure the lenders that the aggregate market value of the MCS vessels is not less than 133%, 125% and 100% of the outstanding amount of each of the UOB, HSBC and DVB loans, respectively. With respect to the DVB loan, the aggregate market value of the MCS vessel may not be less than 100% of the outstanding amount of the DVB loan provided that a certain prepayment is made by the Company, on or prior to March 31, 2011. After December 31, 2011, the aggregate market value of the MCS vessel may not be less than 133% of the outstanding amount of the DVB loan. Although we were in compliance with the terms as of December 31, 2010, we have received from each of HSBC and DVB waivers from compliance of these security requirements until December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011, respectively. With respect to the UOB loan, this covenant takes effect beginning as of December 31, 2012. If the market value of the vessels is less than this amount, the MCS subsidiaries must prepay an amount that will result in the market value of the vessels meeting this requirement or offer additional security to the lenders, and a portion of the debt may be required to be classified as current. Therefore, we may need to seek permission from our lenders in order to engage in some important corporate and commercial actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and a denial of permission may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Also, any further decline in vessel values may, absent any extensions of our current waivers, cause us, BET or MCS to fail to meet the market value covenants in the loan agreements and entitle the lenders to assert certain rights. Our current and any future lenders' interests may be different from our 14 interests, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such lenders' permission when needed. These potential restrictions and requirements may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future to you, finance our future operations, make acquisitions or pursue business opportunities. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our loan agreements may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions and other factors beyond our control. Any default under our loan agreements that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the lenders, could prevent us from paying dividends in the future. Any future loan agreement or amendment or debt instrument may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. The failure of our counterparties to meet their obligations under our time charter agreements could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business. Sixteen of our dry bulk vessels are currently employed under time charters, and the remaining four are currently employed on bareboat charters. The ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a time charter agreement with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the dry bulk shipping industry and the overall financial condition of the counterparties. In addition, in challenging market conditions, there have been reports of charterers, including some of our charterers, renegotiating their charters or defaulting on their obligations under charters and our customers may fail to pay charterhire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. The time charters on which we currently deploy sixteen of th e vessels in our fleet provide for charter rates that are above current market rates. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, it may be difficult to secure substitute employment for such vessel, and any new charter arrangements we secure in the spot market or on time charters would be at lower rates given currently decreased charter rate levels, particularly in the dry bulk carrier market. If our charterers fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate our charter agreements, we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends in the future and comply with covenants in our loan agreements. The derivative contracts we have entered into to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates could result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income. Through the BET and MCS acquisitions, we have three and three, respectively, interest rate swaps for purposes of managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates applicable to the BET and MCS loan facilities, which were advanced at a floating rate based on LIBOR. Our hedging strategies, however, may not be effective and we may incur substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations. Since our existing interest rate swaps do not, and future derivative contracts may not, qualify for treatment as hedges for accounting purposes, we recognize fluctuations in the fair value of such contracts in our income statement. In addition, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected to the extent we do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations under our financing arrangements. Any h edging activities we engage in may not effectively manage our interest rate exposure or have the desired impact on our financial conditions or results of operations. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately $8.6 million. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance indebtedness incurred under our credit facilities. For so long as we have outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities, we will have to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest of this indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts that are sufficient for these purposes. If we are not able to satisfy these obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans or sell our assets. The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers, any defaults by them, and the market value of our fleet, among other things, may materially affect our ability to obtain alternative financing. If we are not able to find alternative sources of financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affe cted. 15 As we expand our business, we will need to improve or expand our operating and financial systems and will need to recruit suitable employees and crew for our vessels. Our current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we implement our plan to expand the size of our fleet, and attempts by Safbulk, EST, M/S Fleet Ship Management Inc., or M/S Fleet, and Wallem Shipmanagement Ltd., or Wallem, to improve those systems may be ineffective. In addition, as we expand our fleet, we will have to rely on EST, M/S Fleet and Wallem to recruit additional seafarers and shoreside administrative and management personnel. EST, M/S Fleet and Wallem may not be able to continue to hire suitable employees or a sufficient number of employees as we expand our fleet. If EST's, M/S Fleet's or Wallem's unaffiliated crewing agents encounter business or financial difficulties, we may not be able to adequately staff our vessels. We may also have to increase our customer base to provide continued employment for most o f our new vessels. If we are unable to operate our financial system or increase our customer base as we expand our fleet, or if EST, M/S Fleet and Wallem are unable to operate our operating systems effectively or to recruit suitable employees in sufficient numbers, our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends in the future may be adversely affected. Unless we set aside reserves for vessel replacement, at the end of a vessel's useful life, our revenue will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flows and income. As of December 31, 2010, the vessels in our current fleet had an average age of 13 years. Unless we maintain cash reserves for vessel replacement, we may be unable to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their useful lives. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 30 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. Our cash flows and income are dependent on the revenues we earn by chartering our vessels to customers. If we are unable to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their useful lives, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Any reserves set aside for vessel replacement would not be available for other cash needs or dividends. The aging of our fleet may result in increased operating costs in the future, which could adversely affect our earnings. In general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. As of December 31, 2010, the average age of the vessels in our current fleet was 13 years. As our vessels age, they may become less fuel efficient and more costly to maintain and will not be as advanced as more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in design and engine technology. Rates for cargo insurance, paid by charterers, also increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. Governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may require expenditures for alterations, or the addition of new equipment, to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage. As our vessels age, market conditions may not justify t hose expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. In addition, charterers actively discriminate against hiring older vessels. For example, Rightship, the ship vetting service founded by Rio Tinto and BHP-Billiton which has become the major vetting service in the dry bulk shipping industry, ranks the suitability of vessels based on a scale of one to five stars. Most major carriers will not charter a vessel that Rightship has vetted with fewer than three stars. Rightship automatically downgrades any vessel over 18 years of age to two stars, which significantly decreases its chances of entering into a charter. Therefore, as our vessels approach and exceed 18 years of age, we may not be able to operate these vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. Our vessels may suffer damage and we may face unexpected drydocking costs, which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition. If our vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility. The costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. The loss of earnings while our vessels are being repaired and repositioned, as well as the actual cost of these repairs, would decrease our earnings and reduce the amount of dividends in the future. We may not have insurance that is sufficient to cover all or any of these costs or losses and may have to pay drydocking costs not covered by our insurance. 16 Purchasing and operating second hand vessels may result in increased operating costs and vessel off-hire, which could adversely affect our earnings. We have inspected the second hand vessels that we acquired in our initial business combination and in the acquisitions of BET and MCS and considered the age and condition of the vessels in budgeting for operating, insurance and maintenance costs. If we acquire additional second hand vessels in the future, we may encounter higher operating and maintenance costs due to the age and condition of those additional vessels. However, our inspection of second hand vessels prior to purchase does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition and cost of any required or anticipated repairs that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. A second hand vessel may have conditions or defects that we were not aware of when we bought the vessel and which may require us to incur costly repairs to the vessel. These repairs may require us to put a vessel into drydock which would reduce our fleet utilization. Furthermore, we usually do not receive the benefit of warranties on second hand vessels. In general, the costs to maintain a dry bulk carrier in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. The average age of our fleet is approximately 13 years, out of the expected useful life of 30 years. Older vessels, however, are typically less fuel-efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed dry bulk carriers due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. Governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may require expenditures for alterations, or the addition of new equipment, to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage. As our vessels age, market conditions may not justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. We are exposed to U.S. Dollar and foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations that could harm our reported revenue and results of operations. We generate all of our revenues and incur all of our operating expenses in U.S. Dollars, but we currently incur the majority of our general and administrative expenses in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro. Because such portion of our expenses is incurred in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, our expenses may from time to time increase relative to our revenues as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, which could affect the amount of net income that we report in future periods. We may use financial derivatives to operationally hedge some of our currency exposure. Our use of financial derivatives involves certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedged position could exceed the nominal amount invested in the instrument and the risk that the co unterparty to the derivative transaction may be unable or unwilling to satisfy its contractual obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our results. If the recent volatility in LIBOR continues, it could affect our profitability, earnings and cash flow. LIBOR has recently been volatile, with the spread between LIBOR and the prime lending rate widening significantly at times. These conditions are the result of the recent disruptions in the international credit markets. Because the interest rates borne by our outstanding indebtedness fluctuate with changes in LIBOR, if this volatility were to continue, it would affect the amount of interest payable on our debt, which in turn, could have an adverse effect on our profitability, earnings and cash flow. Furthermore, interest in most loan agreements in our industry has been based on published LIBOR rates. Recently, however, lenders have insisted on provisions that entitle the lenders, in their discretion, to replace published LIBOR as the base for the interest calculation with their cost-of-funds rate. If we are required to agree to such a provision in future loan agreements, our lending costs could increase significantly, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability, earnings and cash flow. 17 We are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy financial obligations or to pay dividends. We are a holding company and our subsidiaries, which are all wholly-owned by us either directly or indirectly, conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments depends on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, and the laws of Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, the Republic of Liberia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, where our vessel-owning subsidiaries are incorporated, which regulate the payment of dividends by companies. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, our board o f directors may not exercise its discretion to pay dividends in the future. In addition, the declaration and payment of dividends in the future will depend on the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of dividends. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends if the company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent upon payment of such dividend and dividends may be declared and paid out of our operating surplus; but in this case, there is no such surplus. Dividends may be declared or paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will also be subject to our satisfaction of certain financial covenants contained in our credit facilities and certain waivers related thereto. We may be unable to pay dividends in the anticipated amounts or at all. The value of our vessels has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate significantly, due in large part to the sharp decline in the world economy and the charter market. A significant decline in vessel values could result in losses when we sell our vessels or could result in a requirement that we write down their carrying value, which would adversely affect our earnings. In addition, a decline in vessel values could adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital and would likely cause us to violate certain covenants in our loan agreements that relate to vessel value. The market value of our vessels can and have fluctuated significantly based on general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry and prevailing charter hire rates. Since the end of 2008, the market value of our vessels has dropped significantly due to, among other things, the substantial decline in charter rates. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.5 million on our vessels. No indication of impairment existed as of December 31, 2009 or through December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance as to how long charter rates and vessel values will remain at the current low levels or whether they will improve to any significant degree. Consequently we may have to record further impairments of our vessels. The market value of our vessels may increase or decrease in the future depending on the following factors: · economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry in general; · supply of dry bulk vessels, including newbuildings; · demand for dry bulk vessels; · scrap values · types, sizes and ages of vessels; · other modes of transportation; · competition from other shipping companies; · cost of newbuildings; · technological advances; 18 · new regulatory requirements from governments or self-regulated organizations; and · prevailing level of charter rates. Because the market value of our vessels may fluctuate significantly, we may incur losses when we sell vessels, which may adversely affect our earnings. In addition, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment, we test the carrying value of our vessels in our financial statements, based upon their earning capacity and remaining useful lives. Earning capacity is measured by the vessels' expected earnings under their charters. If we determine that our vessels' carrying values should be reduced, we would recognize an impairment charge on our financial statements that would result in a potentially significant charge against our earnings and a reduction in our shareholders' equity. Such impairment adjustment could also hinder our ability to raise capital. If for any reason we sell our vessels at a time when pr ices have fallen, the sale proceeds may be less than that vessel's carrying amount on our financial statements, and we would incur a loss and a reduction in earnings. Finally, a decline in vessel values would likely cause us to violate certain covenants in our loan agreement that require vessel values to equal or exceed a stated percentage of the amount of our loans. Such violations could result in our default under our loan agreements. If we fail to manage our growth properly, we may not be able to expand our fleet further if we desire to do so, adversely affecting our overall financial position. We may continue to expand our fleet in the future if desirable opportunities arise. Our further growth will depend on: · locating and acquiring suitable vessels at competitive prices; · identifying and consummating acquisitions or joint ventures; · integrating any acquired vessels successfully with our existing operations; · enhancing our customer base; · managing our expansion; and · obtaining required financing, which could include debt, equity or combinations thereof. Growing any business by acquisition presents numerous risks such as undisclosed liabilities and obligations, difficulty experienced in obtaining additional qualified personnel, managing relationships with customers and suppliers, integrating newly acquired operations into existing infrastructures, identifying new and profitable charter opportunities for vessels, and complying with new loan covenants. We have not identified further expansion opportunities at this time, and the nature and timing of any such expansion is uncertain. We may not be successful in growing further and may incur significant expenses and losses. We face strong competition, and we may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources, which may adversely affect our results of operations. We obtain charters for our vessels in highly competitive markets in which our market share is insufficient to enforce any degree of pricing discipline. Although we believe that no single competitor has a dominant position in the markets in which we compete, we are aware that certain competitors may be able to devote greater financial and other resources to their activities than we can, resulting in a significant competitive threat to us. Competition for the transportation of dry bulk cargoes can be intense and depends on price, customer relationships, operating expertise, professional reputation and size, location age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its managers to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater resources could operate larger fleets through consolidations or acquisi tions that may be able to offer better prices and fleets. We cannot give assurances that we will continue to compete successfully with our competitors or that these factors will not erode our competitive position in the future. 19 Substantial debt levels could limit our flexibility to obtain additional financing and pursue other business opportunities. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding indebtedness of $399.5 million and we expect to incur additional indebtedness as we further grow our fleet as market conditions warrant. This level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following: · our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may be unavailable on favorable terms; · we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash from operations to make principal and interest payments on our debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and any future dividends to our shareholders; · our debt level could make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and · our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, as well as the level of future interest rates applicable to our outstanding indebtedness. If our operating income is not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions, such as reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, a lack of liquidity in the debt and equity markets could hinder our abili ty to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on favorable terms in the future. Credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our revolving credit facility or incur additional debt. The credit markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruption, which has limited credit capacity for certain issuers, and lenders have requested shorter terms and lower loan to value ratios. The market for new debt financing is extremely limited and in some cases not available at all. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, we may not be able to refinance our existing debt, draw upon our revolving credit facility or incur additional debt, which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund planned expansion. For example, our existing term loan and revolving credit facilities from Marfin are tied to the market value of the vessels whereby the aggregate market values of the vessels and the value of any additional security should be at least 135% of the aggregate of the debt financing and any amount available for drawing under the revolving facility less the aggregate amount of all deposits maintained. If the percentage is below 135%, then a prepayment of the loans may be required or additional security may be requested. On September 9, 2009, November 13, 2009 and June 2, 2010 we executed addenda no. 1, no. 2 and no. 3, respectively, to the loan agreement with Marfin and obtained a waiver of this loan covenant through January 3, 2012. In connection with the amendment and waiver dated June 2, 2010, Marfin made certain changes to our loan agreement including increasing the interest payable during the waiver period from USD LIBOR plus 3.00% to USD LIBOR plus 3.50% in respect of the term loan and from USD LIBOR plus 3.50% to USD LIBOR plus 4.00% in respect of the revolving facility, accelerating the due dates of certain of our principal installments and limiting our ability to pay divi dends without their prior consent. The Citibank restated loan agreement as amended by the supplemental agreement dated September 30, 2009 contains a similar covenant. If the market value of the BET vessels is less than 125% of the outstanding amount of the Citibank loan, the BET subsidiaries must prepay an amount that will result in the market value of the vessels meeting this requirement or offer additional security to the lenders. The Citibank supplemental agreement dated August 4, 2010 provides that BET must maintain a minimum amount of $7.5 million in cash in the BET account with Citibank and, under the Citibank supplemental agreement dated December 23, 2010, the applicable margin has been adjusted to 1.75% per annum. The Citibank supplemental agreement dated March 31, 2011 provides (i) for a waiver of any breach or shortfall in the minimum equity ratio requirement as of December 31, 2010, (ii) for the temp orary reduction of the minimum equity ratio requirement from 0.3:1.0 to 0.175:1.00 for the accounting period ending December 31, 2011 and (iii) for an adjustment of the applicable margin to 2% for the period between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011. Our MCS loan agreements include covenants, among others, that require the MCS borrowers to maintain vessel insurance for an aggregate amount equal to the greater of the vessels' aggregate market value or an amount equal to 133%, 125% and 100% of the outstanding amount under each of the UOB, HSBC and DVB loans as described above. The MCS borrowers have received from each of DVB and HSBC waivers from compliance of these security requirements until March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, respectively. The relevant covenant in the UOB loan takes effect beginning as of December 31, 2012. On the MCS loan facility with DVB the applicable margin following the supplemental agreement dated May 20, 2010 is USD LIBOR plus 2.10% per annum on the senior loan and USD LIBOR plus 4.90% per annum on the junior loan. On the MCS loan facility with HSBC following a supplemental agreement dated May 21, 2010, the applicable margin to the later of July 21, 2011 and the date of compliance with the security requirement covenant is USD LIBOR 20 plus 3.25% per annum and thereafter is USD LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum unless there is a breach of the compliance of the security requirement or there is an event of default under the loan agreement. With respect to the MCS loan facility with UOB, and following a supplemental agreement dated May 24, 2010, the applicable margin prior to the voluntary prepayment was USD LIBOR plus (i) 1.40% per annum if the loan-to-value ratio was equal to or greater than 70%, (ii) 1.25% if the loan-to-value ratio was equal to or greater than 60% but less than 70%, or (iii) 1.10% if the loan-to-value ratio was less than 60%. The applicable margin following the voluntary prepayment is USD LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum in relation to the senior loan and USD LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum in relation to the subordinated loan. Hence, we may need to seek permission from our lenders in order to make further use of our Marfin revolving credit facility or avoid prepayment obligations under our Marfin, Citibank, UOB, HSBC or DVB loan agreements, depending on the aggregate market value of our vessels. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms, or at all. Rising crew costs may adversely affect our profits. Crew costs are a significant expense for us under our charters. Recently, the limited supply of and increased demand for well-qualified crew, due to the increase in the size of the global shipping fleet, has created upward pressure on crewing costs, which we generally bear under our period time and spot charters. Increases in crew costs may adversely affect our profitability. When our charters expire, we may not be able to replace such charters promptly or with profitable charters, which may adversely affect our earnings. We will generally attempt to recharter our vessels at favorable rates with reputable charterers as our existing charters expire. If the dry bulk shipping market is in a period of depression when our vessels' charters expire, it is likely that we may be forced to re-charter them at substantially reduced rates, if we are able to re-charter them at all. If rates are significantly lower or if we are unable to recharter our vessels, our earnings may be adversely affected. Because we obtain some of our insurance through protection and indemnity associations, we may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also on the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations. We may be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our claim records but also on the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive insurance coverage for tort liability, including pollution-related liability. Our payment of these calls could result in significant expenses to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends in the future. 21 We may not be able to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees in the shipping industry, which may negatively affect the effectiveness of our management and our results of operations. Our success will depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of our management team. We currently have two executive officers, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, and one general counsel and a support staff. Our success will depend upon our ability to retain key members of our management team and the ability of our management to recruit and hire suitable employees. The loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. Difficulty in hiring and retaining personnel could adversely affect our results of operations. We may not have adequate insurance to compensate us if we lose our vessels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have procured hull and machinery insurance and protection and indemnity insurance, which include environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage and war risk insurance for our fleet. We do not expect to maintain for all of our vessels insurance against loss of hire, which covers business interruptions that result from the loss of use of a vessel. We may not be adequately insured against all risks. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our fleet in the future. The insurers may not pay particular claims. Our insurance policies may contain deductibles for which we will be responsible and limitations and exclusions which may increase our costs or lower our revenue. Moreover, insurers may default on claims they are required to pay. Furthermore, in the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance cover age at reasonable rates for our vessels. If our insurance is not enough to cover claims that may arise, the deficiency may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Although we intend to defend these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or the potential costs to resolve them may have a material adverse effect on us. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could result in fines, criminal penalties, and an adverse effect on our business. We may operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which is consistent and in full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We are subject, however, to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financi al condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. We depend on our commercial and technical managers to operate our business and our business could be harmed if they fail to perform their services satisfactorily. Pursuant to our management agreements, EST provides us with technical, general administrative and support services (including vessel maintenance, crewing, purchasing, shipyard supervision, insurance, assistance 22 with regulatory compliance, freight management, accounting related to vessels, provisions, bunkering and operation) and M/S Fleet and Wallem provide us with technical management services for certain of our vessels. Our operational success depends significantly upon EST's, M/S Fleet's and Wallem's satisfactory performance of these services. Our business would be harmed if EST, M/S Fleet or Wallem failed to perform these services satisfactorily. In addition, if the management agreement were to be terminated or if its terms were to be altered, our business could be adversely affected, as we may not be able to immediately replace such services, and even if replacement services were immediately available, the terms offered could be less favorable than those under our management agreement. Our ability to compete for and enter into new period time and spot charters and to expand our relationships with our existing charterers will depend largely on our relationship with our commercial manager, Safbulk, and its reputation and relationships in the shipping industry. If Safbulk suffers material damage to its reputation or relationships, it may harm our ability to: · renew existing charters upon their expiration; · obtain new charters; · obtain financing on commercially acceptable terms; · maintain satisfactory relationships with our charterers and suppliers; and · successfully execute our business strategies. If our ability to do any of the things described above is impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we may have rights against EST, M/S Fleet and Wallem if they default on their obligations to us, investors in us will have no recourse against them. Further, we will need to seek approval from our lenders to change our technical managers from EST, M/S Fleet or Wallem. Management fees are payable to our technical managers regardless of our profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pursuant to our management agreement with EST, M/S Fleet and Wallem, we pay a fee of EUR 436, $296 and $230, per day per vessel, respectively, for providing technical, support and administrative services. The management fees do not cover expenses such as voyage expenses, vessel operating expenses, maintenance expenses, crewing costs, insurance premiums, commissions and certain public company expenses such as directors and officers' liability insurance, legal and accounting fees and other similar third party expenses, which are reimbursed by us. The management fees are payable whether or not our vessels are employed, and regardless of our profitability, and we have no ability to require our technical managers to reduce the management fees if our profitability decreases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on each of EST and Safbulk for the technical management and commercial management of part of our fleet. We subcontract the technical management and commercial management of part of our fleet, including crewing, maintenance and repair, to each of EST and Safbulk, both affiliates of members of the Restis family. The loss of services of, or the failure to perform by, either of these entities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Although we may have rights against either of these entities if they default on their obligations to us, you will have no recourse directly against them. Further, we expect that we will need to seek approval from our lenders to change our manager from EST. 23 EST, Safbulk, M/S Fleet and Wallem are privately held companies and there is little or no publicly available information about them. The ability of EST, Safbulk, M/S Fleet and Wallem to continue providing services for our benefit will depend in part on their respective financial strength. Circumstances beyond our control could impair their financial strength, and because they are privately held, it is unlikely that information about their financial strength would become public unless any of these entities began to default on their respective obligations. As a result, our shareholders might have little advance warning of problems affecting EST, Safbulk, M/S Fleet and Wallem, even though these problems could have a material adverse effect on us. We outsource, and expect to continue to outsource, the technical management and commercial management of part of our fleet to companies that are affiliated with members of the Restis family, which may create conflicts of interest. We outsource, and expect to continue to outsource, the technical management and commercial management of part of our fleet to EST and Safbulk, companies that are affiliated with members of the Restis family. Companies affiliated with members of the Restis family own and may acquire vessels that compete with our fleet. Both EST and Safbulk have responsibilities and relationships to owners other than us which could create conflicts of interest between us, on the one hand, and EST or Safbulk, on the other hand. These conflicts may arise in connection with the chartering of the vessels in our fleet versus dry bulk carriers managed by other companies affiliated with members of the Restis family. There can be no assurance that they will resolve conflicts in our favor. Because South African Marine Corp., S.A. is the sole counterparty on the time charters for five of our vessels, the failure of this counterparty to meet its obligations could cause us to suffer losses, thereby decreasing our revenues, operating results and cash flows. All five BET vessels are chartered to South African Marine Corp., S.A., or SAMC, a company affiliated with members of the Restis family. Until we are able to fully implement our strategy of chartering vessels to unaffiliated charterers, we will continue to be dependent on performance by SAMC. Our charters may terminate earlier than the dates indicated in this annual report. Under our charter agreements, the events or occurrences that will cause a charter to terminate or give the charterer the option to terminate the charter generally include a total or constructive total loss of the related vessel, the requisition for hire of the related vessel or the failure of the related vessel to meet specified performance criteria. In addition, the ability of our charterer to perform its obligations under a charter will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control. These factors may include general economic conditions, the condition of the dry bulk shipping industry, the charter rates received for specific types of vessels, the ability of the charterer to obtain letters of credit from its customers and various operating expenses. It is our understanding that SAMC operates some of the vessels on period charters and some of the vessels in the spot market. The spot market is highly competitive and spot rates fluctuate significantly. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable than those on period time charters. Therefore, SAMC may be exposed to the risk of fluctuating spot dry bulk charter rates, which may have an adverse impact on its financial performance and its obligations. The cost and delays associated with the default by a charterer of a vessel may be considerable and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and our ability to pay dividends. The majority of the members of our shipping committee are appointees nominated by affiliates of members of the Restis family, which could create conflicts of interest detrimental to us. Our board of directors has created a shipping committee, which has been delegated exclusive authority to consider and vote upon all matters involving shipping and vessel finance, subject to certain limitations. Affiliates of members of the Restis family have the right to appoint two of the three members of the shipping committee and as a result such affiliates will effectively control all decisions with respect to our shipping operations that do not involve a transaction with a Restis affiliate. Mr. Dale Ploughman, Ms. Christina Anagnostara and Mr. Dimitris Panagiotopoulos currently serve on our shipping committee. Mr. Ploughman also will continue to serve as an officer and/or director of other entities affiliated with members of the Restis family that operate in the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry. The dual responsibilities in e xercising fiduciary duties to us and other entities in the shipping industry could create conflicts of interest. Although Mr. Ploughman intends to maintain as confidential all 24 information he learns from one company and not disclose it to the other entities for whom he serves; in certain instances this could be impossible given the respective roles with various companies. There can be no assurance that Mr. Ploughman would resolve any conflicts of interest in a manner beneficial to us. The Restis affiliate shareholders hold approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock. This may limit your ability to influence our actions. As of March 30, 2011, the Restis affiliate shareholders own approximately 75%, excluding shares issuable upon exercise of warrants, of our outstanding common stock (including 70,000 shares of common stock owned by Argonaut SPC, a fund whose investment manager is an affiliate of members of the Restis family), or approximately 61% of our outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis, assuming exercise of all outstanding warrants. Our major shareholders have the power to exert considerable influence over our actions and matters which require shareholder approval, which limits your ability to influence our actions. Furthermore, under the terms of the Citibank loan agreement, the Restis family or affiliated companies must be the ultimate beneficial owners of at least 50.1% of our issued voting share capital or, in certain circum stances, not less than 40% of our issued voting capital. Additionally, under the terms of the Marfin loan agreement, we must also ensure that members of the Restis family and the family of our former chairman Mr. George Koutsolioutsos (or companies affiliated with them) together own at all times an aggregate of at least 10% of our issued share capital. Under the UOB, DVB and HSBC loan agreements, no other person other than the Restis family or affiliated companies with the Restis family or Seanergy may become the beneficial owner of more than 30% of MCS's issued voting share capital. The market price of our common stock has been and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuations. The market price of our common stock has been and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Among the factors that have in the past and could in the future affect our stock price are: · quarterly variations in our results of operations; · our lenders' willingness to extend our loan covenant waivers, if necessary; · changes in market valuations of similar companies and stock market price and volume fluctuations generally; · changes in earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts; · speculation in the press or investment community about our business or the shipping industry generally; · strategic actions by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings; · the thin trading market for our common stock, which makes it somewhat illiquid; · the current ineligibility of our common stock to be the subject of margin loans because of its low current market price; · regulatory developments; · additions or departures of key personnel; · general market conditions; and · domestic and international economic, market and currency factors unrelated to our performance. 25 The stock markets in general, and the markets for dry bulk shipping and shipping stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Our common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets. Our common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. Our ability to retain our listing is contingent upon compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements. The listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Market provide, among other things, that a company may be delisted if the bid price of its stock drops below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days. On January 28, 2011, we were notified by NASDAQ that we were no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing bid price of our common stock for 30 consecutive business days, from December 14, 2010 to January 26, 2011, had been below the minimum $1.00 per share bid price requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market. This notification has no effect on the listing of the Company's common stock at this time, and the applicable grace period to regain compliance is 180 calendar days, expiring on July 27, 2011. We will regain compliance if, at any time during such grace period, the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. However, as of March 30, 2011, the closing bid price of our common stock had not reached $1.00 per share f or any business day since our receipt of the bid price deficiency notice from NASDAQ. We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock between now and July 27, 2011. However, if the closing bid price of our common stock does not reach $1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days, our common stock listing may be moved to the NASDAQ Capital Market, which is a lower tier market, or our common stock may be delisted and traded on the over-the-counter bulletin board network. Moving our listing to the NASDAQ Capital Market could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and the delisting of our common stock would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and could significantly negatively affect the value of our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could further depress our stock price and materially adversely affect our ability to raise fu rther capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Delisting from NASDAQ could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. Our board of directors has suspended the payment of cash dividends as a result of certain restrictions in waivers we received from Marfin relating to our loan covenants and prevailing market conditions in the international shipping industry. Until such market conditions improve, it is unlikely that we will reinstate the payment of dividends. In light of a lower freight environment and a highly challenging financing environment that has resulted in a substantial decline in the international shipping industry, our board of directors, beginning on February 4, 2009, suspended the cash dividend on our common stock. Our dividend policy will be assessed by our board of directors from time to time; however, it is unlikely that we will reinstate the payment of dividends until market conditions improve. Further, the waiver we have received from Marfin relating to our loan covenant restricts our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, there can be no assurances that, if we were to determine to resume paying cash dividends, Marfin would provide any required consent. We are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate law, which may negatively affect the ability of shareholders to protect their interests. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws and by the BCA. The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Republic of the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain U.S. jurisdictions. Shareholder rights may differ as well. While the BCA does specifically incorporate the non-statutory law, or judicial case la w, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction. 26 It may be difficult to serve us with legal process or enforce judgments against us, our directors or our management. We are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and all of our assets are, and will be, located outside of the United States. Our business is operated primarily from our offices in Athens, Greece. In addition, our directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of these non-residents are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us, or against these individuals in the United States if you believe that your rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, you may have difficulty enforcing, both within and outside of the United States, judgments you may obtain in the United States courts against us or t hese persons in any action, including actions based upon the civil liability provisions of United States federal or state securities laws. There is also substantial doubt that the courts of the Republic of the Marshall Islands or Greece would enter judgments in original actions brought in those courts predicated on United States federal or state securities laws. Although you may bring an original action against us or our affiliates in the courts of the Marshall Islands based on U.S. laws, and the courts of the Marshall Islands may impose civil liability, including monetary damages, against us, or our affiliates for a cause of action arising under Marshall Islands laws, it may impracticable for you to do so given the geographic location of the Marshall Islands. For more information regarding the relevant laws of the Marshall Islands, please read "Enforceability of Civil Liabilities." Anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it difficult for shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Several provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year, preventing them from changing the composition of our management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions include those that: · authorize our board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock without shareholder approval; · provide for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; · require a super-majority vote in order to amend the provisions regarding our classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; · permit the removal of any director from office at any time, with or without cause, at the request of the shareholder group entitled to designate such director; · allow vacancies on the board of directors to be filled by the shareholder group entitled to name the director whose resignation or removal led to the occurrence of the vacancy; and · prevent our board of directors from dissolving the shipping committee or altering the duties or composition of the shipping committee without an affirmative vote of not less than 80% of the board of directors. 27 These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of shareholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium. We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of our common stock. A foreign corporation will be treated as a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of "passive income" or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of "passive income." For purposes of these tests, "passive income" includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute "passive income." U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantag eous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC. We should not be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. Based upon our operations as described herein, our income from time charters should not be treated as passive income for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. Accordingly, our income from our time chartering activities should not constitute "passive income," and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income should not constitute passive assets. There is substantial legal authority supporting this position consisting of case law and U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, it should be noted that there is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court of law will accept this position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if the nature and extent of our operations changed. If the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and certain information reporting requirements. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election available under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, or the Code (which election could itself have adverse consequences for such shareholders, as discussed below under "Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Income Taxation – U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders"), such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of their shares of our common stock, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder's holding period of the shares of our common stock. See "Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Income Taxation – U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders" for a more comprehensive discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC. Based on the current and expected composition of our and our subsidiaries' assets and income, it is not anticipated that we will be treated as a PFIC. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly there can be no assurances regarding our status as a PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable year. See the discussion in the section entitled "Item 10.E. Taxation — Passive Foreign Investment Company Regulations." We urge U.S. Holders to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules. 28 We may have to pay tax on U.S. source income, which would reduce our earnings. Under the Code, 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation, such as us and our subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States, exclusive of certain U.S. territories and possessions, may be subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations recently promulgated thereunder. We believe that we qualify for the benefits of Section 883. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us or any one of our ship-operating companies to fail to qualify for this tax exemption and thereby subject us to U.S. federal income tax on our U.S. source income. For example, we would fail to qualify for exemption under Section 883 of the Code for a particular tax year if shareholders, each of whom owned, actually or under applicable constructive ownership rules, a 5% or greater interest in the vote and value of the outstanding shares of our stock, owned in the aggregate 50% or more of the vote and value of the outstanding shares of our stock, and "qualified shareholders" as defined by the regulations to Section 883 did not own, directly or under applicable constructive ownership rules, sufficient sha res in our closely-held block of stock to preclude the shares in the closely-held block that are not so owned from representing 50% or more of the value of our stock for more than half of the number of days during the taxable year. Establishing such ownership by qualified shareholders will depend upon the status of certain of our direct or indirect shareholders as residents of qualifying jurisdictions and whether those shareholders own their shares through bearer share arrangements. In addition, such shareholders will also be required to comply with ownership certification procedures attesting that they are residents of qualifying jurisdictions, and each intermediary's or other person's similar compliance in the chain of ownership between us and such shareholders. Due to the factual nature of the issues involved, we can give no assurances on the tax-exempt status of ourselves or that of any of our subsidiaries. If we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to exemption under Section 883 for any taxable year, we or our subsidiaries could be subject for those years to an effective 4% U.S. federal income tax on the shipping income such companies derive during the year that is attributable to the transport of cargoes to or from the United States. The imposition of this taxation would have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our shareholders. The enactment of proposed legislation could affect whether dividends paid by us constitute qualified dividend income eligible for a preferential rate of United States federal income taxation. Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate that would deny the preferential rate of U.S. federal income tax currently imposed on qualified dividend income with respect to dividends received from a non-U.S. corporation, unless the non-U.S. corporation either is eligible for benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States or is created or organized under the laws of a foreign country that has a comprehensive income tax system. Because the Marshall Islands has not entered into a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States and imposes only limited taxes on corporations organized under its laws, it is unlikely that we could satisfy either of these requirements. Consequently, if this legislation were enacted, the preferential rate of U.S. federal income tax discussed under "Item 10. Additional Inform ation—E. Tax Considerations—United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—United States Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders—Distributions on Our Common Stock" may no longer be applicable to dividends received from us. As of the date hereof, it is not possible to predict with any certainty whether the proposed legislation will be enacted. Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings. 29 Issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the voting power of our shareholders and have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation currently authorize our Board to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, with respect to, among other things, dividends, conversion, voting, redemption, liquidation and the number of shares constituting any series subject to prior shareholders' approval. If our Board determines to issue preferred shares, such issuance may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable. The issuance of preferred shares with voting and conversion rights may also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common shares. This could substantially impede the ability of public shareholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium. You may experience dilution as a result of the exercise of our warrants. We have 38,984,667 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued and outstanding at an exercise price of $6.50 per share. In addition, we have assumed Seanergy Maritime's obligation to issue 1,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock under the unit purchase option it granted the underwriter in its initial public offering at an exercise price of $12.50 per unit. Lastly, we issued to Maxim Group LLC and Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, the joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters in connection with the public offering of shares of our common stock that we completed on February 3, 2010, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,138,917 shares with an exercise price of $1.32 per share. As a result, you may experience dilution if any of these warrants are exercised.
