ITEM 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this annual report, including the financial statements and related notes, when deciding to invest in us. You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this annual report could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Because we have a limited operating history in certain of our operating areas, our future operating results are difficult to forecast, and our failure to sustain profitability in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We may not maintain the current level of revenues, natural gas and crude oil reserves or production we now attribute to the properties contributed to us when we were formed and those developed and acquired since our formation. Any future growth of our natural gas and crude oil reserves, production and operations could place significant demands on our financial, operational and administrative resources. Our failure to sustain profitability in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Natural gas and crude oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend in part on prevailing natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we can borrow under our senior secured credit facilities is subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that we can economically produce. While prices for natural gas and crude oil may be favorable at any point in time, they fluctuate widely. For example, the closing NYMEX wholesale price of natural gas was at a six-year low of approximately $2.00 per Mcf for February 2002, and reached an all-time high of approximately $13.83 per Mcf for November 2005. During 2007, the closing NYMEX wholesale natural gas price ranged from a low of $5.43 per Mcf for September to a high of $7.59 per Mcf for June. Among the factors that can cause these fluctuations are:  domestic and foreign demand for natural gas and crude oil;  the level of domestic and foreign natural gas and crude oil supplies;  the price and availability of alternative fuels;  weather conditions; 17 Table of Contents  domestic and foreign governmental regulations;  impact of trade organizations, such as OPEC;  political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions; and  worldwide economic conditions. Due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices and our inability to control the factors that affect natural gas and crude oil prices, we cannot predict whether prices will remain at current levels, increase or decrease in the future. If natural gas or crude oil prices decrease or our exploration and development efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record impairments of our oil and gas properties. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The reported financial results and disclosures were developed using certain significant accounting policies, practices and estimates, which are discussed in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this annual report. We employ the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs associated with acquiring, exploring for, and developing natural gas and crude oil reserves are capitalized and accumulated in separate country cost centers. These capitalized costs are amortized based on production from the reserves for each country cost center. Each capitalized cost pool cannot exceed the net present value of the underlying natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves. An impairment to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties could result if natural gas, NGL and/or crude oil prices were to drop precipitously at a reporting period end and remain depressed for a period of time. Future price declines or increased operating and capitalized costs without incremental increases in natural gas and crude oil reserves could also require us to record a significant impairment expense. Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. The process of estimating natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed in this annual report. In order to prepare these estimates, we and independent reserve engineers engaged by us must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We and the engineers must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions with respect to natural gas and crude oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices and revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and crude oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed in this annual report. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2007, approximately 38% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Undeveloped reserves, by their nature, are less certain than comparable developed reserves. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires additional capital expenditures and successful drilling and completion operations. Our reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards and SEC requirements, there is risk that the 18 Table of Contents estimated costs are inaccurate, that development will not occur as scheduled or that actual results will not be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows disclosed in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by natural gas, NGL and crude oil purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and crude oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the natural gas and oil industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the 10% discount factor. Our production is concentrated in a small number of geographic areas. Approximately 42% of our 2007 production was from Texas, approximately 29% was from the Northeast Operations and approximately 27% was from Alberta, Canada. With the November 1, 2007 divestiture of our Northeast Operations, our production concentration in Texas and Canada has increased. Because of our concentration in these geographic areas, any regional events that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production, including weather and natural disasters, may impact us more than if our operations were more geographically diversified. Our Canadian operations present unique risks and uncertainties, different from or in addition to those we face in our domestic operations. We conduct our Canadian operations through Quicksilver Resources Canada Inc. At December 31, 2007, our proved Canadian reserves were estimated to be 328 Bcf. Capital expenditures relating to our Canadian operations are budgeted to be approximately $90 million in 2008, constituting approximately 10% of our total 2008 budgeted capital expenditures. We expect that our 2008 Canadian capital budget will be funded from Canadian operating cash flow. If our revenues decrease as a result of lower natural gas or crude oil prices or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our entire 2008 Canadian capital budget, or may opt to increase our Canadian debt levels to fund 2008 capital expenditures. While our results to date indicate that net recoverable reserves on CBM lands could be substantial, we can offer you no assurance that development will occur as scheduled or that actual results will be in accordance with estimates. Other risks of our operations in Canada include, among other things, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect our Canadian operations. We may have difficulty financing our planned growth. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience capital expenditure and working capital needs, particularly as a result of increases in our property acquisition and drilling activities that are in excess of our cash generated from our operations. In the future, we will likely require additional financing in addition to cash generated from our operations to fund our planned growth. If revenues decrease as a result of lower natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices or otherwise, our ability to expend the capital necessary to replace our reserves or to maintain production of current levels may be limited, resulting in a decrease in production over time. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In the event 19 Table of Contents additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our acquisition, development drilling and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis. We are vulnerable to operational hazards, transportation dependencies, regulatory risks and other uninsured risks associated with our activities. The natural gas and oil business involves operating hazards such as well blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, treatment plant downtime, pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, any of which could cause us to experience substantial losses. Also, the availability of a ready market for our natural gas and crude oil production depends on the proximity of reserves to, and the capacity of, natural gas and crude oil gathering systems, treatment plants, pipelines and trucking or terminal facilities. U.S. and Canadian federal, state and provincial regulation of natural gas and oil production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce and market our natural gas and crude oil. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased or leased by us. As a result of operating hazards, regulatory risks and other uninsured risks, we could incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of such risks and losses in accordance with customary industry practice. Generally, environmental risks are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The failure to replace our reserves could adversely affect our production and cash flows. Our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. In order to increase reserves and production, we must continue our development drilling and recompletion programs or undertake other replacement activities. Our current strategy is to maintain our focus on low-cost operations while increasing our reserve base, production and cash flow through exploration and development of our existing properties coupled with possible acquisitions of prospective non-producing properties and, to a lesser extent, producing properties. We cannot assure you, however, that our planned exploration, development projects or acquisition activities will result in meaningful additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells. Furthermore, while our revenues may increase if prevailing natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices increase materially, our finding costs for additional reserves also could increase. We cannot assure distributions on, or the recorded investment value for, our BBEP interests. We own a 32% limited partner interest in BBEP from which we expect to receive cash flows in the form of distributions. We have no management oversight or influence over BBEP or its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and are indirectly subject to the risks associated with BBEPs business and operations. Moreover, the management of BBEP has discretion over whether any distributions are made to unitholders and the amount of those distributions, if any. The nature of our ownership interest in a publicly-traded entity subjects us to market risks associated with most ownership interests traded on a public exchange. Sales of substantial amounts of BBEP limited partner units, or a perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our BBEP limited partner units, which could result in a temporary or permanent impairment of our limited partner interest in BBEP. 20 Table of Contents We depend on KGS to gather, process and transport most of our Barnett Shale gas production, and we own more than 70% of KGS. In connection with the KGS IPO, among other transactions, we transferred to KGS most of our pipeline gathering system located in the southern portion of the Fort Worth Basin (the Cowtown Pipeline) and our natural gas processing plant located in Hood County, Texas (the Cowtown Plant), and we entered into an agreement for 10 years with KGS under which we are obligated to offer to KGS the right to provide gathering and processing services for substantially all of our production in Hood, Somervell, Johnson, Tarrant, Hill, Parker, Bosque and Erath Counties in North Texas and are charged specified fees. KGS has the option to purchase certain pipeline assets from us at historical cost within two years after those assets are complete and commence commercial service. KGS is obligated to purchase the Lake Arlington Dry System and the Hill County Dry System from us at fair market value within two years after those assets commence commercial service. As a result of the transactions and arrangements described above, we have diminished control over assets that are important to our business and operations, we are committed to transactions that will not necessarily be economically advantageous at the times at which they are ultimately consummated and increased demands have been placed on certain of our personnel who perform services for both us and KGS. If our use of assets transferred to KGS is interrupted due to factors beyond our control, the commitments that we have to KGS prove to be uneconomic or the effectiveness of our management personnel is decreased due to their responsibilities to KGS, we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, through our ownership interest in KGS, we share in KGS results of operations and may be entitled to distributions from KGS. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the risks associated with KGS business and operations, including, but not limited to:  changes in general economic conditions;  fluctuations in natural gas prices;  failure or delays in us and third parties achieving expected production from natural gas projects;  competitive conditions in our industry;  actions taken by unaffiliated operators, processors and transporters;  changes in the availability and cost of capital;  operating hazards, natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control;  construction costs or capital expenditures exceeding estimated budgeted costs or expenditures;  the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations;  the effects of future litigation; and  other factors discussed in KGS Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-140599) and as are or may be detailed from time to time in KGS public announcements and other filings with the SEC. We cannot control the operations of gas processing and transportation facilities we do not own or operate. At December 31, 2007, we deliver our Canadian production to market primarily by either the TransCanada or ATCO systems. We have no influence over the operation of these facilities and must depend upon the owners of these facilities to minimize any loss of processing and transportation capacity. 21 Table of Contents The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent on a relatively small group of key management personnel, including our Chairman, our CEO and our other executive officers and key technical personnel. There is a risk that the services of these individuals will not be available to us in the future. Because competition for experienced personnel in the natural gas and oil industry is intense, we may not be able to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the natural gas and oil industry. Accordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. Competition in our industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than many of our competitors. We compete with major and independent natural gas and oil companies for property acquisitions. We also compete for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate these properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive natural gas and crude oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to explore for natural gas and crude oil prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to complete transactions in this highly competitive environment. Furthermore, the natural gas and oil industry competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel needs of industrial, commercial, and other consumers. Hedging our production may result in losses or limit our ability to benefit from price increases. To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices for our production, we have entered into financial hedging arrangements which tend to limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. These hedging arrangements also expose us to risk of financial losses in some circumstances, including the following:  our production could be materially less than expected; or  the other parties to the hedging contracts could fail to perform their contractual obligations. The result of natural gas and crude oil market prices exceeding our swap prices requires us to make payment for the settlement of our hedge derivatives on the fifth day of the production month for natural gas hedges, and the fifth day after the production month for NGL and crude oil hedges. If we choose not to engage in hedging arrangements in the future, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements. Delays in obtaining oil field equipment and increases in drilling and other service costs could adversely affect our ability to pursue our drilling program and our results of operations. There is currently a high demand for drilling equipment and supplies. Higher natural gas, NGL and oil prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. We believe that this high demand and increased prices could continue. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, and we may experience shortages of, or material increases in the cost of, drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services in the future. Any such delays and price increases could adversely affect our ability to pursue our drilling program and our results of operations. 22 Table of Contents Our activities are regulated by complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Natural gas, NGL and crude oil operations are subject to various U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local government laws and regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions. Matters that are typically regulated include:  discharge permits for drilling operations;  drilling permits and bonds;  reports concerning operations;  spacing of wells;  disposal wells;  unitization and pooling of properties;  environmental protection; and  taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of natural gas and crude oil wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of natural gas and crude oil. We also are subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted. The development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of natural gas and crude oil, by-products and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with natural gas and crude oil operations are also subject to laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. The discharge of natural gas, crude oil or pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties or require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. Legal and tax requirements frequently are changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot assure you that existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of servicing our debt could adversely affect our business; and such risk could increase if we incur more debt. At December 31, 2007, we had total consolidated debt of $813.9 million. Subject to the limits contained in the loan agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes, we may incur additional debt. Our ability to borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facilities is subject to the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas, NGL and crude oil properties and other assets, including our units owned in BreitBurn. One of our senior secured revolving credit facilities enables us to borrow significant amounts in Canadian dollars to fund and support our operations in Canada. Such indebtedness exposes us to currency exchange risk associated with the Canadian dollar. If we incur additional indebtedness or fail to increase the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas and crude oil properties, the risks that we now face as a result of our indebtedness could intensify. We have demands on our cash resources in addition to interest expense on our indebtedness, including, among others, operating expenses and principal payments under our senior secured revolving credit facilities, our senior subordinated notes and our convertible subordinated debentures as well as partial funding of our planned capital expenditures. Our level of indebtedness relative to our proved reserves and these significant demands on our cash resources could have important effects on our business and on your investment in Quicksilver. For example, they could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; 23 Table of Contents  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  require us to make principal payments under our senior secured revolving credit facilities if the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas and crude oil properties are insufficient to support our level of borrowings under such credit facilities;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the natural gas and oil industry;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financing flexibility than we do;  limit our financial flexibility, including our ability to borrow additional funds;  increase our interest expense if interest rates increase, because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;  limit our ability to make capital expenditures to develop our properties;  increase our vulnerability to exchange risk associated with Canadian dollar denominated indebtedness and international operations in Canada;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and  result in an event of default upon a failure to comply with financial covenants contained in our senior secured revolving credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to pay principal and interest on our long-term debt and to satisfy our other liabilities will depend upon our future performance and our ability to refinance our debt as it becomes due. Our future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by economic and capital markets conditions, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operating costs, we will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:  reducing or delaying capital expenditures;  seeking additional debt financing or equity capital;  selling assets; or  restructuring or refinancing debt. There can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our senior secured revolving credit facilities and senior subordinated notes restrict our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to engage in certain activities. The loan agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to, among other things:  incur additional debt;  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  make certain investments;  incur or permit to exist certain liens; 24 Table of Contents  enter into transactions with affiliates;  merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company;  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and  redeem subordinated debt. The loan agreements for our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes contain certain covenants, which, among other things, require the maintenance of a minimum current ratio, a minimum collateral coverage ratio, a minimum earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, non-cash income and expense, and exploration costs) to interest expense ratio, and a minimum earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, non-cash income and expense and exploration costs) to fixed charges ratio. Our ability to borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facilities is dependent upon the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas and crude oil properties. Our ability to meet these covenants or requirements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. The covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a breach of the restrictive covenants in our loan agreements or the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes, or any instrument governing our future indebtedness, or our inability to maintain the financial ratios described above could result in an event of default under the applicable instrument. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the applicable creditors could, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable instrument, elect to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Moreover, any of our debt agreements that contain a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision that would be triggered by such default or acceleration would also be subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of such default or acceleration. If we were unable to repay amounts due under our senior secured revolving credit facilities, the creditors could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. If the payment of our indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and our other indebtedness that would become due as a result of any acceleration. The above restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. A small number of existing stockholders exercise significant control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of stockholder votes. Members of the Darden family, together with Quicksilver Energy, L.P., which is primarily owned by members of the Darden family, beneficially own approximately 34% of our common stock as of December 31, 2007. As a result, these entities and individuals will generally be able to significantly affect the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our charter or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. A large number of our outstanding shares and shares to be issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes or exercise of our outstanding options may be sold into the market in the future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. Our shares that are eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. There were over 158 million shares of our common stock outstanding at December 31, 2007. Approximately 102 million of these shares are freely tradable without substantial restriction or the requirement of future registration under the Securities Act. In addition, the necessary restrictions for our contingently convertible debentures have been satisfied and are now convertible at their holders option, which based on the conversion rate in effect at December 31, 2007, could result in the issuance of an aggregate of 9,816,256 shares of our common stock. In addition, at December 31, 2007 we had 1,021,912 options outstanding to purchase shares of 25 Table of Contents our common stock as detailed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or a perception that such sales could occur, and the existence of conversion and option rights to acquire shares of common stock at prices that may be below the then current market price of the common stock, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control without our board of directors approval. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control without our board of directors approval. In this regard:  our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;  our board of directors is classified; and  advance notice is required for director nominations by stockholders and actions to be taken at annual meetings at the request of stockholders. In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan. The provisions described above and the stockholder rights plan could impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to take control of us, even if that change of control might be beneficial to stockholders, thus increasing the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions. In certain circumstances, the fact that corporate devices are in place that will inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. ITEM 1B.
