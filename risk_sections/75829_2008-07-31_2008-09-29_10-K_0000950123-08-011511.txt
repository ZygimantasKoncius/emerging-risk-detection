ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The risk factors described below are not inclusive of all risk factors but highlight those that the Company believes are the most significant and that could impact its performance and financial results. These risk factors should be considered together with all other information presented in this Form 10-K report. Litigation and regulatory inquiries associated with the restatement of the Companys prior period financial statements could result in substantial costs, penalties and other adverse effects. Substantial costs may be incurred to defend and resolve regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of or relating to matters underlying our recent restatement of prior period financial statements. These proceedings include the ongoing audits in process of the Companys tax returns, as well as audits expected to commence of the Companys tax returns for some of the periods affected by the restatement. In September 2007, the Company deposited $135 million with the U.S. Treasury, which reflected managements preliminary assessment of additional taxes and interest that the Company might owe the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for prior years as a result of tax compliance matters identified at the time and did not include any amount with respect to potential penalties. In completing the restatement, the Company examined the appropriateness of the Companys accounting treatment of the tax consequences of each type of intercompany transaction in the various taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates. As a result of this analysis, the Company determined that additional financial statement reserves were required with respect to certain other lesser tax compliance matters. The Company cannot predict when the ongoing IRS audit will be completed or the amount or timing of the final resolution with the IRS or other relevant taxing authorities of the matters that gave rise to the restatement, including the amount of any penalties that may be imposed, which could be substantial. The Company is also subject to other regulatory and litigation proceedings relating to, or arising out of, the restatement, including pending investigations by the SEC and the Department of Justice, purported securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits seeking relief against certain of the Companys officers and directors. These proceedings could also result in civil or criminal fines and other non-monetary penalties. The Company has not reserved any amount in respect of these matters in its consolidated financial statements. The Company cannot predict whether any monetary losses it experiences in the proceedings will be covered by insurance or whether insurance proceeds recovered will be sufficient to offset such losses. Pending civil, regulatory and criminal proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of the Companys management from business operations, particularly if adverse developments are experienced in any of them, such as an expansion of the investigations being conducted by the SEC and the Department of Justice. See Part I  Item 3  Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of these pending matters. Changes in the Companys effective tax rate may affect operating results. Fluctuations in the Companys effective tax rate may affect operating results. The Companys effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation based on a variety of factors, such as:  the geographical mix of income derived from the countries in which it operates;  currently applicable tax rates, including particularly in the United States;  the nature, timing and impact of permanent or temporary changes in tax laws or regulations, including the termination or extension of provisions under U.S. federal income tax law that are or may become subject to sunset, such as research and development credits and incentives related to U.S. domestic production;  the timing and amount of the Companys repatriation of foreign earnings;  the timing and nature of the Companys resolution of uncertain income tax positions; and  the Companys success in managing its effective tax rate through the implementation of global tax and cash management strategies. 8 Table of Contents The Company operates in numerous countries and is subject to taxation in all of the countries in which it operates. The tax rules and regulations in such countries can be complex and, in many cases, uncertain in their application. In addition to challenges to the Companys tax positions arising during routine audits, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Companys business conducted within the country involved and with respect to intercompany transactions when the parties are taxed in different jurisdictions. Pending proceedings to which the Company is subject include ongoing audits of the Companys tax returns for some of the periods affected by the restatement, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of the completion of those audits, which could result in the imposition of additional taxes and substantial penalties. See Litigation and regulatory inquiries associated with the restatement of the Companys prior period financial statements could result in substantial costs, penalties and other adverse effects. Changes in product mix and product pricing may affect the Companys operating results particularly with the expansion of the systems business, in which the Company experiences significantly longer sales cycles with less predictable revenue and no certainty of future revenue streams from related consumable product offerings and services. The Companys TFM strategy is partially reliant on sales of integrated systems. Because systems are generally sold at lower gross margins than many other products, gross margins could decline if systems sales continue to grow as a percentage of total sales and the anticipated future revenue streams from related consumable product offerings and services are not realized. The Companys systems platform generally also experiences significantly longer sales cycles and involves less predictable revenue and uncertainty of future revenue streams from related consumable product offerings and services. In addition, the profitability of the Companys systems sales depends substantially on the ability of management to estimate accurately the costs involved in manufacturing and implementing the relevant system according to the customers specifications. Company estimates can be adversely affected by disruptions in a customers plans or operations and unforeseen events, such as manufacturing defects. Failure to accurately estimate the Companys cost of system sales can adversely affect the profitability of those sales, and the Company may not be able to recover lost profits through pricing or other actions. Increases in costs of manufacturing and operating costs may affect operating results. The Companys costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, energy and related utilities and cost of labor. The achievement of the Companys financial objectives is reliant on its ability to manage these fluctuations through cost savings or recovery actions and efficiency initiatives. The Company may not be able to achieve the savings anticipated from its cost reduction and margin improvement initiatives, including the timing of completion of its facilities rationalization initiative. In fiscal year 2006, the Company began an extensive program to restructure manufacturing operations, including the closing of up to 12 facilities around the globe. One of the purposes of this initiative is to reduce manufacturing costs and improve gross margins. Unexpected delays or other factors in the facilities rationalization initiative and other cost reduction initiatives could impact the Companys ability to realize the anticipated savings and to improve or maintain gross margins. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may affect operating results. In fiscal year 2008, the Company derived 71% of sales from outside the United States. Sales outside the United States are typically made in the local currencies of those countries. The primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the U.S. dollar to the British Pound, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar and the Singapore Dollar, as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the Pound to the Euro. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect operating results. Giving effect to the Companys interest rate swap, the Companys debt portfolio was approximately 50% variable rate at July 31, 2008. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect operating results. The Company may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or market acceptance of new technologies. Part of the Companys planned growth is dependent on new products and technologies. Some of those new products may require regulatory approval. Growth from those new technologies may not be realized if regulatory approval is not granted or customer demand for those products or technologies does not materialize. 9 Table of Contents Changes in demand for the Companys products and business relationships with key customers and suppliers, including delays or cancellations in shipments, may affect operating results. To achieve its objectives, the Company must develop and sell products that are subject to the demands of customers. This is dependent on many factors including, but not limited to, managing and maintaining relationships with key customers, responding to the rapid pace of technological change and obsolescence, which may require increased investment by or greater pressure to commercialize developments rapidly or at prices that may not fully recover the associated investment, and the effect on demand resulting from customers research, development and capital expenditure plans. The manufacturing of the Companys products is dependent on an adequate supply of raw materials. The Companys ability to maintain an adequate supply of raw materials could be impacted by the availability and price of those raw materials and maintaining relationships with key suppliers. The Company may not successfully enforce patents and protect proprietary products and manufacturing techniques. Some of the Companys products, as well as some competitors products, are based on patented technology and other intellectual property rights. Some of these patented technologies and intellectual property require substantial resources to develop. Operating results may be affected by the costs associated with the Companys defense of its intellectual property against unauthorized use by others, as well as third-party challenges to its intellectual property. The Company could also experience disruptions in its business, including loss of revenues and adverse effects on its prospects, if its patented or other proprietary technologies are successfully challenged. The Company may not be able to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions. In so far as acquisition opportunities are identified, there is no assurance of the Companys ability to complete any such transactions and successfully integrate the acquired business as planned. The Company is subject to domestic and international competition in all of its global markets. The Company is subject to competition in all of the global markets in which it operates. The Companys achievement of its objectives is reliant on its ability to successfully respond to many competitive factors including, but not limited to, pricing, technological innovations, product quality, customer service, manufacturing capabilities and hiring and retention of qualified personnel. The Company may be impacted by global and regional economic conditions and legislative, regulatory and political developments. The Company conducts operations around the globe. The Company expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of sales and earnings from outside the United States. A recession in the United States could have a negative impact on demand for the Companys products not only in the United States, but also globally. Sales and earnings could also be affected by the Companys ability to manage the risks and uncertainties associated with the application of local legal requirements or the enforceability of laws and contractual obligations, trade protection measures, changes in tax laws, regional political instability, war, terrorist activities, severe or prolonged adverse weather conditions and natural disasters as well as health epidemics or pandemics. The Company may be adversely affected by the current economic environment As a result of the credit market crisis (including uncertainties with respect to financial institutions and the global capital markets), increases in energy costs and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world, customers or vendors may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result, may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase the Companys products and vendors may significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output. Additionally, if customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to the Company. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay the Company for its products may adversely affect the Companys earnings and cash flow. If economic conditions in the United States and other key markets deteriorate further or do not show improvement, the Company may experience material adverse impacts to its business and operating results. 10 Table of Contents If the Company experiences a disruption of its information technology systems, or if the Company fails to successfully implement, continue to manage and integrate its information technology systems, it could harm the Companys business. The Companys information technology (IT) systems are an integral part of its business. A serious disruption of its IT systems, whether caused by fire, storm, flood, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins or viruses, or any other events, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. The Company depends on its IT systems to: process customer orders and invoices, provide customer service, collect accounts receivable, purchase products from its suppliers, manage inventory, and consolidate these and other transactions for its financial reporting and monitoring mechanisms. The Company cannot provide assurance that its contingency plans will allow it to operate at its current level of efficiency in the event of a serious IT disruption. Additionally, the Companys ability to most effectively implement its business plans in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning, reporting and analytical processes and systems. The Company expects that it will need to continue to improve and further integrate its IT systems, reporting systems and operating procedures on an ongoing basis. If the Company fails to incrementally improve, manage and integrate its IT systems, reporting systems and operating procedures, it could adversely affect the Companys ability to achieve its objectives.
