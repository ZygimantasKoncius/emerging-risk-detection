ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report. We May Be Unsuccessful in Maintaining Our Growth Rate Our ability to maintain our growth rate depends on our successful implementation of various strategies, including:  Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new products with new features, functions and capabilities, including in-house laboratory analyzers such as Catalyst Dx and SNAPshot Dx, rapid assay and other specialized diagnostic tests and services, water testing products, production animal diagnostic products, and companion animal veterinary pharmaceuticals, as well as improving and enhancing existing products;  Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business areas for us;  Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products, including the interoperability among the IDEXX VetLab® instrument suite, Cornerstone® practice information management system, the IDEXX-PACS software and IDEXX Reference Laboratories;  Expanding our market by expanding the installed base of our instrumentation through customer acquisition and retention and increasing use of our products by our customers; and  Strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S. 10 However, we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability. Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, FDA and the EPA. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI® line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers, which we acquired in January 2007, are regulated by the FDA and require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are subject to an agreement with the FDA under which we are required, among other things, to perform selected specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP® beta-lactam dairy testing products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the FDA were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability, the FDA could take various actions, including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products. Sales of dairy antibiotic residue-testing products were $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Reduce Our Profitability We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our VetAutoread Hematology, VetLyte® Electrolyte and IDEXX VetLab® UA urinalysis analyzers and related consumables and accessories; the consumables associated with our VetTest chemistry analyzers; certain digital radiography system components, specifically image capture plates and readers; active ingredients for pharmaceutical products; and certain components of our SNAP® rapid assay devices, water testing products and LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions, delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Minimum Purchase Obligations Under Certain Agreements Could Reduce Our Profitability We purchase the slides sold for use in our VetTest® Chemistry Analyzers under an agreement with Ortho that, as of December 31, 2006, required us to purchase a minimum of $59.0 million of slides through 2010. We purchase our VetAutoread Hematology Analyzers, components and consumables under an agreement under which we are required to make aggregate minimum purchases of $15.7 million through 2020. We also have minimum purchase commitments under the terms of certain other supply agreements that commit us to future payments of $20.4 million. If demand for any of the products purchased under these agreements is insufficient to support our minimum purchase obligations for those products, we could incur losses related to those obligations. In addition, because we purchase the products at predetermined prices, our profits on sales of these products could decline if we are unable to maintain current pricing levels for such products. We May be Required to Discontinue Sales of One of Our Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products One of our veterinary pharmaceutical products is sold under the FDAs regulatory discretion and we believe that the FDA would require us to discontinue sales of this product within a short period if and when the FDA approves another product to treat the same condition, whether such new product was our product or that of another commercial supplier. In addition, we have a finite inventory of the raw materials used in the manufacture of the product, and these raw materials are no longer commercially available. We believe that our remaining inventory of raw materials will be adequate to satisfy existing market demand until late 2008 or early 2009. We have, in advanced development and clinical trials, a new product based on different raw materials and we intend to seek FDA approval of this product. FDA approval of this new product would fully mitigate the commercial risk that we would be required to stop selling our current product due either to FDA approval of another manufacturers product or to the full depletion of our inventory of raw materials. While we hope to smoothly transition to our new product, we cannot predict when or if the FDA will approve our new product or any product that treats the same condition from another manufacturer. Revenues from sales of this pharmaceutical product were $11.9 million in 2006. 11 Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market Many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us. We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights. In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products. In addition, our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors, the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Our financial performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable. Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph. 12 Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do. Changes in Testing Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results The market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our production animal products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition, changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On December 29, 2006, the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the U.K. published a proposal to discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for Cryptosporidia effective as of December 22, 2007 or, if approved by the regulator, at an earlier date. If this proposal is adopted, the Company believes that it will lose a substantial portion of its sales of Filta-Max® products in England and Wales, which were $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidation of Veterinary Hospitals in the U.S. Could Negatively Affect Our Business An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners include VCA/Antech, Inc. and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, both of whom are currently customers of IDEXX. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results. In addition, VCA/Antech is our primary competitor in the U.S. market for reference laboratory services, and hospitals acquired by VCA/Antech will use its laboratory services almost exclusively. Therefore, hospitals acquired by VCA/Antech generally will cease to be customers or potential customers of our reference laboratories business. Our Inexperience in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market Upon acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc, we entered the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the OPTI® line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, and more rapid technological innovation. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market. Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results For the year ended December 31, 2006, 35% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. We utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins. 13 The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our Business We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business. We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If Our Quarterly Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, research and development expenditures, litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors product offerings; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall. Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings. ITEM 1B.
