RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating the Companys business and future prospects. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to the Company and its business. Investors should also read the other information included in this Form 10-K, including the financial statements and related notes. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect results and the price of the Companys common stock. This volatility also makes valuation of oil and natural gas producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a number of factors, including:  relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;  market uncertainty;  worldwide economic conditions;  weather conditions;  import prices;  political conditions in major oil producing regions, especially the Middle East;  actions taken by OPEC;  competition from other sources of energy; and  economic, political and regulatory developments. Price volatility makes it difficult to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving oil and natural gas properties and to estimate with precision the value of producing properties that are owned or acquired. In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and natural gas properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties. Quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of, among other things, variations in oil and natural gas prices and production performance. In recent years, oil and natural gas price volatility has become increasingly severe. (5) Table of Contents A substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on the Company. A substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, access to capital and the quantities of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced. A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would have a negative effect in several ways including:  cash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves or increase production;  certain reserves may no longer be economic to produce, leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flow; and  access to sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable. Lower oil and natural gas prices may cause impairment charges. The Company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities. Exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized by property using the unit-of-production method as oil and gas is produced. All long-lived assets, principally the Companys oil and gas properties, are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows. The need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when the Company approves the plan to sell. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, the Company can not predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. If an impairment charge is recognized, cash flow from operating activities is not impacted but net income and consequently shareholders equity are reduced. Although the Companys estimated oil and natural gas reserve data is prepared by a consulting engineering firm, estimates may still prove to be inaccurate. The Companys reserve data represents the estimates of Campbell and Associates, a consulting petroleum engineering firm. Reserve estimates are prepared for all of the Companys properties annually by the reservoir engineer with a limited review mid-year report also prepared. Incorporated into reserve estimates are many factors and assumptions including:  expected reservoir characteristics based on geological, geophysical and engineering assessments;  future production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities;  future oil and gas prices; and  future development and operating costs. Management believes the assumptions are reasonable based on the information available at the time of the estimates, actual results could vary considerably which could cause material variances in the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves in the aggregate and for a particular geographic location or future net revenues, including production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures. Any significant variation from these assumptions could result in the actual quantity of reserves and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates. In addition, (6) Table of Contents estimates of reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, operating and development costs and other factors. Because a complete review of reserve projections is only done at the end of the year, any material change in a reserve estimate is included in subsequent reserve reports. Failure to find or acquire additional reserves, thus reserves and production will decline materially from their current levels. The rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that the Company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration and development drilling, successfully applies new technologies or identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the Companys proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and natural gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon the level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. All the above activities must be done in conjunction with operators of these wells, as the Company does not operate any of its wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve a targeted rate of return. We rely on the operators seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying prospects and in conducting exploration activities. The seismic data and other technologies used do not allow them to know conclusively prior to drilling a well whether oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The ultimate cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is controlled by these operators and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, title problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions, environmental and other governmental requirements and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services. Oil and natural gas drilling and producing operations involve various risks. The Company is subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including encountering well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failures, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks. The Company maintains insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed to be prudent. However, this insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. For example, the Company does not maintain business interruption insurance. Additionally, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. These risks could give rise to significant costs not covered by insurance that could have a material adverse effect upon financial reports. We can not control activities on properties we do not operate. The Company does not operate any of the properties in which it has an interest and has very limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs. Dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and the limited ability (7) Table of Contents to influence operations and associated costs could materially adversely affect the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and targeted production growth rates. The success and timing of drilling, development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Companys control, including the operators expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants for drilling wells and utilization of technology. Shortages of oil field equipment, services and qualified personnel could adversely affect results of operations. The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. There have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. These shortages or price increases could adversely affect the profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations.
