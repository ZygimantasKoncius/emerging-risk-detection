ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks set forth below and other matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Current and future economic conditions could materially adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. The success of our business model depends to a significant extent upon discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by a number of general economic factors, including without limitation consumer confidence, the housing market, employment levels, interest rates, inflation and taxation and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. Adverse trends in any of these economic indicators may adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. A reduction in the availability of credit to consumers generally or under our existing consumer credit programs could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. A high percentage of our sales are made under consumer credit programs through third parties. The recent economic downturn has resulted in a reduction of credit available to consumers as macroeconomic factors impact the financial position of consumers and as suppliers of credit adjust their lending criteria. In addition, changes in federal regulations that go into effect in 2010 place additional restrictions on all consumer credit programs, including limiting the types of promotional credit offerings that may be offered to consumers. GE Money Bank provides credit to our customers through a private label credit card program that expires on February 15, 2012, subject to earlier termination upon certain events and subject to automatic extensions. GE Money Bank has discretion to set minimum credit standards under which credit is extended to customers. In recent periods we have not been in compliance with certain financial covenants under our agreement with GE Money Bank, which has resulted in a requirement that we provide a letter of credit to collateralize potential exposure that GE Money Bank may have if we were unable to meet our obligations to our customers. Reduction of credit availability due to changing economic conditions, changes in credit standards under our private label credit card program or changes in regulatory requirements, or the termination of our agreement with GE Money Bank, could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Our future growth and profitability depends upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs. We are highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing messages and the efficiency of our advertising expenditures in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products. In recent periods, including in particular 2007 and 2008, our marketing messages were not as effective as in prior periods. We continue to evolve our marketing strategies, adjusting our messages, the amount we spend on advertising and where we spend it, and no assurance can be given that we will be successful in developing effective messages and in achieving efficiency in our advertising expenditures. We also believe that consumers are increasingly using the Internet as a part of their shopping experience. As a result, our future growth and profitability will depend in part on (i) the effectiveness and efficiency of our on-line advertising and search optimization programs in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products, (ii) our ability to prevent confusion among consumers that can result from search engines that allow competitors to use or bid on our trademarks to direct consumers to competitors’ websites, and (iii) our ability to prevent internet publication of false or misleading information regarding our products or our competitors’ products. If our marketing messages are ineffective or our advertising expenditures and other marketing programs, including internet-based programs, are inefficient in creating awareness of our products and brand name, driving consumer traffic to our points of distribution and motivating consumers to purchase our products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. 12 Table of Contents Our future growth and profitability depends on our ability to execute our retail store distribution strategy. Our company-controlled retail store distribution channel is our largest distribution channel and represents our largest opportunity for growth in sales and improvement in profitability. Our stores carry significant fixed costs. We are highly dependent on our ability to maintain and increase sales per store to improve our operating margins. Our stores are largely mall based. We depend on the continued popularity of malls as shopping destinations and the ability of mall anchor tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic for our retail stores. Any decrease in mall traffic could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. In 2009 we evolved our retail strategy, closing 72 stores to increase trade area per store and discontinued selling through traditional mattress retailers to drive more customers to our company-controlled channels. This strategy is designed to improve our customer experience by utilizing our company-controlled sales process and to improve profitability by driving a greater number of sales through a smaller base of stores. If we are unable to capture sales from these larger trade areas or to improve the overall customer experience, our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted We may also be required to incur significant costs to close stores as we realign our store base. Our longer term retail store distribution strategy is also dependent on our ability to renew existing store leases and to secure suitable locations for new store openings, in each case on a cost-effective basis. We may encounter higher than anticipated rents and other costs in connection with managing our retail store base, or may be unable to find or obtain suitable new locations. Our future growth and profitability depends on continuous improvement in our products and services. Our unique product advantages and the customer experience provided by our vertically integrated business model have been key drivers of our growth in the past. One of our current growth strategies is to develop product innovation and sleep expertise by enhancing existing products and by developing and marketing new products that deliver personalized comfort and better sleep. In addition, providing superior customer service levels through home delivery of our products and post sales service are designed to develop a superior brand image. Any failure to continue to develop and market enhanced or new products and improved service in a cost-effective manner could harm our ability to grow sales and improve our profitability. A failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product quality could negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Our products represent a significant departure from traditional innerspring mattresses, which have no moving parts and do not rely on electronics and air control systems. As a result, our beds may be susceptible to failures that do not exist with traditional mattresses. A failure to achieve and maintain acceptable quality standards could impact consumer acceptance of our products or could result in negative media and internet reports or owner dissatisfaction that could negatively impact our brand image and sales levels. In addition, a decline in product quality could result in an increase in return rates and a corresponding decrease in sales, or an increase in product warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves. An unexpected increase in return rates or warranty claims could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. As a consumer products company, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products is alleged to have resulted in personal injury or property damage. In the event that any of our products proves to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. In 2004 and in 2008, we experienced increased returns and adverse impacts on sales, as well as product liability litigation, as a result of media reports related to the alleged propensity of our products to develop mold. We may experience additional adverse impacts on sales and additional litigation in the event any similar media reports were to occur in the future. We maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall tha t results in significant adverse publicity against us, may have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. 13 Table of Contents Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. Because of the vertical integration of our business model we face significant competition with both a number of different types of mattress alternatives and a variety of retailers. The mattress industry is characterized by a high degree of concentration among the three largest manufacturers of innerspring mattresses and the largest manufacturer of viscoelastic foam mattresses. We believe that many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and manufacturing resources and better brand name recognition than we do and sell products through broader and more established distribution channels. A number of mattress manufacturers, including several of these larger competitors, have offered air beds that compete with our products. Our stores and other company-controlled distribution channels compete with other retailers who often provide a wider selection of mattress alternatives than we offer. Many of these retailers also have more points of distribution and greater brand name recognition than we do. These manufacturing and retailing competitors, or new entrants into the market, may compete aggressively and gain market share with existing and new mattress products, and may pursue or expand their presence in the air bed segment of the market. We have limited ability to anticipate the timing and scale of new product introductions, advertising campaigns or new pricing strategies by our competitors, which could inhibit our ability to retain or increase market share, or to maintain our product margins. If we are unable to effectively compete with other bedding manufacturers and other retailers, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. We may be unable to prevent other companies from using our technology or intellectual property in connection with the sale of competitive products. We own various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to certain elements of the design and function of our beds and related products. We also own several registered and unregistered trademarks and trademark applications, including in particular our Select Comfort and Sleep Number trademarks, which we believe have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products to customers. Our intellectual property rights may not provide substantial protection against infringement or piracy and may not prevent our competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar to or competitive with our beds or other products. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our technolo gy or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. We are not aware of any material intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims that may be asserted against us, however, it is possible that third parties, including competitors, may successfully assert such claims. The cost of defending such claims, or any resulting liability, or any failure to obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, may adversely impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. We utilize “just-in-time” manufacturing processes with minimal levels of inventory, which could leave us vulnerable to shortages in supply that may harm our ability to satisfy consumer demand and may adversely impact our sales and profitability. We generally assemble our products after we receive orders from customers utilizing “just-in-time” manufacturing processes with minimal levels of raw materials, work in process and finished goods inventories. Lead times for ordered components may vary significantly. In addition, some components used to manufacture our products are provided on a sole source basis. Any unexpected shortage of materials caused by any disruption of supply or an unexpected increase in the demand for our products, could lead to delays in shipping our beds to customers. Any such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. 14 Table of Contents We rely upon several key suppliers that are, in some instances, the only source of supply currently used by us for particular materials, components or services. A disruption in the supply or substantial increase in cost of any of these products or services could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. We currently obtain all of the materials and components used to produce our beds from outside sources. In several cases, including our proprietary air chambers, our proprietary blow-molded foundations, our adjustable foundations, various components for our Firmness Control Systems, as well as fabrics and zippers, we have chosen to obtain these materials and components from suppliers who serve as the only source of supply used by us at this time. While we believe that these materials and components, or suitable replacements, could be obtained from other sources, in the event of a disruption or loss of supply of relevant materials or components for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative sources of supply, or if found, may not be found on comparable terms. If our relationship with either the supplier of our air chambers or the supplier of our blow-molded foundations is terminated, we could have difficulty in replacing these sources since there are relatively few other suppliers presently capable of manufacturing these components. Similarly, we rely on UPS and other carriers to deliver some of our products to customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns and cause us to lose sales. Any increase in freight charges could increase our costs of doing business and harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Fluctuations in commodity prices could result in an increase in component costs and/or delivery costs. Our business is subject to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to fuel, oil, natural gas, rubber, cotton, plastic resin, steel and chemical ingredients used to produce foam. Increases in prices of these commodities or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials and product components, as well as increases in the cost of delivering our products to our customers. To the extent we are unable to offset any such increased costs through value engineering and similar initiatives, or through price increases, our profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. If we choose to increase prices to offset the increased costs, our unit sales volumes could be adversely impacted. Our business is subject to risks inherent in global sourcing activities. Our air chambers and some of our other components are manufactured outside the United States, and therefore are subject to risks associated with foreign sourcing of materials, including but not limited to:  Political instability resulting in disruption of trade;  Existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas on certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States;  Disruptions in transportation due to acts of terrorism, shipping delays, foreign or domestic dock strikes, customs inspections or other factors;  Foreign currency fluctuations; and  Economic uncertainties, including inflation. These factors could increase our costs of doing business with foreign suppliers, lead to inadequate inventory levels or delays in shipping beds to our customers, which could harm our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Disruption of operations in either of our two manufacturing facilities could increase our costs of doing business or lead to delays in shipping our beds. We have two manufacturing plants, which are located in Irmo, South Carolina and in Salt Lake City, Utah. We generally manufacture beds to fulfill orders rather than stocking finished goods inventory in our plants or stores. Therefore, the disruption of operations of either of our manufacturing facilities for a significant period of time may increase our costs of doing business and lead to delays in shipping our beds to customers. Such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Our manufacturing and retail operations are subject to a wide variety of government regulations which could increase costs or cause disruptions to our operations. We are subject to a wide variety of government regulations relating to the bedding industry or to various aspects of our business and operations, including without limitation; regulations relating to the proper labeling of bedding merchandise; flammability standards applicable to mattresses; environmental and product safety regulations; consumer protection and data privacy regulations; various “do not call” or “do not mail” list requirements; labor laws, including but not limited to laws relating to occupational health and safety, employee privacy, wages and hours, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity, and employee leaves and benefits; and import and export regulations. Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations and have implemented a variety of measures to promote continuing compliance, regulations may change over time and we may be required to incur expenses and/or to modify our operations in order to ensure compliance with these regulations or we may be found to be in violation of the foregoing laws or regulations, which could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Regulatory requirements related to flammability standards for mattresses may increase our product costs and increase the risk of disruption to our business. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission adopted new flammability standards and related regulations which became effective nationwide in July 2007 for mattresses and mattress and foundation sets. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in higher materials and manufacturing costs for our products, and has required modifications to our information systems and business operations, further increasing our costs and negatively impacting our capacity. These regulations require manufacturers to implement quality assurance programs and encourage manufacturers to conduct random testing of products. These regulations also require maintenance and retention of compliance documentation. These quality assurance and documentation requirements are costly to implement and maintain. If any product testing, other evidence, or regulatory inspections yield results indicating that any of our products may not meet the flammability standard, we may be required to temporarily cease production and distribution and/or to recall products from the field, and we may be subject to fines or penalties, any of which outcomes could harm our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. We may be unable to sustain sufficient financial resources to finance our operations and growth. Historically, we have relied on cash from operations to fund our operations and growth. Beginning in the second half of 2008, as a result of the significant downturn in the economy, we experienced significant constraints in our operating cash flow and liquidity and were substantially dependent upon our ability to access credit under our credit agreement. During 2009, we executed a variety of initiatives that enabled us to return to positive earnings and cash flow, repay our outstanding debt and establish a positive cash position. In addition, we renegotiated the terms of our credit facility and extended its term to June 30, 2011. Despite this turnaround, our financial resources are limited. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the credit markets remain constrained. Should economic conditions deteriorate significantly or if we were otherwise unable to maintain our profitability and cash flow, we may not be able to fund our operations and growth. In addition, such deterioration may impact our ability to remain in compliance with our credit agreement, limiting or eliminating our ability to utilize this source of funds. Our management information systems may not be adequate to meet the evolving needs of our business as well as existing and emerging regulatory requirements. We depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business. Our current information systems architecture includes some off-the-shelf programs as well as some key software that has been developed by our own programmers, using old programming languages that are no longer vendor-supported. Our business may be adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand our systems to meet the evolving needs of our business and existing and emerging regulatory requirements. Any failure of our systems and processes to adequately protect employee and customer information from theft or loss could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. 16 Table of Contents The loss of the services of any members of our executive management team could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy. We are currently dependent upon the continued services, ability and experience of our executive management team. The loss of the services of any member of our executive management team could have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy and growth initiatives and on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Our future growth and success will also depend upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel. Our charter and corporate documents and Minnesota law make a takeover of our company more difficult and expensive, which may prevent certain changes in control and limit the market price of our common stock. Our charter, bylaws, certain corporate documents and sections 671 and 673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company or which may increase the cost of an acquisition of our company. Provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our shareholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize five million undesignated shares. Without shareholder approval, our board of directors has the authority to create a class or series of shares from the undesignated shares and to set the terms of the class or series, including voting and dividend rights. With these rights, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board of directors, with directors serving for three-year terms and approximately one-third of the directors coming up for re-election each year. Having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest, which may be a necessary step in any acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors. In addition, we have a severance plan that may provide certain employees and executive officers with severance compensation if they are terminated in connection with a change in control of our company and stock award plans that provide for the acceleration of vesting of incentive stock awards upon a change in control of our company. The existence of these provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control of our company, could make a change in control of our company more difficult and expensive and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Risks of certain global events, such as terrorist attacks or a pandemic outbreak, could adversely impact our sales, profitability, financial condition or stock price. Additional terrorist attacks in the United States or against U.S. targets, or acts of war or threats of war or the escalation of current hostilities involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers of components of our products, may adversely impact our operations, causing delays or losses in the delivery of merchandise to us and decreased sales. These events could also cause an increase in oil or other commodity prices, which could adversely affect our materials or transportation costs, including the costs of delivery of our products to customers. A significant pandemic outbreak, or a perceived threat of such an outbreak, could cause significant disruptions to our supply chain, manufacturing capability and distribution system that could adversely impact our ability to produce and deliver products, which could result in a loss of sales and adversely impact our profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Any of these events could adversely impact consumer confidence and spending or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. These events also could cause, or deepen and prolong, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our sales, profitability, financial condition or stock price. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 17 Table of Contents
