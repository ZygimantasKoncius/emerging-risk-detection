Exhibits 81 Index of Exhibits 81 v Industrias Bachoco, S.A.B. de C.V. is a holding company with no operations other than holding the stock of its subsidiaries. Our principal operating subsidiary is Bachoco, S.A. de C.V. (“BSACV”), which owns the principal operating assets of Industrias Bachoco, S.A.B. de C.V. and accounted for 81.37% of consolidated total assets on December 31, 2011. References herein to “Bachoco,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its” or the “Company” are, unless the context requires otherwise, to Industrias Bachoco, S.A.B. de C.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole. We are incorporated under the laws of the United Mexican States (“Mexico”), but we have operations in both in Mexico and in the U.S. Our principal executive offices are located in Mexico at Avenida Tecnologico No. 401, Ciudad Industrial C.P. 38010, Celaya, Guanajuato, Mexico, and our telephone number is +52(461)618-3555. Presentation of Information We publish our financial statements in Mexican pesos and present our financial statements in accordance with Mexican Financial Reporting Standards (“Mexican FRS”). Information from the years 2008 to 2011, does not include the recognition of the effects of inflation, while financial information is presented in constant pesos as of December 31, 2007, based on the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) published by Banco de Mexico (the “Central Bank”). Mexican FRS B-10 supersedes Bulletin B-10 Recognition of the effects of inflation on the financial information and its five amendment documents as well as the related circulars and Interpretation of Financial Reporting Standards. The principal considerations established by this FRS are: Recognition of the effects of inflation – An entity operates in (a) an inflationary economic environment when cumulative inflation over the immediately preceding 3-year period is equal to or greater than 26.0%; and (b) a non-inflationary economic environment, when inflation over the aforementioned period is less than 26.0%. For more detail, see Note 2-d) in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to (a) above, similarly to the superseded Bulletin B-10, the comprehensive recognition of the effects of inflation is required. For case (b), the effects of inflation are not recognized; however, at the effective date of this FRS and when an entity ceases to operate in an inflationary economic environment, the restatement effects determined through the last period in which the entity operated in an inflationary economic environment (in our case 2007), must be kept and shall be reclassified on the same date and using the same procedure as that of the corresponding assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity. Should the entity once more operate in an inflationary economic environment, the cumulative effects of inflation not recognized in the periods where the environment was deemed to be non-inflationary should be recognized retrospectively. Except as otherwise indicated, all data in the financial statements included below in Item 18 (which together with the attached notes constitute our “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and the selected financial information included throughout this Form 20-F (this “Annual Report”) have been presented in nominal pesos for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2010, except for year 2007 that is expressed in constant pesos for the year ended December 31, 2007. Mexican FRS differs in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). For a discussion of certain significant differences between Mexican FRS and U.S. GAAP as they apply to us, together with a reconciliation of consolidated operating income, consolidated net income, consolidated stockholders’ equity to U.S. GAAP, and a consolidated statement of cash flows under U.S. GAAP, see Note 23 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The effect of price-level restatement under Mexican FRS has not been reversed in the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. See Note 23 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. 1 In January 2009, the Mexican Banking and Securities Commission (Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, “CNBV”) published certain amendments to the Rules for Public Companies and other participants in the Mexican Securities Market (Disposiciones de Caracter General Aplicables a las Emisoras de Valores y a otros Participantes del Mercado de Valores – the “Rules”) that require public companies to report financial information in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), effective as of January 1, 2012. On January 1, 2012, we adopted IFRS, meeting the CNBV requirements. The Company must release its first quarter, 2012 unaudited results under IFRS, no later than May 2, 2012. IFRS differs in certain significant respects from Mexican FRS. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the principal differences among IFRS and Mexican FRS as they apply to us. References herein to “U.S. dollars,” “U.S. $” or “$” are to the lawful currency of the United States of America, except that "$" is also used for pesos in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. References herein to “pesos” or “Ps.” are to the lawful currency of Mexico. This Annual Report contains translations of certain peso amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise indicated, such U.S. dollar amounts have been translated from pesos at an exchange rate of Ps 13.97 to US $1.00, the exchange rate on December 31, 2011. As used herein, the term “tons” refers to metric tons of 1,000 kilograms (equal to 2,204.6 pounds) and the term “billion” refers to one thousand million (1,000,000,000). One square meter is equivalent to 10.764 square feet. Market Data This Annual Report contains certain statistical information regarding the Mexican chicken, beef, egg, balanced feed (or “feed”), turkey and swine markets and our market share. We have obtained this information from a variety of sources, including the producers’ associations Union Nacional de Avicultores (the National Poultry Union or the “UNA”), Consejo Nacional Agropecuario (the National Agricultural Council or “CNA”); Consejo Mexicano de Porcicultura (the Mexican Pork Council or “CMP”), as well as Banco de Mexico (the Central Bank), Secretaria de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentos (“Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing and Food” or “SAGARPA”) and publications of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The producers’ associations rely principally on data provided by their members. Information for which no source is cited was prepared by us on the basis of our knowledge of the Mexican chicken, egg, feed, turkey and swine markets and the wide variety of information available regarding these markets. The methodology and terminology used by different sources are not always consistent, and data from different sources are not readily comparable. Forward-Looking Statements We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements in our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (or “SEC”) on Forms 20-F and 6-K, in our annual report to stockholders, in offering circulars and prospectuses, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by one of our officers, directors or employees to analysts, institutional investors, representatives of the media and others. 2 Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) projections of revenues, income (or loss), earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items or ratios; (ii) statements of our plans, objectives or goals or those of our management, including those relating to new contracts; (iii) statements about future economic performance; and (iv) statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “forecast,” “guideline,” “should” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of unexpected changes could cause actual results to deviate from our plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions. We recognize that the accuracy of our predictions and our ability to follow through on our intentions depend on factors beyond our control. The potential risks are many and varied, but include unexpected changes in: economic, weather and political conditions; raw material prices; competitive conditions; and demand for chicken, eggs, turkey, balanced feed, beef and swine.

Key Information A.Selected Financial Data The financial information set forth below is derived from our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in Item 18. We provide details on the figures and year-to-year changes in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. In preparing our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, we followed Mexican FRS, which differ in certain respects from U.S. GAAP. Note 23 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements provides a description of the main differences between Mexican FRS and U.S. GAAP as they apply to us, a reconciliation from Mexican FRS to U.S. GAAP of total stockholders’ equity, net income, and a condensed statement of cash flows under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The table set below presents our key financial information. Except as otherwise indicated the amounts are presented in millions of nominal pesos for years ended December 31, 2008 through 2011, and in constant pesos for the year ended December 31, 2007. 3 In millions of U.S. dollars Income Statement Data 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2011 (1) Mexican FRS: Net revenues Ps.18,219.6 Ps.20,125.3 Ps.23,262.9 Ps.24,715.5 Ps.27,735.0 US. $1,985.3 Cost of sales 14,477.9 17,482.5 19,326.8 19,500.7 24,773.2 1,773.3 Gross profit 3,741.8 2,642.9 3,936.1 5,214.8 2,961.8 212.0 Operating income 1,496.3 230.1 1,413.8 2,463.0 9.9 0.7 Comprehensive financing income (loss) 19.1 (1,369.2) (133.2) 122.1 177.6 12.7 Net controlling interest income (loss) 1,270.9 (879.0) 797.6 1,983.4 157.0 11.2 Net consolidated income (loss) per Share(2) 2.1 (1.5) 1.3 3.3 0.27 0.02 Net consolidated income (loss) per ADS(3) 25.4 (17.5) 16.0 39.7 3.18 0.23 Dividends per Share(4) 0.59 0.59 0.42 0.42 0.50 0.04 Weighted average Shares outstanding (thousands) 600,000 600,000 600,000 600,000 600,000 600,000 U.S. GAAP: Net revenues Ps.18,219.6 Ps.20,125.3 Ps.23,262.9 Ps.24,715.5 Ps.27,735.0 1,985.3 Operating income 1,481.0 185.6 1,391.0 2,400.3 (8.5) (0.6) Net controlling interest income (loss) 1,261.9 (869.4) 787.0 1,975.0 1,178.6 84.4 Statement of Financial Position Data Mexican FRS: Cash and cash equivalents(6) Ps.3,039.9 Ps.1,998.2 Ps.2,399.1 Ps.3,967.9 Ps. 2,625.7 188.0 Primary financial instruments 0.0 0.0 151.8 209.3 410.7 29.4 Total assets 19,116.4 19,455.0 19,877.9 21,197.8 23,169.9 1,658.5 Short-term debt(5) 58.8 234.2 591.9 139.9 1,453.0 104.0 Long-term debt 50.8 391.7 372.0 507.1 384.4 27.5 Total stockholders’ equity 15,127.2 14,079.4 14,638.5 16,368.4 16,269.1 1,164.6 Capital Stock 2,294.9 2,294.9 2,294.9 2,294.9 2,294.9 164.3 U.S. GAAP: Total controlling interest equity 15,071.7 13,786.7 14,329.2 16,052.8 17,017.4 1,218.1 Selected Operating Data Sales volume (thousands of tons): Chicken 837.2 878.1 918.1 983.9 1,072.7 Eggs 147.8 143.6 143.4 141.9 133.2 Balanced Feed 438.8 370.7 337.9 327.5 378.8 Swine and Others 16.1 18.8 19.0 20.0 21.6 Margins (Mexican FRS) Gross margin (%) 20.5% 13.1% 16.9% 21.1% 10.7% Operating margin (%) 8.2% 1.1% 6.1% 10.0% 0.0% Consolidated net margin (%) 7.0% (4.4)% 3.5% 8.0% 0.6% Total employees 23,088 23,248 24,065 23,473 25,326 (1) Peso amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars, solely for the convenience of the reader, at the rate of Ps.13.97 per U.S. dollar.

The chart below includes Mexican gross domestic product (“GDP”) and Inflation Rate data from 2007 to 2011, as provided by the Central Bank, and the average interest rates on 28-day Mexican treasury bills (“CETES”), as provided by the Central Bank. Year GDP Inflation Rate CETES 2007 3.3% 3.80% 7.2% 2008 1.3% 6.50% 7.6% 2009 (6.5%) 3.57% 5.4% 2010 5.5% 4.40% 4.4% 2011 3.9% 3.82% 4.3% On April 17, 2012, the 28-day Cetes rate was 4.33%. 4 Exchange Rates In 2007, the Mexican peso remained reasonably stable in its peso-dollar exchange rate. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the peso depreciated with respect to the U.S. dollar by 1.1% at year-end. The average value of the Mexican peso was 0.2% lower than the average of 2006. In 2008, the exchange rate of the peso against the U.S. dollar was highly volatile. While during the first half of the year, the Mexican peso strengthened its position with respect to the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso experienced a steep depreciation during the second half of the year and the peso-dollar exchange rate at year-end had depreciated by 21.0% with respect to December 31, 2007. During 2009, although the Mexican peso-dollar exchange rate depreciated during the first half of 2009, the peso stabilized and strengthened its position in the second half of 2009, leading the Mexican peso-dollar exchange rate to appreciate 5.4% in 2009 with respect to the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2008. In 2010, the Mexican peso strengthened its position during the year as compared to the dollar, appreciating approximately 5.3% since the end of 2009, while the inflation rate for 2010 was 4.40%. During the first half of 2011, the exchange rate of the peso to the dollar was stable, showed an average rate of Ps.11.89 per one dollar. This stability changed drastically during the second half of the year, were we observed a higher average rate peso-dollar of Ps.12.97, with a final depreciation of 13.0% by the end of the year with respect to year-end of 2010. The following table sets forth the high, low, average and year-end exchange rates for the purchase and sale of US dollars (presented in each case as the average between such purchase and sale rates) for periods indicated: Exchange Rate(1) In Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar Yearly High Low Average(2) Year end 2007 11.27 10.67 10.93 10.92 2008 13.94 9.92 11.14 13.83 2009 15.41 12.63 13.50 13.08 2010 13.19 12.16 12.62 12.38 2011 14.25 11.51 12.43 13.95(3) Monthly October 2011 13.93 13.10 13.44 13.17 November 2011 14.25 13.38 13.70 13.62 December 2011 13.99 13.49 13.77 13.95 January 2012 13.75 12.93 13.38 13.04 February 2012 12.95 12.63 12.78 12.79 March 2012 12.99 12.63 12.75 12.81 (1) The exchange rates are the noon buying rates in New York City for cable transfers in pesos as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “noon buying rate”). (2) Average of month-end rates for each period shown. (3) The exchange rate for the year end for the Banco de Mexico was Ps.13.97 per one dollar. On April 13, 2011, the exchange rate for cable transfers in pesos as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was Ps.13.1460 per $1.00 US dollar. 5 B.Capitalization and Indebtedness Not applicable C.Reasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds Not Applicable D.Risk Factors Risks Related to Economic Conditions Mexican economic and other conditions, as well as economic and market conditions in other countries, may negatively affect our business, results of operations and the market value of our securities. If the Mexican economy experiences decreased output in a recession, or if inflation or interest rates significantly increase, consumers may not be able to purchase our products. These and other effects could have adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and results of operations. High interest rates in Mexico could adversely affect our costs. Our earnings may also be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable-rate debt instruments and may benefit from the interest we earn on our cash balance. Our market value (through the trading of our shares listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange (or “BMV”) and our American Depositary Shares (or “ADSs”), listed at the New York Stock Exchange (or “NYSE”), may be affected by economic and market conditions arising in any other countries. Even when economic conditions in such countries may differ significantly from economic conditions in Mexico, investors’ reactions to developments in any of these other countries may have an adverse effect on the Mexican securities. Consequently, the market value of our securities may be adversely affected by events taking place outside of Mexico. Political events in México, including transition to a new presidential administration, could affect Mexican economic policy and our operations In July 2012, we will have presidential elections. We cannot predict the impact of this event in future business conditions in México. Presidential elections may result in government gridlock and political uncertainty, which could have an adverse effect on Mexican economic policy and as a result, to affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Depreciation or fluctuation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our financial conditions, results of operations and the market price of our shares and ADSs. The largest component of our cost of sales is the balanced feed. The main components of the balanced feed are corn and soybean meal. We buy an important percentage of grains in the U.S., priced in U.S. dollars. In addition, the price of grain we purchase in Mexico may be influenced by U.S. commodity markets. In addition, severe devaluation or depreciation of the peso may also result in disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may limit our ability to transfer or to convert pesos into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness and some accounts payable. 6 Therefore, if the peso falls relative to the U.S. dollar, the cost of our balanced feed, some accounts payable due and our debt payments would increase. Furthermore, currency fluctuations will probably continue to affect our revenues and expenses. Finally, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the peso and the U.S. dollar will also affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the peso price of our shares (the “shares” or “Serie B Shares”) in the BMV and the price of American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) on the NYSE. Because we pay cash dividends in pesos, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by holders of American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) upon conversion of such cash dividends by The Bank of New York Mellon, our Depositary Bank. U.S. and Other Economies Worldwide Events affecting the U.S. economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations, prospects financial condition and our market value. Economic conditions in Mexico are heavily influenced by global economic conditions, mainly the U.S. economy. This is due to various factors, such as the commercial trade pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). Events and conditions affecting the U.S. economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition. U.S. economy slowdown may also negatively affect the results of our U.S. operation, since the demand and prices of chicken product in U.S. market depends partially on the global economic growth. Investor’s reactions to economic conditions present in other economies worldwide, even when economic conditions in those countries may differ significantly from economic conditions in Mexico, may have an adverse effect in our stock. Consequently, our market value may be adversely affected by current events in other countries. Risks Relating to the Food Industry Future cyclicality excess supply and downturns within the chicken industry may adversely affect our results. The chicken industry in Mexico and the U.S., as well as the chicken industry in other countries, has been characterized by a long-term decline in prices in real terms. The industry has undergone cyclical periods of higher prices and profitability, followed by overproduction, leading to periods of lower prices and profitability. The market that we serve is subject to volatility with respect to supply, which affects prices. We cannot assure you that future cyclicality, excess supply and downturns in real prices will not adversely affect our results. 7 Increase in the price of feed ingredients and its volatility may adversely affect or margins and results of operations The largest single component of our cost of sales is the cost of ingredients used to prepare balanced feed, including: sorghum, soybean meal, corn, fish meal, meat meal and, for certain chicken products, marigold extract, among others. The price of most of these raw materials is subject to significant volatility resulting from weather conditions, the size of harvests, governmental agricultural policies, currency exchange rates, transportation, storage costs, and other factors. Given the long-term declining trends in real chicken prices, we may experience difficulty or delays in passing through any increase in grain costs to our customers. Accordingly, increases in the prices of the main raw materials used in the preparation of feed may have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations. Furthermore, the cost of corn in the U.S. may be affected by an increase in the demand of ethanol, which can reduce the supply of corn in the U.S. market, adversely affecting our operations in the U.S. Raising animals and meat processing involve animal health and disease control risks, which can have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our operations in Mexico and in the U.S. depend on raising animals and meat processing, which are subject to risks such as diseases and contamination. Live chickens and swine are susceptible to infections by a variety of microbiological agents. In the past we have experienced outbreaks of various diseases that have resulted in higher mortality rates than our average mortality rates. Chicken, turkey, beef and eggs are subject to contamination during processing or distribution. To reduce contamination, we use specialized feedstock and nutritional supplements that have been approved by the competent authorities and meet international industry standards, among some other measures. However, potential contamination during processing, however, could affect a larger number of our products, which may have a significant impact on our results. Additionally, our sales are entirely dependent on consumer preferences, and the loss of consumer confidence in the products sold by meat and egg producers as a result of disease, contamination or other reasons, even if not related to our own products, could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions may result in additional losses of inventory and damage to our plants and equipment. Natural disasters could significantly damage our facilities. Our facilities in Mexico are susceptible mainly to earthquakes and hurricanes. Our facilities near Mexico’s coast are most vulnerable to the risk of severe weather. Our U.S. facilities are located in Arkansas and Oklahoma, a region vulnerable to being hit by tornadoes. Extensive damage to these facilities could affect our ability to conduct our regular production, as a result, reduce our operation results. Increased competition may adversely affect our performance. Both in Mexico and in the U.S. we face significant competition from other chicken producers in all of our geographic markets and product lines. According to the UNA, we are Mexico’s largest chicken producer, but we face competition from other producers in all of the markets in which we sell our products. Each of the two other major chicken producers in Mexico has substantial financial resources and strengths in particular product lines and regions. 8 Our operations in the U.S. face significant competition from other chicken producers in all of our geographic markets and product lines. According to the WATTPoultry USA ranking of U.S. poultry companies for 2010(©Copyright 2012 WATT Publishing Co. all rights reserved), our U.S. operations produced 2.1% of the total ready to cook pounds produced in the U.S. The top two companies in the U.S. produced 38.5% and the top ten produced 74.5%. Each of the top two companies in the U.S. has substantial financial resources and strengths in particular product lines and regions. We also face competition from other companies in the markets in which we sell our products. We expect to continue to face strong competition in every market, as our existing or new competitors are likely to broaden their product lines and extend their geographic markets. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our performance will not be adversely affected by increased competition. Elimination of tariff barriers may adversely affect our performance Since 2003, chicken (excluding leg quarters for which the Mexican government imposed some temporary restrictions), eggs and swine import quotas were eliminated through the NAFTA. Poultry producers in the United States have developed extremely low-cost production methods and have been successful in exporting primarily frozen and value-added poultry to other countries, especially in periods of overcapacity in the United States. As tariff barriers decline under NAFTA, U.S. producers can be expected to increase exports to Mexico, which could have a material adverse effect on our performance. On January 1, 2008, the restrictions for leg quarters were phased out. At present there are no restrictions on exporting these products to Mexico. In February 2011, the Mexican Secretaria of Economy initiated an antidumping investigation focusing exclusively on imports of leg and thigh meat for human consumption from the United States of America to Mexico. This investigation was requested by Bachoco and by two other Mexican poultry companies. On January, 2012 the Mexican Ministry of Economy (or “Ministry of Economy”) issued a preliminary ruling on the anti-dumping process regarding chicken leg quarters imported to Mexico from the United States. On its press releases the Ministry of Economy stated the following: ·There are dumping conditions on chicken leg quarters imported from the United States, including margins ranging from 62.90% to 129.77%. ·These practices damaged the Mexican poultry industry. ·The Ministry of Economy has all the elements for requiring anti-dumping duties, but did not proceed as the interested parties expressed the will to reach an agreement. ·The antidumping practices investigation process with regards to chicken leg-quarters price discrimination will continue. ·The Ministry agreed to establish a 30 business day period for the interested parties to provide additional arguments or elements deemed relevant to the investigation. As of the date of this report, we do not have any further information regarding this matter. Risks Relating to Investors The Robinson Bours family owns 82.75% of our total shares outstanding and their interests may differ from other security holders. 9 The Robinson Bours family has established two Mexican trusts, which they control (“Control Trusts”), that together held 496,500,000 Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011. With that percentage they hold the power to elect a majority of the members of our Board of Directors and have the power to determine the outcome of certain other actions requiring the approval of our stockholders, including whether or not dividends are to be paid and the amount of such dividends. The prevailing market prices for the ADS’s and the Shares could decline if the Robinson Bours family sold substantial amounts of their Shares, whether directly, or indirectly, through the Mexican trusts through which they hold their Shares, or if the perception arose that such a sale could occur. The market value of our securities may be affected by economic and market conditions prevailing in any other country, although economic conditions in such countries may differ significantly from economic conditions in Mexico, Investors’ reactions to developments in any of these other countries may have an adverse perception and consequently, the market value of our securities may be adversely affected by events elsewhere. The protection afforded to minority stockholders in Mexico is different from that in the United States Under Mexican law, the protection afforded to minority stockholders is different from those in the United States. In particular, the law concerning fiduciary duties of directors is not well developed, there is no procedure for class actions or stockholder derivative actions, and there are different procedural requirements for bringing stockholder lawsuits. As a result, in practice it may be more difficult for the minority stockholders of Bachoco to enforce their rights against us or our directors or our controlling stockholder than it would be for stockholders of a U.S. company. Our bylaws restrict the ability of non-Mexican stockholders to invoke the protection of their governments with respect to their rights as stockholders As required by Mexican law, our bylaws provide that non-Mexican stockholders shall be considered as Mexicans with respect to their ownership interests in Bachoco and shall be deemed to have agreed not to invoke the protection of their governments in certain circumstances. Under this provision, a non-Mexican stockholder is deemed to have agreed not to invoke the protection of its own government by asking such government to interpose a diplomatic claim against the Mexican government with respect to the stockholder’s rights as a stockholder, but is not deemed to have waived any other rights it may have, including any rights under the U.S. securities laws, with respect to its investment in Bachoco. If you invoke such governmental protection in violation of this agreement, your Shares could be forfeited to the Mexican government. Our bylaws may only be enforced in Mexico Our bylaws provide that legal actions relating to the execution, interpretation or performance of the bylaws may be brought only in Mexican courts. As a result, it may be difficult for non-Mexican stockholders to enforce their stockholder rights pursuant to the bylaws. It may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities against us or our directors, officers and controlling persons We are organized under the laws of Mexico, and most of our directors, officers and controlling persons reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process within the United States on such persons or to enforce judgments against them. This pertains also to any action based on civil liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws. There is doubt as to the enforceability against such persons in Mexico, whether in original actions or in actions to enforce judgments of U.S. courts, of liabilities based solely on the U.S. federal securities laws. 10 Non-Mexican stockholders may not be entitled to participate in future preemptive rights offerings Under Mexican law and our bylaws, if we issue new Shares for cash as part of a capital increase, we must grant our stockholders the right to purchase a sufficient number of Shares to maintain their existing ownership percentage in the Company (“preemptive rights”). We can allow holders of ADSs in the United States to exercise preemptive rights in any future capital increase only in one of the following two circumstances: (i) we file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to that future issuance of Shares; or (ii) the offering qualifies for an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. We make no promises that we will file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow holders of ADSs in the United States to participate in a preemptive rights offering. As a result, the equity interests of such holders in the Company may be diluted proportionately. In addition, under current Mexican law, it is not practicable for the depositary to sell preemptive rights and distribute the proceeds from such sales to ADS holders. Corporate disclosure and accounting in Mexico may differ from other countries There may be less, or different, publicly available information about issuers of securities in Mexico than is regularly published by or about issuers of securities in other countries with highly developed capital markets. In addition, due to country-by-country differences in accounting and other reporting principles and standards, our corporate disclosures may differ in content from disclosures made under other principles and standards, such as U.S. GAAP. However, we adopted IFRS starting January 1, 2012. ITEM
