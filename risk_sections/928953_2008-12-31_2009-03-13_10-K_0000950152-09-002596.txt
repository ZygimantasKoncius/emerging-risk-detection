Item 1A. Risk Factors. This annual report contains historical information, as well as forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and relate to future events, our future financial performance, or our expected future operations and actions. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, future, intend, could, hope, predict, target, potential, or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are only our predictions based upon current information and involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our actual results or actions may differ materially from these forward-looking statements for many reasons. While it is impossible to identify all of theses factors, the following could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by us:  worsening of national economic conditions, including continuation of lack of liquidity in the capital markets and more stringent lending requirements by financial institutions;  depressed values for commercial real estate properties and companies;  changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics;  changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage funds;  impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws;  ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older properties;  more attractive lease incentives offered by competitors in similar markets;  increased market demand for newer properties;  changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses;  decreases in market prices of the shares of publicly traded real estate companies;  adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies;  adverse changes in zoning laws; and  other factors which are beyond our control. 3 Table of Contents In addition, an investment in the Company involves numerous risks that potential investors should consider carefully, including, without limitation:  we have no operating assets;  our cash resources are limited;  we have a history of losses;  we have not raised funds through a public equity offering;  our trustees control a significant percentage of our voting shares;  shareholders could experience possible future dilution through the issuance of additional shares;  we are dependent on a small number of key senior professionals who are part-time employees; and  we currently do not plan to distribute dividends to the holders of our shares.
