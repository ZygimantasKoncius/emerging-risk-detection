D. Risk Factors – Risks Associated with the Mining Industry – The estimates of mineral reserves and forecasts of the production are subject to numerous uncertainties, and the production and recovery of reserve estimates appearing in the Annual Report may not be realized” for a discussion of the risks inherent in estimating reserves and production. Technical Parameters The main parameters used to estimate mineral reserves and mineral resources are as follows: A cut-off grade of 3.75 g/t Au estimated using a gold price of US$1,225 per ounce and an exchange rate of CAN$1.06/US$1.00; Grades were capped at 75 g/t Au for all zones, with the exception of Island Gold deep C and B zones, where 95 g/t was used, while all other Island Gold Deep zones were capped at 40 g/t; A minimum true thickness of 2.0 metres based on the mining method (longitudinal long holes); An average rock density of 2.82 t/m3 is defined, 2.80 t/m3 for Island Gold Deep zones; 59 Ore mining recovery: 95% for designed stopes - pillars between stopes have been excluded; External dilution: an average dilution rate of 19% of waste at a grade of 0.5 g/t Au is assumed for stopes. A dilution rate of 30% is assumed for development; Excluded mill recovery of approximately 95%. Estimation Methods At the Island Gold Mine, the Gemcom GEMS 6.3.1 software was used to prepare the resource estimation. The reserve and resources estimates were calculated following two distinct methods. Reserve estimation was done with block model using an inverse distance to the power 2 calculation for Island Main, Lochalsh and Goudreau sectors and also Island Gold Deep D, D1, E1E, G and G1 zones.Ordinary Kriging has been used for Extension 1 and 2 as well as for Island Gold Deep C and B zones. The polygonal method was used for Extension 3 resource estimation. Regardless of the methods used, composites were established by the geological department for each drill hole and underground development face. The diamond drill hole composites were determined following an interpretation on vertical cross-sections and horizontal plans while the development composites were interpreted using the face mapping and assay results of each development face. Once individual composites were determined, each one was tagged in the database according to their individual zone name. Individual pierce points were generated on longitudinal sections for each zone. These longitudinal sections are a representation of an average plane through each mineralized zone. For the polygonal method, construction of the polygons is completed on longitudinal sections. An area of influence of 20 metres was determined for the development composite and the diamond drill holes. A 10 metre influence was used on the lateral extremities of the development composite to limit their influence. When all polygons are generated, a combination of the development and drill hole pierce points is created. After the ore block limits are determined and the grade and tonnes of each reserve block are calculated, specific dilution and ore recovery are factored into the final reserve estimate. All the geo-scientific data collected at the Island Gold Mine are entered into a Gemcom database. Internal procedures have been prepared in order to validate the information in the database. All this work is performed by the Island Gold Mine geology department and all steps, from data entry to layout drawings, follow strict and established procedures, including crosschecks to ensure full validity. Access to all databases is restricted to selected personnel in order to ensure complete integrity. Cut-off Grade The cut-off for stopes was established at 3.75 g/t Au. This cut-off was calculated using, among other things, 2013 production costs and anticipated 2014 production costs. Reserve Classification More detailed descriptions regarding classification of mineral reserves at the Island Gold Mine are set out below. Proven Mineral Reserves Ore development was completed above, below or on both levels of the ore block. If only one level was developed, a minimum drill spacing of 20 metres was necessary to confirm the vein continuity. An economic feasibility was estimated by the engineering department of the Island Gold Mine to validate the block as reserves. 60 Probable Mineral Reserves No development was done above or below. Since the information from the ore development was lacking, a maximum drill hole spacing of 20 metres center to center was necessary to validate the vein continuity inside the ore block. Economic feasibility was estimated by the engineering department of the Island Gold Mine to validate the block as reserves. Dilution and mining recovery rates are included in the reserve estimation. Reserve Table As of December 31, 2013, the mineral reserves of the Island Gold Mine are estimated at: Reserve Categories Tonnes Grade Au1 (metric) (g/t Au) (oz) Proven 251,572 5.95 48,086 Probable 481,775 6.16 95,419 Total (Proven + Probable) 733,347 6.09 143,505 • Before mill recovery of 95% As of December 31, 2013, the mineral reserves at Island Gold were 143,505 ounces of gold, calculated using a long-term gold price of CAN$1,300 per ounce, an exchange rate of CAN$1.06=US$1.00, and an expected mine life of approximately three years. Mining Operations and Metallurgy The extraction method is by longitudinal long holes with a maximum panel length fixed by a hydraulic radius factor of 4.5. The Island Gold ore is hauled by truck to the Kremzar mill located at an approximate distance of 0.8 km from the portal of the ramp. The Kremzar mill is a traditional gold recovery mill using a conventional Carbon in Pulp (“CIP”) process, with circuits for crushing, grinding, gold cyanidation and carbon-in-pulp and two electrowinning (“EW”) cells. Gold recovery of the CIP circuit at the Kremzar mill is approximately 95%. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, 35,113 ounces of gold were sold at an average price of CAN$1,434 (US$1,392) per ounce. This compared to 2012, during which 41,686 ounces of gold were sold at an average price of CAN$1,665 (US$1,666) per ounce. Cash costs at Island Gold increased to CAN$1,124 (US$1,092) in 2013 from CAN$884 (US$884) in 2012, primarily a reflection of the decrease in recovered grade and higher costs per tonne due to higher surface, administrative and milling costs year over year, which was mainly attributable to mechanical problems at the mill during the second quarter of 2013 that necessitated the short-term rental of equipment from an outside supplier. 61 2013 2012 2011 Revenues (thousands of CAN$) 50,487 69,631 76,456 Ounces sold 35,113 41,686 49,196 Data per ounce of gold sold US$ CAN$ US$ CAN$ US$ CAN$ Cash cost 1,092 1,124 884 884 766 758 Depreciation and depletion 221 228 181 181 161 159 Total 1,313 1,352 1,065 1,065 927 917 Average price obtained per ounce 1,392 1,434 1,666 1,665 1,566 1,549 4.

Detail information on the Francoeur property is presented as residual ore was milled and gold ounces were produced in 2013. Financial results of the Francoeur Mine are presented as a discontinued operation on the Corporation financial statements. Location and Property Description The Francoeur property is located 25 km west of Rouyn-Noranda, Abitibi, Beauchastel Township, ranges IV and V, lots 1 to 9. 62 Description of Mining Rights The Francoeur property consists of 16 mining claims, 3 mining concessions and 5 mining leases totalling approximately 505 ha. Number of mining titles Area Expiration date (ha) 16 mining claims 170.57 Claims expire between 04/24/2014 and 10/05/2015 3 mining concessions 230.21 Mining concessions 194, 322 and 326: 01/31/2015 5 mining leases 103.95 Mining leases 776, 825, 826 ,849 and 1006 expire between 09/07/2015 and 06/26/2032 24 504.73 All of these claims are expected to be renewed before the anniversary date by applying excess credits available or by the execution of the required works. For the mining leases, taxes are paid to the government every year to keep them in good standing. For mining concessions, geological work is performed to keep it in good standing and taxes are paid every year. Richmont Mines has an internal procedure and an external control to insure appropriate follow up regarding claim expiry dates. All the mining claims, mining concessions and mining leases were in good standing in 2013 and are expected to be for 2014. A mining lease was obtained for the West Zone area in 2012. Two claims were suspended following the reception of the mining lease, as a result of their area having been modified. A detailed list and map of locations can be found in the amended technical report for the Francoeur Gold Property as of August 17, 2012 filed under the Corporation’s profile on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com. Ownership of Mining Rights All mining titles on the Francoeur property are held by Richmont Mines. Mining Royalties There are no royalties or back-in-rights related to any of the mining claims, mining leases and mining concessions. Environmental Obligations and Permits Following the announcement of the end the mining activities, Richmont Mines stopped mine dewatering on March 18, 2013 and ceased mining operations on March 6, 2013 (within the meaning of federal regulations). Richmont has begun the preliminary cleaning and restoration work on this property. Environmental characterization will be carried out towards the beginning of the second quarter of 2014. Following this study, Richmont will validate the restoration to be completed, and will be able to submit a rehabilitation plan. Infrastructure The Francoeur property includes two vertical shafts with their headframes. The 477-metre shaft No.6 provided access to levels 4 to 11, and served thereafter for ventilation purposes. A machine shop, a core shack and a warehouse are regrouped in this same area. The 818-metre Jean-Guy Rivard shaft (No.7) is located 650 metres northeast of the No.6 shaft. The Jean-Guy Rivard shaft was sunk by Richmont Mines, giving access to six additional levels (12 to 17). The headframe also included a service building containing a covered ore bin, the main office and a dry room. A hoist room, an air compressors room, an electric room are grouped in this same area. 63 There are no mill facilities at the site, and accordingly, no mine tailings were left in place, except in the area of the old tailings between shaft No.1 and No.2 in the eastern part of the property. From 1993 to the end of mining activities in 2001, the ore was sent to Richmont Mines’ Camflo Mill in Malartic, Quebec. Waste contained 0.4% sulphur, and the material had a positive neutralizing potential and did not generate acidic drainage (H2SO4). Richmont Mines also used the Camflo Mill to treat the ore from the West Zone in 2012. Consequently, no mine tailings have been stored on the site. Only a non-acid generating waste stock pile is on the site. Location of Mineralized Zones The Francoeur No.3 deposit constitutes the main ore zone of the Francoeur property which was mined until 2001 down to the 17th level by Richmont Mines. The No.3 deposit is hosted in the metavolcanic rocks of the Blake River Group. Gold mineralization mainly developed in the ductile Francoeur-Wasa shear zone. The mineralized zone extends for at least 1,200 metres down dip from surface to beyond the 17th level. It is a composite orebody consisting of four distinct ore zones, three of which occur within the Francoeur-Wasa shear zone. The “West Zone” is located to the west of the No.3 deposit. It is composed of two zones, the Main Zone (West) and the Footwall Zone (FW), both located in the Francoeur-Wasa shear zone and dipping northward at about 30° to 40°. Gold-bearing mineralization is closely associated with albite-pyrite alteration. This zone apparently differs from the No.3 orebody by its apparent NW plunge instead of the NE plunge generally observed elsewhere. Accessibility The property is easily accessible by Provincial road 117 that joins Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, and the small community of Arntfield, Quebec. From there, a secondary road (Provencher Avenue North) leads northwest for 3.2 km to the Francoeur No.6 and Jean-Guy Rivard shafts. A number of gravel and bush roads crosscut the property over a few hundred metres in all directions. Climate The average temperatures are -17.2° C in January and +17.2° C in July based on measurements taken over 30 years in this area. There is an average monthly maximum of 61 cm of snowfall in December and 101.9 mm of rain in September. Local Resources and Infrastructure Rouyn-Noranda (pop. 41,475) is a well established mining community offering a vast amount of services. The Horne copper smelter is the most important employer with a workforce of more than 500. Hydro-Québec electric power is available on the mine site from an hydro line located along the access road and connected to a provincial hydro line which runs along Provincial Highway 117. The Ontario Northland Railway runs south of the property, parallel to Provincial Highway 117. Physiography The area straddles the coniferous and boreal zones. The forest cover is composed of 50% leafy and 50% resinous trees with moderate commercial value. The topography is relatively flat (285 m to 300 m) with the exception of the northeast corner of the property where outcrops are no more than 30 metres higher than the average level. 64 Exploration History The Francoeur property was staked for the first time in 1923 following a gold discovery which later became Zone 1. In 1932, Francoeur Gold Mines Ltd. sunk a 45° incline shaft (No.1) of approximately 226 metres with four levels (95, 191, 290 and 488 foot levels) in the footwall of Zone 1. In 1936, zones 2 and 3, located at more than 549 metres west of Zone 1, were discovered through drilling along the Francoeur-Wasa shear. Additionally, a 45° incline shaft (No.2) was sunk to a depth of 183 metres with four development levels (132, 221, 311 and 399 foot levels) in the lower footwall of Zone 2. In 1938, a 150 short ton per day concentrator was built on the property, and mining of both No.1 and No.2 deposits began immediately thereafter. In 1939, Zone 8 was discovered approximately 244 metres north of the Francoeur-Wasa shear. This zone was opened as early as 1940 through a cross-cut driven from the second level of Zone 2. On the third level, the drift was extended approximately 914 metres to the west to reach and mine the ore of Zone 3. Between August 1938 and March 1947, Francoeur Gold Mines Ltd. produced 94,303 ounces of gold from 520,363 tonnes of ore with a recovered grade of 5.6 g/t of gold (Brown, 1962). In July 1964, Francoeur Gold Mines Ltd. was acquired by Wright-Hargreaves Mines Ltd. (Wasamac Division). In 1965, after further drilling, the Wasamac No.2 vertical shaft (now called shaft No.6) was sunk by Wright-Hargreaves Mines Ltd. to a depth of 477 metres to mine the Zone 3 from the 4th to the 11th level. Mining operations started in May 1968 and ended in March 1971 for a total gold production of 69,227 ounces from 385,292 tonnes grading 5.6 g/t of gold (Karpoff, 1986). The ore was milled at the Wasamac No.1 mine concentrator located 6 km to the east. During 1973 and 1974, the property was optioned to Kerr Addison Mines Ltd. and Noranda Exploration Corporation Ltd. They drilled five holes along the Francoeur-Wasa shear zone with little success (GM 29431, GM 30512). Finally, exploration work, including three deep holes (FR-82-1, 2 and 17), was carried out from 1980 to 1984 by Long Lac Exploration Ltd. (GM 40041, GM 41362). In October 1985, Rouyn Mining Resources (“RMR”, now Richmont Mines) signed an option agreement with Lac Minerals to acquire a 50% interest on the Francoeur property. An assessment of the property was commissioned in order to evaluate the remaining resources left in place by Wright-Hargreaves. Karpoff (1986) evaluated that approximately 416,402 tonnes grading 7.54 g/t Au were still accessible by the Wasamac shaft No.2 (now shaft No.6). In the spring of 1986, RMR started the dewatering and the rehabilitation of the underground infrastructure. In 1986 and 1987, a total of 27,799 m of surface diamond drilling in 75 holes was carried out on zones 1, 2, 8 and below the 11th level of Zone 3. At the same time, surface facilities were installed and underground diamond drilling confirmed the previously reported in situ reserves. The surface diamond drilling program delineated more than 1 million tonnes of possible reserves under the 11th level of Zone 3. During the spring of 1988, RMR extracted a 23,111 tonne bulk sample grading 6.8 g/t Au from the No.3 deposit. The ore was successfully processed at Lac Minerals Ltd.’s mill located in Malartic, Quebec and mining operations from the No.6 shaft started the same year. Considering the shallow dip of the Zone 3 (42°N), it was then evaluated that it would be more profitable to sink a new shaft 650 m north of the No.6 shaft thereby giving access to the resources found under the lowest level (11th). As a result, the Jean-Guy Rivard (No.7) shaft was sunk in May 1989 to a final depth of 818 metres. In June 1991, RMR’s name was changed to Richmont Mines Inc. On October 1, 1991, development work was completed and commercial production began at a rate of 400 tonnes per day. From 1992 to 1994, production was increased from 500 tons to 800 tonnes per day. In June 1992, Richmont Mines acquired Lac Minerals’ 50% share of the Francoeur and Wasamac properties. 65 In 1993, Richmont Mines bought the Camflo Mill and began processing Francoeur’s ore. The ore was previously processed at East Malartic Mill (Quebec) and Deak Resources in Virginiatown, Ontario. The exploration program conducted at the Francoeur property in 1997 was successful in discovering Zone 7, which differed, in terms of dipping, from the No.3 deposit. This zone dipped south (70-75°) while the main gold-bearing structure dipped north (40-45°). Following the discovery of Zone 7, a major development program was undertaken in 1998. Rehabilitation work was done in shaft No.6 and access drifting and infill drilling commenced on levels 4, 6 and 7. In 1999, development work on levels 4, 6 and 7 and related sublevels were completed. Commercial production of Zone 7 resumed at the beginning of February 2000. From 1991 to 2001, the Francoeur Mine produced 1,701,892 tonnes of ore at a grade of 6.31 g/t (345,436 ounces of gold). In 2001, Richmont Mines conducted exploration work in the west part of the mine. A new resource was identified, the West Zone, but given the low gold price, the development work required to mine this resource made the project uneconomic. Subsequent to the closing of the mine in November 2001, Richmont Mines acquired the adjacent Norex property in February 2002. The 2002-2003 exploration drilling programs (7,801 m) successfully increased the West Zone mineral resources to 884,514 tonnes grading 7.9 g/t Au. However, the feasibility study demonstrated that any effort to resume production by deepening the Jean-Guy Rivard shaft would be marginally profitable at that time. The mine was subsequently flooded and restoration of the site began. Following the closure of the mine, minimal exploration work was conducted to keep the mining concessions and leases in good standing and only 4 exploration holes were drilled from surface between 2005 and 2007. The target was an auriferous shear subsidiary to the Francoeur-Wasa shear zone. As a result of higher gold prices, Richmont re-assessed the Francoeur resources and decided to proceed with an exploration program. An exploration drilling program was completed in 2009 with approximately 7,500 m of drilling. An NI 43-101 technical report was produced in 2009 and the dewatering of the mine was undertaken. At the end of 2009, 8 out of the mine’s 17 levels had been dewatered, and the surface infrastructure had been fully re-commissioned. The Corporation began drift excavation and underground mine preparation work on this property when dewatering of the mine was completed at the end of the second quarter of 2010. As of December 31, 2010, 1,239 metres of underground development had been completed. From 2010 to November 2012, 639 diamond drill holes were done over a total of 46,489 metres to define the West Zone. A new reserve and resource estimate was completed in June 2012 and a 43-101 technical report was filed on SEDAR on August 17, 2012. Furthermore, an exploration drift and rehabilitation work were done on levels 12 to 17, and the access ramp was completed between levels 16 and 17. The Francoeur Mine began commercial production on August 1, 2012. The ramp was being advanced below level 17 until the announcement of the mine closure on November 29, 2012. Geological Setting Regional Geology The property is located in the Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec area, a typical sector of the Archean aged Abitibi greenstone belt located in the eastern part of the Superior Province. The Superior Province is the largest exposed Archean craton in the world that hosts several world class gold deposits. It has yielded nearly 300 million ounces of gold from hundreds of deposits since the beginning of the twentieth century. 66 Project Geology The Francoeur property includes the Francoeur No.1, No.2 and No.3 deposits. They occur along the Francoeur-Wasa shear zone and, from east to west, together with the Arntfield No.1, No.2, and No.3 deposits, the Wasamac deposit and the Wingate deposit. Despite the showing of local differences, all of these deposits are very similar to one another in both geological aspects and types of mineralization. The Francoeur No.3 deposit was the largest one of them all. Mineralization The ore zones of the Francoeur deposits are generally made up of distinct lenticular and tabular bodies up to one metre in thickness, and form buff or beige coloured bands, called BB bands. All the BB bands are mainly composed of carbonate, albite, pyrite and minor amounts of quartz and rutile, with trace amounts of sericite and gold. There is no evidence of stratigraphic control on the gold deposition in the Francoeur property. Instead, the gold emplacement apparently developed in the shear zone and is partially related to albitite dikes. A similar lack of stratigraphic control was noted for deposits adjacent to the Cadillac Break in the Noranda district of Quebec. The nature of the contacts of gold ore bodies with enclosing mylonitic schist is quite variable. There are two types of basic contacts, one of which is faulted, while the other may be sharp or gradational. The BB bands display a wide variety of textures ranging from a foliated micro-breccia, to more common fine grained and very well laminated rock. They contain on average 20 to 40 g/t Au and the grade can reach 50 g/t Au locally. The gold is commonly in its native form and is very fine-grained. Gold grains are usually associated with small pyrite crystals, but a proportion is also disseminated in the finely recrystallized carbonate-albite matrix. 2012 Development In 2012, necessary developments were completed permitting the Francoeur Mine to begin commercial production on August 1, 2012. At the end of November 2012, the mine had 153 employees, an increase from the 119 employees at the end of 2011. At the announcement of the mine closure on November 29, 2012, mechanized sub-level 18-3 had been reached and ore development had been completed over several metres. A total of 4,107 metres of underground development and 23,567 metres of definition drilling were completed during 2012 at Francoeur. On November 29, 2012, the Corporation announced the immediate closure of the Francoeur Mine. Constant high production costs due to low gold grade, difficult mining conditions and the lack of experienced miners required to run the mine in those particular conditions, within a context in which management was not able to see significant improvements in the future, were the main factors which led to the decision to close the mine. Gold commercial production at the mine ceased on November 30, 2012 and the Corporation subsequently began the estimated 4 month closing process. Exploration A considerable amount of exploration and development work has been carried out on the Francoeur property since the discovery of the first gold-bearing veins in the 1920’s. Richmont Mines has carried out major underground exploration programs along extensions of known mining blocks. Methodology Generally, most of the boreholes at the Francoeur deposit were set-up on transversal sections allowing them to intersect mineralized zones at a right angle. Off-section holes were drilled when underground openings were not available. 67 Exploration programs were generally split into two categories: 20 m x 30 m spaced exploration holes; 10 m x 15 m spaced definition holes. For the West Zone, because exploration boreholes were set-up in the footwall of the mineralized zones, they crosscut them at a very acute angle. For example, borehole R-882B started at a dip of -46° and finished 697.08 m deeper at a dip of 0°. The West Zone, which dips 42° north, was intersected over 9.90 m along the core (from 547.80 to 557.70 m and represents, in fact, a horizontal width of 2.64 m or a true thickness of 1.70 m). Definition drilling done in the West Zone was planned to intersect as perpendicularly as possible the mineralized zone. The drilling spacing can go down to 10 m x 15 m in certain areas. Sampling The rock sampling methods used underground were core drilling, wall sampling and rock blasting. Borehole and wall sampling assay results were used to determine the grade of mining blocks. Muck samples were taken from blasted ore in wagons transporting gold-bearing mineralization to the ore pass. These samples were used in the grade reconciliations and in estimations of reserves. Grades from development work and active stopes were compiled on a monthly basis and transferred to sections and plan views. Grade values were assigned to that part of development work carried out during the current month. Specific procedures had to be followed during the sampling process, as each sample for every 12 tons of ore had to be representative of the broken rock. Two sampling methods were applied at the Francoeur property: (1) Core sampling: sample lengths of exploration holes with varying geological parameters such as, for example, the amount of sulphides on both walls of a vein. The core of exploration holes was split in half with a diamond saw blade leaving a remaining sample as a reference for any subsequent detailed studies. Rejects were stored three months at the assay lab and, after that period of time, they were available for shipping to the client upon request. When mineral resources were found by any exploration program, a definition drilling program was initiated to verify the repeatability of the grades and better define the geometry of the orebody. Core from definition holes were analyzed entirely. (2) Muck sampling: several sampling procedures were applied in the past at the Francoeur property. The most widely used method was the sampling of trams, comprised of the following procedures: Collecting two handfuls of muck of every size per 4-ton tram (4 tons) or three handfuls per 5-ton tram, avoiding grabbing fine material; The collected material should be randomly taken and be representative of the whole tram; Samples should be collected at the ore pass; One sample bag should weigh a minimum of 6 pounds and represent the muck from 4 wagons or 16 to 20 tonnes; and There is a tag number for each bag and the sampling book should contain the following information: date of sampling, level, stope identification, number of sampled wagons and sampler initials. 68 Assays Expert Laboratory of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec was the laboratory used for sample assaying in 2012. The sampling and assaying procedures of Expert Laboratory are: Sample Preparation 1. Receiving Samples Upon receipt, samples are placed in numerical order and compared with the client packing list to verify receipt of all samples. If the client does not provide a packing list with the shipment, one will be prepared by the person unpacking the samples. If the samples received do not correspond to the client list, the client will be notified. 2. Sample Preparation Samples are dried if necessary and then reduced to -1/4 inch with a jaw crusher. The jaw crusher is cleaned with compressed air and barren material between sample batches. The sample is then reduced to 90% -10 mesh with a roll crusher. The roll crusher is cleaned between samples with a wire brush and compressed air and barren material between sample batches. The first sample of each sample batch is screened at 10 mesh to determine that 90% passes 10 mesh. Should 90% not pass, the roll crusher is adjusted and another test is done. Screen test results are recorded in the log book provided for this purpose. The sample is then riffled using a Jones type riffle to approximately 300 g. Excess material is stored for the client as a crusher reject. The 300 g portion is pulverized to 90% -200 mesh in a ring and puck type pulverizer, and the pulverizer is cleaned between samples with compressed air and silica sand between batches. The first sample of each batch is screened at 200 mesh to determine that 90% passes 200 mesh. Should 90% not pass, the pulverizing time is increased and another test is done. Screen test results are recorded in the log book provided for this purpose. Gold fire assay geochem A 29.166 g sample is weighed in a crucible that has been previously charged with approximately 130 g of flux. The sample is then mixed and 1 mg of silver nitrate is added. The sample is then fused at 1,800º F for approximately 45 minutes. The sample is then poured into a conical mold and allowed to cool. After cooling, the slag is broken off and the lead button weighing 25 – 30 g is recovered. This lead button is then cupelled at 1,600º F until all the lead is oxidized. After cooling, the dore bead is placed in a 12 X 75 mm test tube. 0.2 ml of 1:1 nitric acid is added and allowed to react in a water bath for 30 minutes. 0.3 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid is then added and allowed to react in the water bath for 30 minutes. The sample is then removed from the water bath and 4.5 ml of distilled water is added. The sample is thoroughly mixed, allowed to settle and the gold is determined by atomic absorption. Each furnace batch is comprised of 28 samples that include a reagent blank and gold standard. Crucibles are not reused until the result of the sample that was previously in each crucible has been obtained. Crucibles that have had gold values of 200 ppb are discarded. The lower detection limit is 5 ppb and samples assaying over 1,000 ppb are checked gravimetrically. 69 Gold fire assay gravimetric A 29.166 g sample is weighed in a crucible that has been previously charged with approximately 130 g of flux. The sample is then mixed and 2 g of silver nitrate is added. The sample is then fused at 1,800º F for approximately 45 minutes. The sample is then poured in a conical mold and allowed to cool. After cooling, the slag is broken off and the lead button weighing 25 – 30 g is recovered. This lead button is then cupelled at 1,600º F until all the lead is oxidized. After cooling, the dore bead is flattened with a hammer and placed in a porcelain parting cup. The cup is filled with 1:7 nitric acid and heated to dissolve the silver. When the reaction appears to be finished, a drop of concentrated nitric acid is added and the sample is observed to ensure there is no further action. The gold bead is then washed several times with hot distilled water, then is dried, annealed, cooled and weighed. Each furnace batch is comprised of 28 samples that include a reagent blank and gold standard. Crucibles are not reused until the result of the sample that was previously in each crucible has been obtained. Crucibles that have gold values of 3.00 g/t are discarded. The lower detection limit is 0.03 g/t and there is no upper limit. All values over 3.00 g/t are verified before reporting. Quality control A “Quality Assurance/Quality Control” (“QA/QC”) program was followed in 2012. One Rocklabs official standard and one blank sample were added to every 100 sample lot sent to Expert Laboratory. Security of Samples In 2012, the Francoeur samples were brought to the laboratory by employees of the laboratory. Mineral Reserve Estimates All the results of the definition drilling done in 2011 and in the beginning of 2012 were used to do the re-estimation of the Francoeur mineral reserve in June 2012. Mining costs, gold price and cut-off grade were also updated. As of June 15, 2012, proven and probable reserves of the Francoeur Mine were re-estimated to be 504,687 tonnes at a grade of 4.78 g/t Au for a total of 77,580 ounces of gold. Technical parameters used for this reserve estimation are described in the Technical Report filed on SEDAR on August 17, 2012. Following the mine closure on November 30, 2012, the Corporation retained a crew of miners to muck out all the blasted material that remained in the stopes. A new reserve estimation as of December 31, 2012, was completed for the Francoeur property. Only the blasted material remaining in the stopes and the material in surface ore stockpiles was accounted for as reserves. All the mineralisation that was defined by underground development and by all the definition drilling assay results received as of November 29, 2012 was reclassified as resources. At the end of 2013, there were no reserves at the Francoeur Mine, as the last tonne of ore was sent to the Camflo Mill in March 2013 and the mine was subsequently closed. Technical parameters A re-interpretation of the continuity of the mineralized zones on transversal sections was done with all the results received as of November 29, 2012. The following parameters were used to do the mineral resource estimation as of December 31, 2012: A minimum true width of 1.80 metres was used to build a 3D wireframe of the mineralized zone. The mineralized zone strikes along the hanging wall of the Francoeur-Wasa shear zone, with a dip of 33° above level 15 and a dip of 41° below. 70 Resource estimation was done by block model, with a block dimension of 2 x 2 x 2 metres. No capping was used for the resource estimation. One metre composites were used for the resource estimation. Grade estimation in the blocks was done by using the Inverse Distance to the power 2 (true distance) interpolation method. A circular search ellipse with a radius of a 30 metres zone was used for the selection of the composites. A minimum of 2 composites with a maximum of 16 were used for the interpolation of the blocks. A specific gravity of 2.79 g/cm3 was used for the tonnage estimate. This parameter, used by Richmont in the course of the mining operations at Francoeur, proved to be accurate. For the resource definition, a lower cut-off grade of 4.30 g/t of gold was established. This cut-off grade was used to cut the resource areas on a longitudinal section. All the blocks inside the cut areas were included in the resources. Mining methods Generally speaking, the room-and-pillar method is considered when the rock quality determination (“RQD”) is lower than 25% and for gold-bearing structures with a maximum dip of 40°. Long-hole or shrinkage-stoping methods can be envisioned when the RQD is higher than 25% and when gold-bearing structures have a minimum dip of 45°. Historically, the rate of recovery of the room-and-pillar method was 85% with an external dilution of 15% at a grade of 0.68 g/t (0.02 oz/st). These parameters were used to establish the probable reserves of the West Zone. The long-hole method was used when the orebody was dipping at more than 45°. At this critical dip, the scraping of the blasted ore was required before doing any progression in the stope. As soon as the dip of the orebody was 50° and higher, the blasted ore fell downward due to gravity to the lower level without any scraping manoeuvres. The historical rate of recovery of the long-hole method at the Francoeur Mine is 95%. Pillars of various dimensions have been left in the stopes allowing a better stability of the hanging-wall and a minimum dilution (±15%). Cut-off Grade A cut-off grade of 4.30 g/t was used for the December 31, 2012 final reserves estimation. Mineral Reserve Estimation Following its closure, the Francoeur property contained no mineral reserves. Mining Operations and Metallurgy Francoeur commercial production began on August 1, 2012 and ceased on November 30, 2012. The Francoeur Mine was in commercial production for 4 months. In 2012, 62,204 tonnes of ore from Francoeur were treated at the Camflo Mill at a grade of 4.05 g/t, producing 8,089 ounces of gold. The mucking of the underground blasted ore continued during the first quarter of 2013 and 10,149 tonnes of material was treated at the Camflo Mill in 2013 producing 1,299 ounces of gold. 71 4.2 Wasamac, Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada Location and Property Description The Wasamac property is located approximately 15 km west of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, within the heart of the Abitibi gold mining district. Description of Mining Rights The Wasamac property consists of 3 mining concessions (CM 349, CM 364, and CM 370 for 757.65 ha) and a mining claim (CDC20098 for 1.71 ha) which cover a total area of 759.36 hectares in the Beauchastel township. Ownership of Mining Rights The Corporation owns 100% of the Wasamac property. Mining Royalties There are no royalties or back-in-rights related to any of the mining concessions. Environmental Obligations and Permits The restoration work of drilling sites was completed in 2013. Approximately 20,000 trees were planted on drilling sites and on other areas of the Wasamac property. Seeding was also done on various other areas. Additional studies for authorization applications have been made. A second pump test has been conducted on the dewatering well, to perform modeling of groundwater. The procedures for approvals for the exploration ramp were put on hold pending the test results. Richmont has received the Certificate of Approval (MDDEFP) for carrying out remedial work to the south of Wasamac parks. Two spillways will be built to prevent rejection of mining residues to the environment. Work is planned during the summer of 2014. Infrastructure In the past, the Wasamac Mine had an inclined shaft dipping to the north in the footwall of the Main Zone that was approximately 420 m deep. Drifting was done on 7 main levels (every 200 feet) until approximately -400 m below surface. Two lateral drifts accessed zones 1 and 2 towards the east (at the 400 foot and 800 foot levels). The mine was closed in 1971 and is now entirely flooded. All infrastructure was dismantled and equipment removed. The surface rights covering the area of the old infrastructure and of the tailings pond are still owned by Richmont. Location of Mineralized Zones The main mineralized zones currently known on the Wasamac property are located within the Wasa shear zone. This shear zone runs through the center of the property, and has an east-west orientation and a dip of about 50° to the North. 72 Accessibility The property is located 15 km west of Rouyn-Noranda, in the province of Quebec. It is easily accessible from the Provincial Highway 117 that joins Rouyn-Noranda and the small community of Arntfield. The Wasamac property is directly accessible from Provincial Highway 117 and from a secondary road (Rang des Cavaliers). Climate The average temperatures are -17.2° C in January and +17.2° C in July based on measurements taken over 30 years in the area. There is an average of 61 cm of snowfall in December and 101.9 mm of rain in September. Local Resources and Infrastructure Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec (pop. 41,475) is a well established mining community offering a vast amount of services. The Horne copper smelter is the most important employer with a workforce of more than 500 employees. Skilled administrative personnel, technicians, geologists, mining engineers and experienced miners are available in the area. Hydro-Québec electric power is available from a provincial hydro line which runs along Provincial Highway 117. The Ontario Northland Railway runs north of the property, parallel to Provincial Highway 117. Physiography The area straddles the coniferous and boreal zones. The forest cover is composed of 50% leafy and 50% resinous trees with a moderate commercial value. The Abitibian forest is a living habitat able to support a wide diversity of mammals and birds. Amongst these, beavers and moose are the most common species. Meanwhile, the moose habitat is somewhat restricted by the absence of large coniferous covers, human activities and the close proximity of the town of Rouyn-Noranda. Beaver dams hinder the water flow in several areas (including the Wasamac property) and aquatic fur animals like muskrats, minks and otters can cohabit in such an environment. The topography is relatively flat (average 300 metres above sea level) with the exception of the northwest portion of the property where outcrops are not more than 20 metres higher than the average level, and the Monts Kekeko to the South. The local drainage heads south from creeks crosscutting the property towards the Wasa, Helene and Adeline lakes. Exploration History The Wasamac property has been the object of extensive past exploration work. The following section provides a brief exploration history. Gold mineralization was originally discovered in 1936 by Mine d’Or Champlain through surface trenching work. Subsequent surface diamond drilling intersected encouraging gold values but geological continuity seemed erratic. A 60 metre shaft (Wildcat Shaft) was sunk and one underground level was developed. In 1944, Mine d’Or Champlain changed its name to Wasa Lake Gold Mines and initiated a new exploration program. This led to the discovery of a new gold bearing zone, the Main Zone, located some 300 metres north of the Wildcat Zone. During the period from 1945 to 1948, an inclined shaft was sunk at a 55° angle down to the 1,000 foot level which was followed by significant development work on five underground levels. Ore reserves established at the time stood at just over 2 million tonnes at an average grade of 5.28 g/t Au (NI 43-101 non-compliant). 73 In 1960, Barnat Mines Ltd., in association with Little Long Lac Gold Mines, gained control of Wasa Lake Gold Mines and changed its name to Wasamac Mines Ltd. A production decision was reached in 1964, and the underground workings were dewatered and rehabilitated and commercial production officially commenced on April 1, 1965. Between 1965 and 1971, nearly 1.9 million tonnes of ore from the Wasamac deposit were treated by Wasamac Mines Ltd. followed by Wrigth-Hargreaves Mines Ltd. In May 1971, the mine ceased its operations due to low gold prices (approximately US$35/oz), increasing production costs and the abolishment of federal aid to the mining sector. Consequently, very little exploration was conducted on the property until 1974 when Lac Minerals carried out limited diamond drilling on the MacWin Zone and deep diamond drilling work on the Main Zone. During the early 1980’s, Lac Minerals reactivated exploration work on the property. In 1983, following pre-feasibility work on the surface pillar recovery, Lac Minerals drilled an additional 1,880 metres from 33 surface holes at a 15 metre spacing in order to upgrade the level of confidence of this surface zone. Following the option agreement with Lac Minerals in 1986, the exploration work conducted by Rouyn Mining Resources (“RMR”, which later changed its name to Richmont Mines Inc. in 1991), which consisted of 11 surface holes totaling 3,710 metres, was aimed at further evaluating the surface pillar zone along with Zone 1 and Main Zone down dip extensions. From November 1987 to June 1988, RMR dewatered the mine to a depth of 975 feet and rehabilitated the 400 and 800 foot levels in an attempt to explore the Zone 1 down dip extension through underground drilling. Once again, however, weak gold prices drove the Corporation to bring the project to a halt. In 1994, Richmont restored the Wasamac Mine site. All surface installations were dismantled, the shaft was capped and the tailings re-vegetated. From 1989 to 2002, exploration work on the property consisted of limited surface diamond drilling to keep the mining lease in good standing. A total of 8 surface holes were drilled during this period, totaling just over 4,500 metres. The main geological target was the Wasa shear zone at depth. In 2002, Richmont re-activated exploration work on the Wasamac property in an attempt to evaluate the down plunge extension of zones 1 and 2 at depth. In 2011, a total of approximately 52,000 metres of drilling was completed on the Wasamac property. In March 2012, the Corporation announced the results of an independent NI 43-101 compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for the Wasamac gold project. According to the PEA which assumed a gold price of CAN$1,350 (US$1,300) per ounce, the estimated total potential mine life would be 14 years with production of 6,000 tonnes per day, and an annual production of 140,000 ounces of gold. The PEA similarly estimated that the total life of mine recovered production would be 1.75 million ounces of gold at an average cash cost of US$688 per ounce, or CAN$46.15 per tonne. The undiscounted cash flows of this project were estimated to be $405 million with an internal rate of return of 7% and a payback of 8 years. Following 2012 drilling results, Richmont announced that scheduled technical work and permitting efforts would continue as planned in 2013 at Wasamac, however, no additional exploration and development activities would be undertaken on the asset. This decision was made following several months of project optimization studies, from which Richmont concluded that alternative scenarios did not currently offer a meaningful economic improvement in the current gold price environment, over the initial Preliminary Economic Assessment outlined in the Corporation’s March 28, 2012 press release. 74 Geological Setting Regional Geology The Wasamac property is located within the Rouyn-Noranda mining district, in the Abitibi greenstone belt of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. The area consists mostly of felsic to mafic volcanic rocks of Archean age along with related dioritic sills which are concordant to the regional rock formations. These volcanic and intrusive rocks have generally been metamorphosed to the green schist facies. The Superior Province is the largest exposed Archean craton in the world that hosts several world class gold deposits. It has yielded nearly 300 million ounces of gold from hundreds of deposits since the beginning of the twentieth century. One prominent characteristic of all significant gold deposits in the Superior Province is their occurrence within or immediately adjacent to greenstone belts. Another characteristic is their occurrence within major tectonic zones which comprise a series of shear zones. The Superior Province is divided into four major sub-province types: volcano-plutonic, plutonic, metasedimentary and high grade gneiss. The boundaries of these sub-provinces are either major dextral, transcurrent, east-striking faults or zones of structural and metamorphic transition. The greenstone belts which host the gold deposits occur as east-northeasterly trending ribbon domains in the volcano-plutonic terrains. They typically consist of mafic to ultramafic and felsic metavolcanics, interlayered with metasediments. The supracrustal rocks have been intruded by syn-volcanic plutons. Saturated and undersaturated felsic to mafic igneous rocks intruded into the greenstone belts in late Archean. The metamorphic grade of most of the present greenstone terrains ranges from sub-greenschist to greenschist facies in the center, to lower amphibolite facies at the margin. Amphibolite facies contact metamorphic aureoles occur around intrusions into the greenstones. Project Geology Volcanic rocks of the Blake River Group which host the gold deposits are the principal Archean rock-types exposed in the study area. Rocks of the Blake River Group are bounded to the north by the Porcupine-Destor-Parfouru fault system and to the south by the Cadillac Fault. The Blake River Group is the youngest volcanic sequence in the Superior Province and forms a central volcanic complex which is characterized by cyclic bimodal andesite-rhyolite units of calc-alkaline and tholeiitic affinity. These units are underlain by the sedimentary rocks of the Timiskaming Group, which are themselves overlain by little deformed Proterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Cobalt Group along the south boundary. The volcanic rocks are intruded by two major intrusive rocks, mafic gabbro-diorite sills and stocks that are either synvolcanic or clearly post-tectonic. All lithologies, except for the syenites, are folded and metamorphosed. Two large granitic bodies are located just north of the Wasamac property: the Flavrian and the Powell batholiths. These two bodies cross-cut the volcanic rocks and are located within the general axis of the Blake River Group syncline. Elsewhere on the property, diabase dykes of Proterozoic age and lamprophyre dykes are also found. The property can be subdivided into two distinct volcanic sequences; the southeastern portion is characterized by massive mafic to intermediate flows, while the northern portion is underlain by an intercalation of mafic volcanic flows, felsic tuffs and brecciated rhyolite. These two volcanic sequences are separated by a subsidiary fault of the Larder Lake-Cadillac tectonic zone, called the Wasa shear zone, which crosses the entire length of the property from east to west. Elsewhere on the property, several small mafic intrusive bodies composed of gabbro and diorite can be found. These intrusive bodies vary in size and seem to be generally concordant with the regional stratigraphy which runs east-west. 75 Below the Proterozoic Cobalt sediments, just south of the Wasamac property, the Larder Lake-Cadillac Fault cuts the Archean rocks and separates the rocks of the Blake River Group to the north with the sedimentary rocks of the Timiskaming Group to the south. Beside this major structure, the Archean rocks are also affected by two families of very different faults, one of which is related to the Wasa shear zone, and the other to the Horne fault. Like the regional structures, these faults and shear zones are nearly striking east-west. The Wasa shear zone is a reverse fault with a north dipping trend and is strongly hydrothermally altered on the Wasamac property. Most of the gold mineralization found on the property to date is related to the Wasa shear zone. Only minor folding has been observed on the property. Schistosity varies between south-east to north-east with a northern dip of about 55 degrees and corresponds to regional schistosity. The stratigraphic high, from pillows observation, is towards the north. Mineralization The Wasa shear zone runs through the centre of the property in an east-west fashion. This shear zone, which trends at an azimuth of 265°, has a 50-60° dip to the north and a maximum thickness of 80 metres. To the west, the shear zone splits into two separate branches and becomes thinner, while to the east, the shear zone weakens as well and displays an average thickness of 25 metres. This shear zone is characterized by the development of a strong mylonitic fabric and an intense hydrothermal alteration which totally destroyed the primary structures and textures of the protolith. Mineral assemblages of rocks within the shear zone consist of chlorite, carbonate, hematite, albite and sericite in the middle of the zone. Gold is associated with a dissemination of fine pyrite in the altered portions of the shear zone. During the production era, two gold bearing zones were mined, namely the Main Zone and the East N°1 Zone (now Zone 1), while two other less significant zones, the East N°2 (now Zone 2) and the MacWin zones, have only been delimited by diamond drilling. Main Zone: Originally discovered in 1944 through surface drilling, the Main Zone can be described as a well laminated mineralized zone. It is located near the centre of the property, within the Wasa Shear and high grade parts display true widths of 10 to 15 metres (up to 25 metres locally) over a strike length of 400 metres. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz, carbonate, sericite, albite, pyrite and chlorite inside the shear zone. Visible gold is rare and strong gold assays are generally associated with high silica content and a lot of fine grained pyrite. If the entire mineralized zone is considered, i.e. including lower grade parts, the width of the mineralized zone can reach over 50 metres. Zone 1: Located some 400 metres east of the Main Zone, this zone has a similar mineralogical assemblage with the Main Zone. The high grade part displays true widths of 4.5 to 7.5 metres over a strike length of 150 metres. During the last phase of production work, underground development work was undertaken in an effort to mine this gold bearing lens but only limited tonnage was finally extracted. The thickness of the whole mineralized envelop is larger, up to 20 metres. Zone 2: In September of 1944, surface drilling work intersected another gold bearing structure some 800 metres east of the Main Zone. The higher grade part of this zone has an average thickness of 3 to 6 metres over a strike length of 225 metres. The zone was partially developed from underground but no production was recorded. This mineralized zone is located in the upper part of the shear zone, near the hanging wall. Zone 3: This mineralization was intersected with the 2002-2004 drilling. It is located in the lower part of the shear zone, near the footwall, below the MacWin Zone. Zone 4: This new mineralized zone was discovered with the exploration drilling conducted in 2012. This small mineralized zone was intersected at the eastern edge of the property, and it extends onto the neighboring Globex Mining Enterprises claim. 76 MacWin Zone: Formerly known as the Wingate Zone, this zone was found in 1945 near the eastern property boundary and is also located within the Wasa shear zone. Wildcat Zone: Located approximately 300 metres south of the Main Zone, the Wildcat Zone was the first gold showing to be discovered on the property (1936). This gold bearing zone consists of a carbonate altered zone at the margins of a gabbroic unit. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz carbonate veinlets containing fine grained pyrite. The pyrite mineralization is also present throughout the altered halo as disseminations. Drilling Previous Exploration Work A considerable amount of exploration and development work was carried out on the Wasamac property since the discovery of the first gold-bearing veins. Successive underground developments have allowed for the discovery of additional resources along the Wasa Shear during the years the Main Zone was exploited. The most recent exploration programs conducted on the Wasamac property were completed between 2002 and 2012 by the Corporation. Several diamond drill rigs were also used on the property during the 2012 drilling program. Always with a diameter NQ, 87 exploration wells were drilled for a total of 42,809 metres. Most of these holes were drilled on private land, and agreements were reached with the respective owners. Also, to minimize disturbance to area residents, anti-noise walls were used and drilling schedules were adapted. Main results of the 2012 drilling program were: Main Zone resources at depth now account for almost all of the indicated category. The Main Zone remains open at the east and at depth. Zone 3 mineralization is now better defined, and the zone remains partly open at depth. A fourth mineralized zone was intersected at the eastern edge of the property. This area continues into part on the neighboring property. Silver grades were systematically assayed with gold. Also, samples of all the available mineralized intersections were also re-assayed for silver. The silver was included in the new resource estimate. Nearly 45% of the Wasamac resources are now in the measured and indicated resource categories. More extensive metallurgical tests were initiated on composite samples of drill core for the 4 main mineralized zones of the property. Over twenty geotechnical drill holes were also carried out to verify the quality of the rock in the crown pillar and the hanging wall of the Main Zone and Zone 1. A large diameter drilling was also carried out to intersect existing developments of the former Wasamac mine and serve as a dewatering well. All applications for permits and certificates of authorization were completed in order to begin the excavation of an exploration ramp and the dewatering of the old mine. On November 29, 2012, Richmont Mines announced that exploration work was being suspended due to current market conditions and gold price, and given that alternative mining scenarios considered showed no improvement over the results of the PEA. 77 2013 Program A cementation program of previously completed exploration holes was undertaken during the first quarter of 2013. 49 diamond drill holes were cemented followed by ground preparation for tree planting and reforestation of the property.

Gold prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, including expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, exchange rates (specifically the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies), interest rates, global and regional political and economic crises and governmental policies with respect to gold holdings by a nation’s central bank. The demand and supply of gold usually affect gold prices but not necessarily in the same manner as supply and demand affect the prices of other commodities. The whole of gold available for sale includes a combination of mine production, stock and gold bullion held by governments, public and private financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. As the amounts produced in any single year account for a small portion of the total available supply of gold, normal variations in current production do not have a significant impact on the supply of gold or on its price. The following table sets out the annual average gold price (London PM fix) in U.S. over the past five years: Exchange (US$) rate1 (CAN$) 2009 972 1.14 1,108 2010 1,225 1.03 1,262 2011 1,572 0.99 1,556 2012 1,669 1.00 1,669 2013 1,411 1.03 1,453 As at April 22, 2014 1,287 1.10 1,4161 Source: Bank of Canada Gold can be sold on numerous markets throughout the world and it is not difficult to ascertain its market price at any particular time. Richmont Mines is not dependent upon the sale of its gold to any one customer because of the large number of available gold purchasers. Richmont Mines may occasionally use put and call options on gold, and forward sales contracts on gold and U.S. dollars. All such contracts are previously approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors. Gold dore bars are transported between the mills and the refinery by commercial armoured truck. These bars are refined at the Royal Canadian Mint of Ottawa refinery under a service contract at competitive rates. Refined metal is sold on the spot market to commercial bullion dealers (or under forward sales contracts if previously approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors). In 2013, 2012 and 2011, Richmont Mines had not entered into any gold derivatives contracts. Governmental Regulation (Environment) Richmont Mines’ principal business activities are the production of gold from mining development, extraction and processing of minerals, and mining exploration to maintain and increase its ore reserves. These operations are subject to various levels of control and strict government regulations, such as laws and regulations with respect to activities related to natural resources and the protection of the environment. Environmental protection legislation applicable to the Canadian mining industry mandates high standards for the reduction or elimination of emissions, deposits, and issuance or release into the environment of contaminants caused by the extraction or processing of ore. In addition, certificates of authorization must be obtained in advance for the construction and commercial operation of a mine, plant, concentrator or refinery, since such types of operations that are specific to the mining industry may result in emissions, deposits, issuance or release of contaminants into the environment or may affect the quality of the environment. 81 Quebec & Ontario Provincial legislation in Quebec and Ontario in mining matters includes the acquisition and ownership of mining titles, safety standards, royalties and mining taxes. The Mining Act provides for the rehabilitation and restoration of lands affected by mining activities. In Ontario, approval for any plan for the rehabilitation and restoration of land affected by a Corporation’s operations is given by the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (“MNDM”), while in Quebec it is given by the Ministère des Ressources naturelles (“MRN”). Corporations must comply with the plan and provide a financial guarantee to that effect. In Quebec, when a corporation commences mining operations, it must submit its rehabilitation and closure plan before the beginning of its activities. In Ontario, the plan must be approved before the beginning of commercial production; moreover, a local public consultation must also be held. The Ministries may enjoin a corporation which has already ceased its mining operations on a particular site to perform the rehabilitation and restoration work required by the presence of tailings. In the event that the Corporation does not comply with such requirements, the MRN and the MNDM may have the rehabilitation and restoration work executed by a third party, at the Corporation’s expense. Richmont Mines does not expect to incur any specific difficulty in meeting the requirements under the Mining Act (Quebec) and the Mining Act (Ontario). Richmont Mines holds certificates of authorization issued by the Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs (the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, the “MDDEFP”) with respect to its mining operations in Quebec (Beaufor Mine, W Zone Mine, Monique Mine and Camflo Mill) and by the Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment for its Island Gold Mine, located in Ontario. C. Organization Structure See Exhibit 8.1 to this Annual Report. D. Property, Plants and Equipment See Section B. “Business Overview” above. ITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS The discussion and analysis of the operating results and financial position of the Corporation for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 should be read in conjunction with the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Annual Report. Notice should also be taken of the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 1 of this Annual Report, in particular with respect to trend and other forward looking information and disclosure regarding the Corporation’s contractual obligations. The preparation of financial statements involves making estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. The items most dependent on the use of estimates include the useful life of assets, amortization and depletion calculations based on proven and probable reserves, and the calculation of asset retirement obligations as well as future income and mining taxes. Consequently, future results may differ from these estimates. 82 On January 1st 2011, the Corporation adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board. The impacts of this transition were presented in the Corporation’s December 31, 2011 consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts presented herein are based on IFRS. Previously, the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“Canadian GAAP”). At that time, reference was made to notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation included in the Annual Report for a discussion of the material differences between Canadian GAAP and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), and their effect on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS are not comparable in all respects with financial statements that are prepared in accordance with either Canadian GAAP or with US GAAP. A. Operating Results Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012 and year ended December 31, 2011 (all dollar amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated except for share and per ounce data). Overview Gold Prices The gold market was turbulent in 2013, with the price varying by US$502 from the highest London PM fix close of US$1,694 seen on January 2, 2013, to the annual low of US$1,192 recorded on June 28, 2013. The average price of US$1,411 was US$258 or 15% below the 2012 average price of US$1,669, and was also US$161 or 10% below the 2011 average price of US$1,572. Gold began 2013 with an average of US$1,671 for January, a level that was in line with the 2012 average price per ounce of US$1,669. The monthly average gold price then declined progressively throughout the year, and finished the year with a monthly average of US$1,225 in December, the lowest monthly average of the year. The main factors that may continue to have influence on the future price of gold include: Possible strengthening in the US dollar and the US tapering of its monetary stimulus; Continued gold ETF liquidation; Weak global inflationary pressures; Increased demand levels from China, and easing of import duties in India; Uncertainty around governmental fiscal issues in North America and Europe; and Ongoing geopolitical instability. Production Richmont currently produces gold at the Island Gold Mine in Ontario and at the Beaufor/W Zone and Monique mines in Quebec. Gold sales from these operations totalled 63,443 ounces in 2013, compared to 60,741 ounces sold in 2012, with the annual difference reflecting the addition of commercial production from the Monique and W Zone mines in the fourth quarter and higher annual gold sales from the Beaufor Mine, partially offset by lower gold sales at the Island Gold Mine during the year. This compared to 76,143 ounces sold in 2011. 83 The Island Gold Mine generated gold sales of 35,113 ounces in 2013, below the 41,686 ounces of gold sold in 2012 and 49,196 ounces of gold sold in 2011, due primarily to a lower mined grade of 4.65 g/t compared to 5.45 g/t in 2012 and 6.10 g/t in 2011. As of December 31, 2013, the Island Gold Mine had Proven and Probable reserves of 143,505 ounces of gold, more than replacing its 2013 annual production. The Beaufor Mine, which has been in commercial production since 1996, generated gold sales of 23,028 ounces in 2013, in line with its targeted production range of 20,000 to 25,000, and a 21% increase from 2012 gold sales of 19,055 ounces. The annual improvement was driven by a stronger recovered grade of 5.75 g/t in 2013, versus 5.08 g/t in 2012, and higher processed tonnage year-over-year. Definition drilling completed at the Beaufor Mine during 2013 enabled this operation to replace 65% of its annual production. Proven and Probable reserves as of December 31, 2013 at the Beaufor Mine were 31,133 ounces of gold versus 39,114 ounces of gold at the end of 2012. Investments Richmont invested $41.9 million in the continued development of its assets, up from $37.9 million in 2012. The increase reflects the Corporation’s focused development efforts at Island Gold Deep, most notably the completion of an additional 848 linear meters of the underground access ramp, in addition to development costs associated with beginning commercial production at the Monique Mine at the beginning of October. Offsetting the higher investment levels at these two operations were lower development costs at the W Zone Mine, and the termination of development efforts at the Francoeur Mine operations following its closure at the end of 2012. An additional $1.0 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2013, down from $2.9 million in 2012. Richmont invested $37.9 million in the ongoing development of its assets in 2012, up from $31.7 million in 2011. The notable year-over-year increase reflects the advancement of the underground exploration drift at the Island Gold Mine to improve access for deep exploration drilling below the mine’s current infrastructure. The level of increased investment similarly reflects the development of the ramp to access the W Zone, a near-surface zone located on the Beaufor Mine property. An additional $2.9 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2012, up from $0.9 million in 2011. Summary of Operational and Financial Results Net loss in 2013 was ($34.3 million) or ($0.87) per share, compared to net loss in 2012 of ($45.0 million) or ($1.28) per share and net earnings of $25.9 million, or $0.81 per share in 2011. The cash and cash equivalent balance was $17.6 million at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $42.2 million over the $59.8 million at December 31, 2012. The cash and cash equivalent balance was $63.5 million at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2013, Richmont had working capital of $14.0 million compared with $54.3 million at December 31, 2012 and $68.7 million at December 31, 2011. 84 Changes to accounting policies New Accounting Pronouncements A number of new and revised standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2013. Information on these new standards is presented below: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income The Corporation has adopted Presentation of items of other comprehensive income (amendments to IAS 1). The Amendments to IAS 1 require entities to group items presented in other comprehensive income (OCI) into those that, in accordance with other IFRSs, will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met. The existing option to present items of OCI either before tax or net of tax remains unchanged; however, if the items are presented before tax, then the amendments to IAS 1 require the tax related to each of the two groups of OCI to be shown separately. The amendments have been applied retrospectively, and only the presentation of items of OCI has been modified to reflect the changes. The application of the amendments did not result in any other impact. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (IFRS 13) IFRS 13 clarifies the definition of fair value and provides related guidance and enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not affect which items are required to be fair-valued. The scope of IFRS 13 is broad and applies for both financial and non-financial items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements or disclosures about fair value measurements except in certain circumstances. IFRS 13 applies prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2013. Its disclosure requirements need not be applied to comparative information in the first year of application. Management reviewed its valuation methodologies and the application of the new standard did not have any effect on the fair value measurement. Consolidation standards A package of new consolidation standards is effective. Information on these new standards is presented below. These changes did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS 10) IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27) and SIC 12 Consolidation - Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 revises the definition of control and provides extensive new guidance on its application. These new requirements have the potential to affect which of the Corporation’s investees are considered to be subsidiaries and therefore change the scope of consolidation. However, the requirements on consolidation procedures, accounting for changes in non-controlling interests and accounting for loss of control of a subsidiary remain the same. Management’s analysis is that IFRS 10 did not change the classification (as subsidiaries or otherwise) of any of the existing investees. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (IFRS 11) IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures (IAS 31). It aligns more closely the accounting by the investors with their rights and obligations relating to the joint arrangement. In addition, IAS 31's option of using proportionate consolidation for joint ventures has been eliminated. IFRS 11 now requires the use of the equity accounting method, which is currently used for investments in associates. Management’s analysis is that IFRS 11 did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements as the Corporation does not have any joint arrangements. 85 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (IFRS 12) IFRS 12 integrates and makes consistent the disclosure requirements for various types of investments, including unconsolidated structured entities. It introduces new disclosure requirements about the risks to which an entity is exposed from its involvement with structured entities. Management’s analysis is that IFRS 12 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Consequential amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27) and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (IAS 28) IAS 27 now only addresses separate financial statements. IAS 28 brings investments in joint ventures into its scope. However, IAS 28's equity accounting methodology remains unchanged. Management’s analysis is that these amendments did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IFRS 7) Qualitative and quantitative disclosures have been added to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7) relating to gross and net amounts of recognized financial instruments that are (a) set off in the statement of financial position and (b) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements, even if not set off in the statement of financial position. The required disclosures should be provided retrospectively. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2013. Management’s analysis is that these amendments did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine This new interpretation addresses accounting issues regarding waste removal costs incurred in surface mining activities during the production phase of a mine, referred to as production stripping costs. The new interpretation addresses the classification and measurement of production stripping costs as either inventory or as a tangible or intangible non-current asset, depending on benefits obtained. This interpretation also provides guidance for the initial measurement, depreciation or amortization and impairment of such tangible non-current assets. The new interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2013. Management’s analysis is that this new interpretation did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Annual Improvements 2009-2011 The Annual Improvements 2009-2011 made several minor amendments to a number of IFRSs. The amendments relevant to the Corporation are summarised below: Tax effect of distribution to holders of equity instruments addresses a perceived inconsistency between IAS 12 Income Taxes (IAS 12) and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (IAS 32) with regards to recognizing the consequences of income tax relating to distributions to holders of an equity instrument and to transaction costs of an equity transaction; clarifies that the intention of IAS 32 is to follow the requirements in IAS 12 for accounting for income tax relating to distributions to holders of an equity instrument and to transaction costs of an equity transaction. Segment information for total assets and liabilities clarifies that the total assets and liabilities for a particular reportable segment are required to be disclosed if, and only if: (i) a measure of total assets or of total liabilities (or both) is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker; (ii) there has been a material change from those measures disclosed in the last annual financial statements for that reportable segment. 86 These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2013. Management’s analysis is that these improvements did not have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. Future Accounting Pronouncement At the date of authorization of these consolidated financial statements, new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Corporation. Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements not yet effective will be adopted in the Corporation’s accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Corporation’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 9 Financial instruments (IFRS 9) The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety with IFRS 9. To date, the chapters dealing with recognition, classification, measurement, derecognition of financial assets and liabilities as well as the chapter on hedge accounting have been issued. Chapter dealing with impairment methodology is still being developed. Further, in November 2011, the IASB decided to consider making limited modifications to IFRS 9’s financial asset classification model to address application issues. Furthermore, in November 2013, The IASB has decided to postpone to an unspecified date the application of IFRS 9. The Corporation’s management has yet to assess the impact of this new standard on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. Management does not expect to implement IFRS 9 until it has been completed and its overall impact can be assessed. Revenue Total annual revenues decreased 11% in 2013 to $90.2 million from $101.7 million in 2012, reflecting a 15% decrease in the average gold sales price realized in Canadian dollars, the effects of which were only partially offset by a 4% increase in the number of gold ounces sold. For the year, 63,443 ounces of gold were sold at an average price of CAN$1,419 (US$1,378) per ounce, versus gold sales of 60,741 in 2012 at an average price of CAN$1,665 (US$1,666) per ounce. The Island Gold Mine sold 35,113 ounces of gold in 2013 at an average price of CAN$1,434 (US$1,392), compared with 41,686 ounces of gold in 2012 at an average price of CAN$1,665 (US$1,666) in 2012 and 49,196 ounces of gold sold at an average price of CAN$1,549 (US$1,566) in 2011. The Beaufor Mine sold 23,028 ounces of gold at an average price of CAN$1,417(US$1,376) per ounce in 2013, compared to 19,055 ounces of gold at an average price of CAN$1,665 (US$1,666) per ounce in 2012 and 26,947 ounces of gold at an average price of CAN$1,559 (US$1,576) in 2011. The Monique and W Zone mines, which both began commercial production on October 1, 2013, sold 2,976 ounces of gold at an average price of CAN$1,328 (US$1,265) and 2,326 ounces of gold at an average price of CAN$1,328 (US$1,265), respectively, in 2013. Total annual revenues of $101.7 million in 2012 were 14% below the $118.5 million generated in 2011, reflecting a 20% decrease in the number of gold ounces sold from the Island Gold and Beaufor mines, the effects of which were partially mitigated by a 7% increase in the average gold sales price realized in Canadian dollars. 87 Expenses 2013 cost of sales increased 7% year-over-year at the Island Gold Mine to $47.5 million, reflecting a higher cost per tonne, primarily in milling, that were the result of mechanical issues at the mill during the second quarter of the year that necessitated the short-term rental of equipment from an outside supplier. Operating costs at the Beaufor Mine decreased a comparable 6% in 2013 to $26.8 million from $28.6 million in 2012, as a 12% decrease in cost per tonne offset the 7% increase in tonnage. The Corporation’s Monique and W Zone mines, which both began commercial production on October 1, 2013, contributed $4.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively, to the 2013 consolidated cost of sales of $85.8 million, with costs levels at the W Zone Mine reflecting materially higher depreciation expense following the reduction of its reserve base. The average cash cost of production increased 8% in Canadian dollars in 2013 to CAN$1,128 (US$1,095) from CAN$1,044 (US$1,044) in 2012, as higher costs at the Island Gold Mine stemming from lower grades and the high costs at the Monique and W Zone mines in their initial ramp up stage, were only partially offset by lower year-over-year costs at the Beaufor Mine stemming from the improved grade and lower cost per tonne. Cost of sales in 2012 of $73.8 million were 3% above the 2011 levels of $71.7 million, with the increase primarily driven by a 16% rise in the level of tonnage processed from the Beaufor Mine during the year. On a segmented basis, 2012 cost of sales decreased 2% year-over-year at the Island Gold Mine to $44.4 million, reflecting lower tonnage, and lower royalties and depreciation and depletion expense as a result of the 15% decrease in gold ounces sold. Operating costs at the Beaufor Mine increased 8% in 2012 to $28.7 million from $26.5 million in 2011, primarily a reflection of higher tonnage. The average cash cost of production increased 29% in Canadian dollars in 2012 to CAN$1,044 (US$1,044) from CAN$812 (US$821) in 2011. The increase reflects higher costs at both the Island Gold Mine and Beaufor Mine operations, which were driven by slightly lower recovered grades and tonnage at Island Gold, and a significant reduction of grades at Beaufor. The amount of royalties paid out in 2013 decreased to $1.9 million from $2.3 million in 2012, reflecting lower royalty levels at the Island Gold Mine as a result of the 16% decrease in gold ounces sold and a 14% lower gold price. This was only partially mitigated by slightly higher royalties at the Beaufor Mine as a result of increased gold sales, and royalties at both the Monique and W Zone mines following their transition into commercial production. 2012 royalties of $2.3 million were below the 2011 level of $2.6 million in 2011, with the decrease reflecting lower consolidated production levels, partially offset by the higher average gold price. The Corporation pays a 3% net smelter return royalty (NSR) royalty on the greater part of the gold production at the Island Gold Mine, royalties of $30 per ounce on 50% of the ounces produced from the Beaufor Mine and the W Zone Mine, and a 0.38% net smelter return royalty (NSR) on commercial gold production from the Monique Mine (please see Note 22 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details). Custom milling - Richmont processed 7,314 tonnes of custom milling ore in 2012. Richmont did not process any custom milling ore at the Camflo Mill in 2013 and in 2011. Administration - Administration expenses totaled $7.5 million in 2013 versus $10.3 million in 2012. The lower overall cost reflects lower non-cash expenses for share-based compensation, as the value of 1,639,000 options granted during the year was impacted by the lower share price, as well as lower severance compensation following the payment of $2.0 million in severance compensation to the Corporation’s ex-President and CEO in 2012. Administration expenses totaled $10.3 million in 2012 versus $5.5 million in 2011. The higher overall cost was related to higher non-cash expenses for share-based compensation as 1,736,575 options were granted to directors, employees and officers, the payment of a $2.0 million severance compensation to the Corporation’s ex-President and CEO in the first half of 2012, to higher Board compensation, and higher salary costs stemming from the greater number of administrative employees. Exploration and project evaluation – As in previous years, Richmont Mines continued its investments related to exploration and project evaluation. 88 Exploration Costs (in thousands of $) 2013 2012 2011 $ $ $ Exploration costs - Mines Island Gold1 4,532 10,969 5,549 Beaufor 1,929 1,432 803 Monique 221 744 2,284 W Zone - - 188 6,682 13,145 8,824 Exploration costs - Other properties Wasamac 1,102 9,477 6,647 Other 347 459 184 Project evaluation 474 511 470 Exploration and project evaluation before depreciation and exploration tax credits 8,605 23,592 16,125 Depreciation 229 200 155 Exploration tax credits (959 ) (3,527 ) (5,354 ) 7,875 20,265 10,926 1 Includes Island Gold Deep. Accretion expense of asset retirement obligations – The Corporation’s production and exploration activities are subject to various federal and provincial laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Corporation conducts its operations so as to protect public health and the environment. The Corporation has recorded the asset retirement obligations of its mining sites on the basis of management’s best estimates of future costs, based on information available on the reporting date. Best estimates of future costs are the amount the Corporation would reasonably pay to settle its obligation on the closing date. Future costs are discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Such estimates are subject to change based on modifications to laws and regulations or as new information becomes available. This charge was $81 thousand in 2013, compared with $66 thousand in 2012 and $127 thousand in 2011. 89 Loss (Gain) on disposal of long term assets – The loss (gain) on disposal of long term assets includes the following items: (in thousands of $) 2013 2012 2011 $ $ $ Valentine Lake property a) - - (3,000 ) Mining equipment 105 198 (10 ) 105 198 (3,010 ) a) On January 24, 2011, the Corporation received $3,000 from Mountain Lake Resources Inc. for the sale of its 70% interest in the Valentine Lake property located in Central Newfoundland. A gain on the disposal of long-term assets was recognized for the same amount. Mining and Income Taxes (in thousands of $) 2013 2012 2011 $ $ $ Current taxes 785 4,610 5,020 Future taxes 7,209 (4,237 ) 3,523 7,994 373 8,543 For the fiscal year 2013, mining and income taxes totalled $8.0 million, including a write-off of $7.5 million of deferred income and mining tax assets. In the charge there is an amount of $0.5 million for current tax expense and a same amount booked against exploration expense. The 2012 current tax expense totalled $4.6 million and includes Ontario mining taxes of $1.5 million, an adjustment to previous year taxes of $1.4 million and a recorded tax charge of $1.8 million, the latter of which enabled the Corporation to benefit from an exploration credit of the same amount. The recovery of future taxes is due to a $2.3 million reduction in liabilities for future mining taxes and a reduction of $1.9 million for income taxes. For the fiscal year 2011, mining and income taxes totalled $8.5 million or 25% of pre-tax earnings of $34.5 million. During the year, the Corporation recognized future income tax assets of $1.1 million, which reduced the income tax expense by the same amount. Excluding this income tax asset of $1.1 million, the tax rate would be 28%, the effective tax rate for the Corporation. Net loss from discontinued operation At the end of November 2012, management made the decision to cease commercial gold production at the Francoeur Mine. This Mine is included in the Quebec segment. As a result, revenues, expenses and losses relating to the discontinuation of this operation have been segregated from the Corporation’s results from continuing operations, and are shown as a single line item in the consolidated income statement. The Francoeur Mine remaining property, plant and equipment have been valued at their recoverable amount, and management expects that the majority of these assets will be redeployed to the Corporation’s other mines. The recoverable value of assets was established by three internal experts with the necessary expertise to determine the value of mining assets. They evaluated the fair value for each asset considering the general condition of the asset as well as the actual conditions of the market. Total charges related to the mine closure including asset write-down, 90 closure costs and operational losses, totaled $1.1 million in 2013 and $42.0 million for the full year of 2012, after mining and income taxes. Net Earnings (loss) The Corporation generated a net loss from continuing operations of ($33.2) million, or ($0.84) per share, for the 2013 fiscal year. This compared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($3.0) million, or ($0.08) per share, in 2012, which excluded a loss associated with the discontinued Francoeur Mine operation. The variance year-over-year reflects charges totaling $22.8 million, or $0.58 per share, specifically a non-cash write-down of the W Zone Mine assets, a write-off of deferred income and mining tax assets, a write-off of financing costs following the termination of a debt-financing agreement and severance charges. The annual variance in results also reflects a 15% decrease in the average realized gold price in Canadian dollars, an 8% increase in the average cash cost per ounce stemming partly from the onset of commercial production at the Monique and W Zone mines in the fourth quarter, as well as higher cost at Island Gold, the effects of which were only partially mitigated by a 4% increase in the number of gold ounces sold. Richmont’s net loss from continuing operations of ($3.0) million, or ($0.08) per share, in 2012 compared to net earnings of $25.9 million, or $0.81 per share, in 2011, with the annual variance primarily attributable to the 20% decrease in the number of ounces of gold sold that was driven by slightly lower tonnage and recovered grades at Island Gold and a significant grade reduction at Beaufor as well as a significant increase in exploration project and evaluation expenses. Partially mitigating the effect of this was a 7% increase in the selling price per ounce of gold in Canadian dollars. Balance Sheet Assets The total assets of Richmont Mines decreased from $168.0 million at the end of 2011 to $148.2 million at the end of 2012 and decreased to $123.3 million at the end of 2013. At December 31, 2013, Richmont had working capital of $14.0 million compared with $54.3 million at December 31, 2012. The decrease of $40.3 million in working capital reflects the negative variation in cash and cash equivalent of $42.2 million, mostly from the $41.9 million invested in proprety, plant and equipement, a $2.2 million increase in exploration tax credits receivable related to exploration credits in 2013 from the Province of Quebec and the fact that no credit was received from previous year, and a $1.3 million increase in inventories and a $2.5 million increase in accounts payables both related to two new mines, and a $0.7 million decrease in income and mining taxes payable. At December 31, 2012, Richmont had working capital of $54.3 million compared with $68.7 million at December 31, 2011. The $14.4 million decrease reflects a $3.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, a $9.7 million decrease in exploration tax credits receivable, a portion of which were applied against income and mining tax liabilities, and a $5.4 million increase in account payables and accrued charges that stemmed from the discontinuation of operations at the Francoeur Mine. Liabilities The amount of liabilities of Richmont was $37.0 million as at December 31, 2013 and is composed of current liabilities, asset retirement obligations, finance lease obligations, contract payment holdback, long-term share based compensation, closure allowance and deferred income and mining tax liabilities.The amount of liabilities of the Corporation was $29.9 million as at December 31, 2012, compared with $33.9 million at December 31, 2011. 91 Asset retirement obligations The rate used to determine the future value of the obligations is based on the expected life of the operation and varies between 3.0% and 3.5% (3.5% in 2012) while the rate reflecting the current market assessments (adjusted for the risks specific to this liability) used to determine the present value of the obligations varies between 1.1% and 1.7% (1.3% in 2012). The payments schedule was determined by taking into account the proven and probable reserves and the estimated annual production level. The following table sets forth the estimated cash flows of future retirement costs used in the calculation of the asset retirement obligations for the year ended December 31, 2013: (in thousands of $) Total amountof the estimatedcash flow Anticipatedcash flowpaymentschedule 2013 $ Monique Mine 976 2015 Beaufor Mine and W Zone Mine 766 2016 Island Gold Mine 1,748 2017 Camflo Mill 3,996 2018 Francoeur Mine 820 2014 and after 8,306 Long-Term Debt Long-term debt includes the following financial liabilities: (in thousands of $) December 31, December 31, 2013 2012 $ $ Finance lease obligations a) 3,737 995 Contract payment holdback b) 1,000 - Long-term share-based compensation c) 711 639 Closure allowance d) 573 - 6,021 1,634 Current portion 825 932 5,196 702 a) During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Corporation acquired rolling stock at a cost of $4.4 million via five finance leases ($1.6 million via two finance lease obligations in 2012). The Corporation benefits from an option of a lower purchase price at the end of these contracts. Four finance lease obligations is for four underground hault trucks and have a total carrying value of $3.3 million. The fifth finance lease obligation is for a scoop and has a carrying value of $938 thousand. 92 The net carrying value of the rolling stock under these finance leases amounts to $4,792 ($846 in 2012). Future minimum finance lease payments at December 31, 2013 are as follows: (in thousands of $) Minimum lease payments due 2014 2015 2016 2017 Total December 31, 2013: Lease payments 986 922 922 1,310 4,140 Finance charges (161 ) (123 ) (84 ) (35 ) (403 ) Net present values 825 799 838 1,275 3,737 b) The contract payment holdback represents amounts that are payable to a supplier for work that has already been completed. The holdback is payable upon completion of the contract, once the Corporation has deemed that the work meets requirements or when the contract is terminated. As at December 31, 2013, the Corporation has not yet deemed that the work done by the supplier meets requirements and estimates that the payment of the holdback will not occur in the next year . c) In March and in August 2012, the Corporation signed agreements with several employees considered as key personnel. These agreements incorporate a retention payment (“Retention Awards”) provided certain conditions are met by the employee, most notably that the employee continues his or her employment with the Corporation until March and August 2017. These retention payments would be payable in 2017 in either of the Corporation’s common shares or cash, at the discretion of the employee, with the number of common shares to be determined by the current value of the common shares at the time of payment. As at December 31, 2013, the total amount that could be paid as Retention Awards under these agreements is 2.25 million dollars (6 million dollars in 2012). The cost recorded in 2013 is $742 ($639 in 2012) and the liability to this effect amounts to $711 as at December 31, 2013 ($639 in 2012), which correspond to the best estimate of the amount to be paid relating to the Retention Awards, based on estimated forfeitures and a 1.3% discount rate. d) This closure allowance is payable upon the closure of the Beaufor Mine anticipated to be in 2016. Although no specific date or timeframe has been established for the closure of the mine, this closure allowance has been established using the best estimation of the amount that would be payable when the division will close. Deferred income and mining tax assets and liabilities Note 11 of the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report provides detailed information about tax reconciliation as well as deferred income and mining tax assets and liabilities. Shareholders’ equity Shareholders’ equity totaled $86.4 million as at December 31, 2013 compared with $118.4 million as at December 31, 2012 and with $134.1 million as at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2013, Richmont Mines had 39,596,103 shares outstanding, 812,500 warrants, 3,439,950 options granted under its stock option plans and 324,675 options outside of the Corporation’s plans. At December 31, 2012, Richmont Mines had 39,566,103 shares outstanding and 2,277,450 options granted under its stock option plans and 324,675 options outside of the Corporation’s plans compared with 33,109,963 shares outstanding and 1,636,600 options granted under its stock option plan at December 31, 2011. 93 Commitments and contingencies In October 2013, Richmont announced that a portion of the Island Gold Deep resource base was within four patented claims for which Richmont owns 69% with the remaining 31% being held by a third party. The Corporation has held discussions with the third party with the objective of acquiring the 31% interest in the four claims that it does not currently own but has not yet been able to reach an agreement. In the interim, work continues according to previously established plans and budgets, with each party to be held responsible for its proportion of the expenditures (those already booked and future expenditures). The Corporation is subject to pay the following royalties: the Beaufor Mine and the W Zone Mine, $30 per ounce produced on 50% of the production; Island Gold Mine, a 3% net smelter return royalty per ounce produced from the Lochalsh claims and a 2% net smelter return royalty in addition to a 15% net profit interest royalty per ounce produced from the Goudreau claims; and at the Monique Mine, a 0.38% smelter return royalty per ounce produced. Royalty payments could be payable on other properties if such other properties are brought into commercial production. The Corporation is committed, under an operating lease expiring in December 2017, to pay a total sum of $0.5 million for office space. Minimum rental payments for the next four years amount to $0.1 million annually. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Corporation entered into five financial lease agreements for rolling stock (two finance leases in 2012). At the end of these contracts, the Corporation benefits from an option of a lower purchase price. These financial lease agreements have a carrying value of $3.7 million. The net carrying value of the rolling stock under financial leases amounts to $4.8 million. In mid-October 2013, the Corporation announced that it had signed a land and mining rights agreement with Argonaut Gold Inc., owner of the Magino Gold Project that is adjacent to the Corporation’s Island Gold Mine. With this Agreement, the Corporation will secure mining rights below a depth of 400 metres on several claims to the south of the Island Gold Deep Project, and will acquire a claim which will extend the western boundary of its Island Gold Deep Project by a distance of 585 metres towards the west. In exchange, Argonaut will receive exploration and mining rights from surface to a maximum depth of 400 metres on certain Richmont claims that border the Magino Gold Project. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Corporation will receive a net payment of $2.0 million in cash from Argonaut upon completion of the land transactions, which is expected to take place by the end of the first quarter of 2014. On December 20, 2013 the Corporation announced that it had decided to terminate, with no cancellation costs, the Senior Secured Credit Facility (the “Facility”) for up to US$50.0 million secured in mid-June and subsequently closed in August 2013, with Macquarie Bank Limited (“Macquarie”). At the onset of discussions with Macquarie in March 2013, financing the development of Island Gold Deep partly through debt was deemed a good business decision, and the hedging of a minimal amount of production ounces to lock in attractive margins was deemed to be a prudent approach given the higher gold price. Following the approximate $400/ounce decrease in the gold price, however, management believed that it was in the best interest of the Corporation and its shareholders to terminate the Facility, with the objective of developing Island Gold Deep through internally-generated cash flow from the Corporation’s producing mines. In March and in August 2012, the Corporation signed agreements with several employees considered as key personnel. These agreements incorporate a retention payment (“Retention Awards”) provided certain conditions are met by the employee, most notably that the employee continues his or her employment with the Corporation until March and August 2017. These retention payments would be payable in 2017 in either of the Corporation’s common shares or cash, at the discretion of the employee, with the number of common shares to be determined by the current value of the common shares at the time of payment. As at December 31, 2013, the total amount that could be paid as Retention Awards under these agreements is $2.3 million. 94 A wholly owned subsidiary, acquired in December 2008, is currently subject to a tax review concerning a December 2006 financing done through the issuance of flow-through shares. The purpose of the review is to determine if the expenditures made are acceptable Canadian Exploration Expenses under the laws of flow-through share financing. No provision has been accounted for in the financial statements as Management is of the opinion that this financing was compliant with the applicable laws. In 2012, the Corporation received a draft assessment from the Quebec tax authorities, whom are not allowing the Corporation to claim certain exploration tax credits for years 2009 to 2011. An amount of $4.1 million initially recorded as exploration tax credits receivable was reversed and reflected as an increase to property, plant and equipment. The management of the Corporation is contesting this position, because it believes that the Corporation had the right to claim these exploration tax credits. The Corporation decided, in February 2014, to mine the economical part of the ore body already developed at the W Zone Mine and then to suspend operations, which is currently estimated to take place by the end of the second quarter of 2014. On April 3,2014, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. (“Macquarie”) as lead underwriter, on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters, for the issuance of 7.0 million common shares of the Corporation, on a bought-deal basis, at a price of $1.45 per share (the “Offering Price”) for gross proceeds of $10.15 million. The syndicate of underwriters also includes BMO Capital Markets, CIBC World Markets and Desjardins Securities. In addition, the underwriters have been granted an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1.05 million common shares from the Corporation (the “Over-Allotment Option”), exercisable in whole or in part at the Offering Price for a period of 30 days from closing of the Offering, for additional gross proceeds of up to approximately $1.52 million. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the total gross proceeds to Richmont will be $11.67 million. Richmont plans to use the net proceeds of the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.The Offering is expected to close on or about April 23, 2014, and is subject to certain conditions, including but not limited to the receipt of all necessary approvals including those of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange Market. The Corporation is involved in three (3) legal proceedings as of April 22, 2014: Against Sterling Oil & Gas Corporation (“Sterling”), who was the propane supplier for the Island Gold Mine. Richmont Mines is suing Sterling for an approximate amount of $156 thousand. The Corporation presented its claim in front of the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, for a breach of contract which occurred on July 30, 2010. In response to this claim, Sterling is countersuing Richmont Mines for an approximate amount of $365 million, mainly related to the installation and rental of Sterling equipment. Management is of the opinion that the basis of Sterling’s countersuit is unfounded. The trial is expected to be held in 2014. Against 6676162 Canada Inc., which filed legal procedures in the Court of Quebec in June 2010 for a claim of $450 thousand. A decision was rendered on November 29, 2010. The request was rejected due to the fact that 6676162 Canada Inc. was not represented by counsel at the outset which is counter to the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. A new application to institute proceedings was filed on February 23, 2011. Richmont transferred the case to arbitrators as stipulated in the contract. The parties have chosen arbitration before three arbitrators. Both Richmont and 6676162 Canada Inc. have each chosen one arbitrator. The third arbitrator will be selected by the first two. Richmont made a counterclaim of $218 thousand for repairs that needed to be redone. The arbitration is expected to be held in June 2014. 95 Richmont filed a legal procedure against Agrégat RN, its former contractor at the Monique Mine, for an amount of $1.4 million, representing corrective measures that had to be performed by Richmont’s new contractor. Richmont is now waiting for the defense and counterclaim documents from Agrégat RN. Richmont received a formal notice that a construction lien had been placed on its Monique Mine by Agrégat RN for an amount of $4.2 million. On March 19, 2014, Richmont received a 60-day notice of exercise of construction lien from Agrégat RN. The trial is expected to be held only in 2015. As at April 22, 2014, Richmont Mines is not aware of any other legal proceedings involving the Corporation. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and the formulation of assumptions that have a significant impact on revenue and expenses as well as on the amounts of assets and liabilities. The following factors represent the estimates that management considers the most significant, and for which the actual amounts may differ considerably thereby affecting operating results. Mineral reserves The main parameters used to determine the mineral reserves of Beaufor Mine, W Zone Mine, Monique Mine and Island Gold Mine are the following: 2013 2012 2011 Gold (US$/ounce) 1,225 1,450 1,200 Exchange rate (US$/CAN$) 1.06 1.00 1.00 Gold (CAN$/ounce) 1,300 1,450 1,200 Basis of depletion of mining sites in production Property, plant and equipment of mining sites in production are depleted according to the units-of-production method to write down the cost to residual value. Management estimates the residual value of property, plant and equipment based on the estimated fair value as of the financial position date. For these assets, the depletion rate is calculated based on the number of ounces of gold sold in proportion to the number of ounces in proven and probable reserves. Proven and probable reserves are estimates of the quantity of ore that could be economically and legally extracted from a mine. The Corporation estimates its reserves using information compiled by qualified persons who work for the Corporation. This information relates to geological data on the size, depth and shape of the deposit and requires geological assessments to interpret the data. The assessment of proven and probable reserves is based on factors such as the estimated exchange rate, price of metals, capital investments required and production costs stemming from geological assumptions based on the size and grade of the deposit. Changes in proven and probable reserves could have an impact on the net carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, asset retirement obligations, recognition of deferred tax assets and amortization, depreciation and depletion expenses. 96 Asset retirement obligations The Corporation assesses its asset retirement obligations annually. Determining these obligations requires significant estimates and assumptions due to the numerous factors that affect the amount ultimately payable. Such factors include estimates of the scope and cost of restoration activities, legislative amendments, known environmental impacts, the effectiveness of reparation and restoration measures and changes in the discount rate. This uncertainty may lead to differences between the actual expense and the allowance. At the date of the statement of financial situation, asset retirement obligations represent management’s best estimate of the charge that will result when the actual obligation is terminated. Impairment test of property, plant and equipment Determining if there are any facts and circumstances indicating impairment losses or reversal of impairment losses is a subjective process involving judgment and a number of estimates and interpretations in many cases. When an indication of an impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss exists, the recoverable amount of the individual asset must be estimated. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs must be determined. The assumption used in the asset valuation process was a price of CAN$1,300 per ounce of gold in 2014, in 2015, and in 2016. These prices are used in order to estimate future revenues and are based on an average of recent prices. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating results, such as future metal production (proven and probable reserves), estimated future metal prices, operating costs, capital and site restoration expenses and estimated future foreign exchange rates. These assumptions relate to future events and circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimated results. Income taxes and deferred mining taxes The Corporation is subject to taxes from different tax jurisdictions. Management continually evaluates the likelihood that its deferred tax assets could be realized. This requires management to assess whether it is probable that sufficient taxable income will exist in the future to utilize these losses within the carry-forward period. The Corporation also maintains allowances for uncertain tax positions that, in its opinion, appropriately reflect the risks related to the tax positions subject to discussions, audits, differences of opinion and appeals with the tax authorities or that are otherwise uncertain. These allowances are determined using best estimates of the amount payable based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant information. These allowances are reassessed at the end of each financial reporting period to determine if the amount is sufficient. However, audits by the tax authorities could subsequently result in an additional liability. Upon the definite resolution of a tax issue resulting in a tax amount that differs from the initially recognized tax expense, the difference is recognized in the tax expense of the period of definitive settlement. Share-based remuneration expense The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen. The Corporation has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable life of options and the time of exercise of those options. The model used by the Corporation is the Black-Scholes model. The Corporation similarly evaluated the expected extinguishments for each remuneration program within the parameters of each individual program. Dismantling costs and severance costs The Corporation estimates dismantling costs and severance costs by making assumptions such as retention of employees and timing of dismantling. The uncertainty of these estimations may lead to differences between the actual expenses and the estimated costs. 97 Provisions and contingent liabilities Judgments are made as to whether a past event has led to a liability that should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements or disclosed as a contingent liability. Quantifying any such liability often involves judgments and estimations. These judgments are based on a number of factors including the nature of the claims or dispute, the legal process and potential amount payable, legal advice received, past experience and the probability of a loss being realized. Several of these factors are sources of estimation uncertainty. Start of advanced exploration phase The Corporation evaluates the potential of each project to determine when the project should progress from the exploration phase to the advanced exploration phase. Once management has determined that a project has demonstrated a potential for development, and an economic analysis supports its commercial viability and its economic benefit, the project moves into the advanced exploration phase once approval has been given by the Board of Directors. Expenditures related to the project are capitalized as of this time. Start of commercial production Management assesses the stage of completion of each advanced exploration project to determine when it begins commercial production. The Corporation considers a number of criteria to determine when a mine enters into commercial production, thereby resulting in reclassification from “Advanced exploration project” to “Mining site in production”. The following criteria are used: Production capacity achieved Recovered grade Stage of completion of development work When a mine considered to be an advanced exploration project becomes a mining site under production, previously capitalized costs are allocated among the various assets, such as inventory, development expenses, buildings and equipment. Additionally, from that time, some previously capitalized costs are then recognized as expenses and the related income is recognized as precious metals revenue. Depreciation/depletion begins at that time as well.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (all dollar amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated) At December 31, 2013, Richmont had a working capital of $14.0 million compared with $54.3 million at December 31, 2012 and $68.7 million at December 31, 2011. The decrease reflects a $42.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, a $2.2 million increase in exploration tax credits receivable and a $1.3 million increase in inventories, and a $2.5 million increase in accounts payables, and a $0.7 million decrease in income and mining taxes payable. From 2012 to 2011, the $14.4 million decrease reflects a $3.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, a $9.7 million decrease in exploration tax credits receivable, a portion of which were applied against income and mining tax liabilities, and a $5.4 million increase in account payables and accrued charges that stemmed from the discontinuation of operations at the Francoeur Mine. Most of the restricted deposits relate specifically to site restoration. As at December 31, 2013, the Corporation has $117 thousand in restricted deposits with the Quebec government, $594 thousand in restricted deposits with the Ontario government and $2.7 milllion in guaranteed investment certificate to secure a credit facility available to the Corporation up to an amount of $4.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit as guarantees for the settlement of asset retirement obligations. The credit facility has a fixed annual fee of 0.95% (0.85% in 2012). The following table provides the allocation of restricted deposits and letters of credit issued as at December 31, 2013: (in thousands of $) 2013 2012 $ $ Restricted deposits Island Gold Mine (Island Gold Deep and Lochalsh property) 594 184 Beaufor Mine 107 107 Other 10 54 711 345 Guaranteed investment certificate, 1.25% maturing in February 20141 2,650 - Other 60 339 3,421 684 Letters of credit1 Camflo Mill 1,332 1,332 Island Gold Mine (Kremzar property) 979 979 Francoeur Mine 239 - Additional credit 100 - 2,650 2,311 1 Letters of credit are secured by the guaranteed investment certificate. Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operations decreased from $7.7 million in 2012 to $3.5 million in 2013. The annual variance reflects a 15% decrease in the average realized gold price in Canadian dollars, an 8% increase in the average cash cost per ounce stemming partly from the onset of commercial production at the Monique and W Zone mines in the fourth quarter, as well as higher cost at Island Gold, the effects of which were only partially mitigated by a 4% increase in the number of gold ounces sold. 99 Cash flows from operations decreased from $38.8 million in 2011 to $7.7 million in 2012. This decrease reflects that net earnings in 2011 were $25.9 million, or $0.81 per share, compared with net loss of $45.0 million or ($1.28) per share in 2012 reflecting a 20% decrease in ounces of gold sales mitigated by a 7% increase in the selling price in Canadian dollars. Futhermore Richmont spent $20.3 million in exploration costs in 2012 compared to $10.9 million in 2011. Cash flows used in investing activities In 2013, Richmont invested $41.9 million in the continued development of its assets, up from $37.9 million in 2012. The increase reflects the Corporation’s focused development efforts at Island Gold Deep, most notably the completion of an additional 848 linear meters of the underground access ramp, in addition to development costs associated with beginning commercial production at the Monique Mine at the beginning of October. Offsetting the higher investment levels at these two operations were lower development costs at the W Zone Mine, and the termination of development efforts at the Francoeur Mine operations following its closure at the end of 2012. An additional $1.0 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2013, down from $2.9 million in 2012. The Corporation invested $37.9 million in property, plant and equipment in 2012, up from $31.7 million in 2011. The increase reflects the advancement of the underground exploration drift at the Island Gold Mine to improve access for deep exploration drilling below the mine’s infrastructure. The level of increased investment similarly reflected the development of the ramp to access the W Zone. An additional $2.9 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2012, up from $0.9 million in 2011.

In 2011, the Corporation issued 899,400 common shares following the exercise of stock options, for a total cash consideration of $2.8 million. According to the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, 812,500 warrants were issued to the lender, each warrant allowing for the acquisition of one common share at a price of $2.45 prior to August 2016. These warrants vested immediately and an amount of $0.4 million was registered in shareholder’s equity in contributed surplus and the counterpart as financing costs. In September 2012, the Corporation issued, as part of a private placement, 5,972,540 common shares at $4.35 each for a total consideration of $26.0 million. An expense of $1.0 million has been incurred relating to the issuance of common shares, creating a non recorded future tax asset of $0.2 million. 100 On October 2011, the Corporation issued, as part of a private placement, 980,500 common shares at $10.50 each, for a total cash consideration of $10.3 million and 245,125 stock warrants. An amount of $0.5 million was incurred in relation to the issuance of common shares, creating a future tax asset of $0.1 million. Capital disclosures Richmont’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $17.6 million at December 31, 2013, $59.8 million at December 31, 2012 and $63.5 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation invests its cash and cash equivalents in high-quality securities issued by government agencies, financial institutions and major corporations, and limits its amount of credit exposure by diversifying its holdings. The Corporation’s objectives when managing its capital are to safeguard the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to support ongoing exploration programs and the development of its mining assets, to provide sufficient working capital to meet its ongoing obligations and to pursue potential investments. Although in the Corporation’s opinion, its working capital is sufficient for the next twelve months, on April 3, 2014, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. (“Macquarie”) as lead underwriter, on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters, for the issuance of 7.0 million common shares of the Corporation, on a bought-deal basis, at a price of CAN$1.45 per share (the “Offering Price”) for gross proceeds of $10.15 million. (See ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION - B. Significant change for more information). The proceeds will be used for working capital and for general corporate purposes. The Corporation’s profitability may vary significantly as a result of many factors, including, the price of gold, Canadian dollar/United States dollar exchange rate, fluctuations in commodity prices and unforeseen variations from expected grade, tonnage levels and production costs at its operating mines, most of which are not under the Corporation’s control. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the Corporation’s working capital will continue to be sufficient to support its ongoing operations. The Corporation has no material commitments for either capital expenditures or its exploration program. The Corporation’s budget can be modified and its investments adjusted depending on available funds and operating and exploration results. The exploration and development of new mineral deposits is subject to numerous risks, discussed in greater detail on page 8. As at December 31, 2013, Richmont Mines had no hedging contracts. In order to finance additional exploration activities or to maintain or increase its liquidity and capital resources, the Corporation may decide to issue new shares or to issue new debt. C.

Director Compensation (other than the Executive Chairman of the Board) for the financial year ended on December 31, 2013 During a meeting held in December 2012, the members of the Board of Directors determined the annual compensation granted to the members of the Board for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. During this meeting, it was decided that the members of the Board (with the exception of the Executive Chairman of the Board) would be paid a sum of $35,000 in annual compensation for the 2013 year, that an additional sum of $12,000 per year would be paid to each Chair of a sub-committee of the Board of Directors, and that members of committees would be paid $4,000 per year per committee they are on. The level of the annual compensation of the members of the Board of Directors (with the exception of the Executive Chairman of the Board) is based on the Human Resources and Compensation Committee’s analysis regarding compensation levels of directors of mining companies that are similar to Richmont. Executive Chairman of the Board compensation for the financial year ended on December 31, 2013 On December 10, 2013, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors ratified, that the Executive Chairman’s compensation of $270,000 should remain for the 2014 fiscal year. On an aggregate basis, the Corporation’s Board members therefore received total compensation of $1,041,960 during the 2013 fiscal year, as detailed in the table below.

Directors Name Elected or Appointed Director H. Greg Chamandy May 2009 Elaine Ellingham February 2010 Michael Pesner November 2010 Paul Carmel May 2012 René Marion November 2013 James Gill December 2013 Employment Contracts The Corporation has entered into employment contracts with the Named Executive Officers: Paul Carmel, as President and Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Rougeau, as Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, Nicole Veilleux, as Financial Director and Daniel Adam, as Vice-President, Exploration. Christian Pichette, Executive Vice-President and Chief Operation Officer retired on December 15, 2013 after his contract ended. The total compensation that was paid to Mr. Christian Pichette after his retirement was $476,139. The contract of Nicole Veilleux provides that, in the event of termination initiated by the Corporation without cause or initiated by a Named Executive Officer for good reason, or if the contract is not renewed, the Financial Director, Mrs. Veilleux will be entitled to one month of total compensation by year of service, whether such year of service is completed or not. For the purposes of calculating the severance payment, the Named Executive Officer’s total compensation will be based on the annual average of the two (2) complete fiscal years immediately preceding the date of termination. Moreover, and notwithstanding the provisions contained in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan and the conditions of the options held by the Named Executive Officer, all the options held by the Named Executive Officer will become vested on the termination date. Also, the options thus vested on the termination date will be exercisable on the earliest of the following two dates: (i) on the dates initially stipulated; or (ii) two years after the termination date. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that the termination occurred on the last working day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation and that this date falls during the renewal term of the contract of employment of the Named Executive Officer is $333,955 for the Financial Director. That amount includes the options annual average value attributed during the last two years. The contracts of Paul Carmel and Pierre Rougeau provide that, if the termination occurs at any time, by the Corporation, without cause, Mr. Carmel and Mr. Rougeau will be entitled to the basic payments (accrued base salary, accrued expenses and vacation), to an indemnity in lieu of notice representing two (2) times the base salary at the time of the termination of the agreement (one (1) time in the case of Mr. Rougeau), the entitlement under the annual bonus plan, the whole minus applicable deductions and the same level of group insurance benefits he was receiving or entitled to receive for two (2) years (one (1) year in the case of Mr. Rougeau) following the date of termination. All un-vested options held by the executive on the date of termination will automatically vest on this day. 109 The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that the termination occurred on the last working day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation is $908,776 for the President and CEO and $366,427 for the Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. The contract of Daniel Adam provide that, in the event of termination initiated by the Corporation with cause, the Vice-President, Exploration, Mr. Adam will not receive any compensation including his retention payment. Following the resignation of Mr. Adam, he will receive his salary during the notice of 60 days but nothing for his retention payment. In the event of termination initiated by the Corporation without cause, the compensation (including the salary and the annual bonus) will be determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee at their discretion and following the law. His retention payment will be given to him prorated to the number of months he worked. If Mr. Adam becomes invalid, or dies before the termination date of his contract, he or his succession will receive the retention payment prorated to the number of months he worked. All his options exercisable or that will become exercisable before the expiry term of 60 days will become vested. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that the termination occurred on the last working day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation is $183,333 for the Vice-President, Exploration. Change of Control Agreements The Corporation has also entered into an agreement with the Executive Chairman of the Board and with each of the Named Executive Officers in case of a change of control. For the Named Executive Officers: In the event that, during a three-year period after the date of a “change of control”, the employment contract of Nicole Veilleux was to be terminated by her resignation for valid cause or by the severing by the Corporation of the employment relationship binding her to the Corporation for cause other than serious cause or his permanent incapacity, then the Corporation shall pay her, in addition to the payment of any amount owed to her as unpaid salary and vacation accumulated but not yet taken on the termination date, within 30 days of the termination date, a lump sum equivalent to twice her total average annual compensation (total compensation is defined as all the components which have monetary value and, without limiting the scope of the foregoing, any salary, bonuses (applicable for the period, regardless of whether they are calculated at that time), benefits, insurance, based on the average annual amount of total compensation for the two full calendar years preceding the termination date, minus applicable deductions. Also, all the options held by the Named Executive Officer will become vested on the termination date and thereupon may be exercised. Moreover, and notwithstanding the provisions contained in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan and the conditions of the options held by the Named Executive Officer, the maturity dates of the options thus exercisable will be those initially stipulated, but without exceeding three years after the termination date. The change of control agreements will end upon the termination of the Named Executive Officer within the Corporation if it occurs before the occurrence of a change of control. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that a change of control occurred on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation, is $500,932 for the Financial Director. That amount includes the options annual average value attributed during the last two years. In the event that following termination of employment, amounts are payable to a Named Executive Officer pursuant to an employment contract and a change of control agreement, the Corporation would only have to pay the greater of the two amounts for the Financial Director. 110 The contracts of Paul Carmel and Pierre Rougeau provide that, after a change of control, if the contract is terminated within six (6) months following the change in control, Mr. Carmel and Mr. Rougeau will be entitled to the basic payments (accrued base salary, accrued expenses and vacation), to an indemnity in lieu of notice representing three (3) times the base salary at the time of the termination of the agreement (two (2) times in the case of Mr. Rougeau), the entitlement under the annual bonus plan, the whole minus applicable deductions and the same level of group insurance benefits he was receiving or entitled to receive for three (3) years (one (1) year in Mr. Rougeau’s case) following the date of termination. All un-vested options held by the executive on the date of termination will automatically vest on this day. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that a change of control occurred on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation, is $1,213,164 for the President and Chief Executive Officer and $606,427 for the Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. The contract of Daniel Adam provides that, after a change of control, if the contract is terminated within twelve (12) months following the change in control, Mr. Adam will be entitled to the entire payment of his retention payment. All un-vested options held by the executive on the date of termination will automatically vest on this day. If the contract is terminated after the period of twelve (12) months, following a change of control, Mr. Adam will be entitled to receive his retention payment prorated to the number of months he worked. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that a change of control occurred on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation, is $283,333 for the Vice-President, Exploration. For the Executive Chairman of the Board (the “Executive”): (a) In case of a change of control: In the event that the Executive’s appointment as Chairman of the Board is terminated by the Corporation (including, without limitation, if the Executive does not stand for election or is not elected a director of the Corporation) or the Executive resigns from his position as Executive Chairman of the Board, either (1) at the time of, or within 12 months following, the occurrence of a transaction or event constituting a Change of Control, or (2) within 6 months prior to the occurrence of a transaction or event constituting a Change of Control, in each case (if applicable) whether or not the Executive remains non-executive Chairman of the Board or a director of the Corporation, the Executive will be entitled to the payments and benefits set out hereafter: (a) his annual base salary accrued and unpaid up to and including the date of termination; (b) any annual bonus plan payment to which the Executive may be entitled as of the date of termination; (c) a severance payment equal to one (1) time the Executive’s annual base salary; (d) his accrued expenses up to and including the date of termination. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that a change of control occurred on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation, is $270,000 for the Executive Chairman of the Board. (b) In case of a termination other than under a change of control: In the event of the termination of the Executive’s appointment as Executive Chairman other than under a change of control, either by the Corporation or by the Executive’s resignation from his position as the Executive Chairman of the Board, (in each case, if applicable, whether or not the Executive remains non-executive Chairman of the Board or a director of the Corporation), the Executive will be entitled to receive the following compensation: (a) his annual base salary accrued and unpaid up to and including the date of termination; (b) any annual bonus plan payment to which the Executive may be entitled as of the date of termination; (c) his accrued expenses up to and including the date of termination. 111 There would not be any amounts owed to the Executive Chairman of the Board following a termination on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation. In all of the cases noted above, a change of control occurs when: (i) another party acquires, directly or indirectly, alone or with any person acting in concert with him, more than 33 1/3% of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation, (ii) after a takeover bid, a public offer of exchange, a merger, an arrangement, another form of business combination, a sale of assets of the Corporation or a contested election, or any combination of these transactions, the persons who are directors of the Corporation immediately prior to these transactions cease, after these transactions, to represent the majority of the directors on the Board, or on the Board of Directors of any parent Corporation or successor of the Corporation, or (iii) the shareholders of another entity hold more than 33 1/3% of the outstanding voting securities of the entity resulting from a merger, arrangement or other form of business combination with the other entity. Human Resources and Compensation Committee The Board has a Human Resources and Compensation Committee composed entirely of independent directors (Composition is described in Part VIII of the Corporation’s Annual Information Form). The Human Resources and Compensation Committee meets at least once a year to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of Corporation’s employees, executive officers and directors. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee takes into consideration the responsibilities and workload of executive officers in formulating its recommendations and favors giving key personnel competitive compensation in order to keep them with the Corporation. Each member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee has been in a senior leadership position in various organizations, and in those capacities obtained direct experience relevant to executive compensation, and has the skills and experience that enable the Human Resources and Compensation Committee to make decisions on the suitability of the Corporation’s compensation policies and practices. Until August 1, 2013, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Corporation was composed of Mr. Sam Minzberg, Mr. Michael Pesner and Mr. Réjean Houle. As of December 31, 2013, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee was composed of Mr. James Gill, Mr. Michael Pesner and Mrs. Elaine Ellingham. The compensation of the Executive Chairman of the Board, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers is determined by the Board of Directors following recommendations by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. As the Board of Directors establishes the salaries of executive officers, it should be noted that the Executive Chairman of the Board and the President and Chief Executive Officer abstain from the discussion and the ensuing decision concerning their total compensation arrangements. Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee The Board has a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which meets at least once a year. Since May 9, 2013, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has been composed entirely of independent directors. As of November 6, 2013, the Committee was composed of Elaine Ellingham, Michael Pesner and René Marion, all of whom are independent directors. Prior to May 9, 2013, the executive Chairman was a member of this Committee. Mr. Réjean Houle, an independent director, was a member of this Committee between May 9, 2013 and his resignation October 21, 2013. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee’s mandate is to evaluate every aspect of the Corporation’s governance practices. In particular, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee examines the effectiveness of the Corporation’s governance practices at regular intervals, and reviews the role and the mandate of the Board and its committees. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the responsibility for identifying new candidates for Board nomination. Comprised of all independent directors, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding selection criteria for directors, and periodically reviews the criteria the Board has adopted, as the case may be. 112 When candidates are needed, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee looks for candidates with varied backgrounds, who can contribute to the overall performance of the Board, and who have demonstrated integrity, independence, experience and leadership in the past. Directors and members of senior management may recommend a candidate to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee if he or she believes that the individual possesses the required abilities to successfully perform the duties of a director. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for conducting an interview with the candidate, from which it will form recommendations that will then be given to the Board of Directors. Audit Committee The Board has an Audit Committee and at year end it was composed of Michael Pesner, René Marion and James Gill, all independent directors as defined in National Instrument 52-110 Audit Committees (“NI 52-110”). The information on the Audit Committee is presented in Part VIII of the Corporation’s Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2013, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The Audit Committee is a standing committee of the Board of Directors whose primary function is to carry out a detailed and thorough review of audit matters, to be responsible for the oversight of the work of any accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit or review services for the Corporation (including resolution of disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial reporting), to consider and approve related party transactions and to offer the Corporation’s auditors, shareholders and employees a direct link to the non-executive directors. This Committee will assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information which will be provided to the shareholders and others, the internal auditing and disclosure controls and procedures, the audit process, and adherence to applicable laws and regulations. In carrying out its duties, the Committee will apply reasonable materiality standards to all matters under review. Environmental, Health and Safety Committee On December 8, 2010, the Board of Directors created the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee, composed of a majority of independent directors. At year end, 2013, the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee was composed of René Marion, James Gill and Paul Carmel. Previously, Elaine Ellingham and Réjean Houle were members of the Committee. The Environmental, Health and Safety Committee is responsible for evaluating whether the Corporation’s current environmental, health and safety practices are appropriate, for ensuring that these practices are standardized across all of the Corporation’s divisions, and for making recommendations when appropriate. The Chairman of the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee is responsible for providing the Board of Directors with an account of the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee. D.

Following the approval and adoption of the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan in May 2012, options are no longer granted under the Share Option Plan and all grants of awards are now made under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2013, options for the acquisition of a total of 934,850 common shares under the Share Option Plan were outstanding and with exercise prices ranging from $3.16 to $12.03 per share, representing approximately 2.4% of the common shares issued and outstanding on such date. As at December 31, 2013, options to acquire a total of 2,505,100 common shares had been granted under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan and with exercise prices ranging from $1.08 to $6.98 per share, representing approximately 6.3% of the common shares issued and outstanding on such date, leaving a balance of 519,660 available options to be issued by the Board of Directors pursuant to the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan, as indicated in the table below. As at April 22, 2014, a balance of 1,010,060 options was available to be issued. Information regarding share option plans as at December 31, 2013 Number of shares to be Weighted-average Number of shares issued upon exercise of exercise price of available for future outstanding options outstanding options grants under the plan Share Option Plans 3,439,950 $3.81 519,660 (approved by the holders) During the year 2013, one option holder exercised a total of 30,000 options. 115 Information regarding options outside the share option plans as at December 31, 2013 Number of shares issued Weighted-average outside the share option exercise price of options plans Outside the Share Option Plans 324,675 $6.61 (not approved by the holders) The total number of common shares reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to Awards (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) (including the common shares issuable upon exercise of the options granted under the Share Option Plan of the Corporation) shall not exceed a number of common shares equal to ten percent (10%) of the total issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation at the time of granting of Awards (on a non-diluted basis) or such other number as may be approved by the TSX and the shareholders of the Corporation from time to time. Options are no longer granted under the Share Option Plan and all grants of awards are now made under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan. Any increase in the issued and outstanding common shares (whether as a result of exercise of Awards or otherwise) will result in an increase in the number of common shares that may be issued on Awards outstanding at any time and any increase in the number of Awards granted will, upon exercise, make new grants available under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan provides that the aggregate number of common shares of the Corporation (a) issued to insiders and associates of such insiders under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan or any other proposed or established share compensation arrangement within any one-year period and (b) issuable to insiders and associates of such insider at any time under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan or any other proposed or established share compensation arrangement, shall not in each case exceed ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation. Awards granted or awarded under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan may not be assigned or transferred with the exception of an assignment made to a personal representative of a deceased Participant. The Board of Directors may in its sole discretion, appoint from time to time one or more entities to act as administrative agent to administer the Awards under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Board of Directors will not provide financial assistance to Participants (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) to assist them in exercising their Awards, provided, however, that the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, amend the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan to authorize the administrator under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan to make arrangements to provide a form of financial assistance to the Participants. The Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan is managed by the Board of Directors which establishes the terms of the option grants, including the exercise price, provided however, that the exercise price is not lower than the market price, as determined by the closing asked price of the common shares on the TSX on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant. The options granted under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan are vested or become subject to exercise according to the terms established by the Board of Directors at the time of grant. If the expiry date falls during a blackout period (during any period when the Corporation’s policies do not permit an option holder to exercise an option) or within ten business days following the last day of the blackout period, then the expiry date will be the last day of this ten business day period. Following the termination without cause of an option holder, the options that remain unexercised must be exercised within 60 days in the case of the termination without cause or resignation, 1 year in the case of death, 3 years in the case of disability or injury and 3 years in the case of early retirement. The Board of Directors has the discretionary power to modify these terms and periods, provided that options cannot expire later than 10 years from the date on which they were granted. 116 If at any time after the grant of an Award to any Participant and prior to the expiration of the term of such Award, the Common Shares shall be reclassified, reorganised or otherwise changed, the Corporation shall consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into another corporation (the corporation resulting or continuing from such consolidation, merger or amalgamation being herein called the “Successor Corporation”), the Participant shall be entitled to receive upon the subsequent exercise or vesting of such Award, in accordance with the terms thereof and shall accept in lieu of the number of Shares then subscribed for but for the same aggregate consideration payable therefore, the aggregate number of shares of the appropriate class or other securities of the Corporation or the Successor Corporation (as the case may be) or other consideration from the Corporation or the Successor Corporation (as the case may be) that such Participant would have been entitled to receive as a result of such reclassification, reorganization or other change of shares or, as a result of such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, if on the record date of such reclassification, reorganization or other change of shares or the effective date of such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, as the case may be, such Participant had been the registered holder of the number of Shares to which such Participant was immediately theretofore entitled upon such exercise or vesting of such Award. If, at any time after the grant of an Award to any Participant and prior to the expiration of the term of such Award, the Corporation shall make a distribution to all holders of Shares or other securities in the capital of the Corporation, or cash, evidences of indebtedness or other assets of the Corporation (excluding an ordinary course dividend in cash or shares, but including for greater certainty shares or equity interests in a subsidiary or business unit of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries or cash proceeds of the disposition of such a subsidiary or business unit), or should the Corporation effect any transaction or change having a similar effect, then the price or the number of Shares to which the Participant is entitled upon exercise or vesting of Award shall be adjusted to take into account such distribution, transaction or change. The Board of Directors shall determine the appropriate adjustments to be made in such circumstances in order to maintain the Participants' economic rights in respect of their Awards in connection with such distribution, transaction or change. The Board of Directors may amend the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) or any Award from time to time without the consent of the Participants provided that such amendment shall: not adversely alter or impair any Award previously granted; be subject to any regulatory approvals including, where required, the approval of the TSX; and be subject to shareholder approval, where required, by law or the requirements of the TSX, provided that shareholder approval shall not be required for the following amendments and the Board of Directors may make any changes which may include but are not limited to: a) amendments of a "housekeeping" nature; b) a change to the vesting provisions of any Award; c) the introduction or amendment of a cashless exercise feature payable in securities, whether or not such feature provides for a full deduction of the number of underlying securities from the Plan (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) reserve; d) the addition of a form of financial assistance and any amendment to a financial assistance provision which is adopted; and e) the addition of a deferred or restricted share unit or any other provision which results in Participants receiving securities while no cash consideration is received by the issuer. 117 The Board of Directors shall be required to obtain shareholder approval to make the following amendments: any change to the maximum number of Shares issuable from treasury under the Plan; any amendment which reduces the exercise price of any Award, as applicable, after such an Award has been granted or any cancellation of an Award and the substitution of that Award by a new Award with a reduced price; any amendment which extends the expiry date of any Award, or the Restriction Period (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) of any Restricted Share Units (RSU) beyond the original expiry date, except in case of an extension due to a Black-Out Period (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan); any amendment which would permit a change to the Eligible Participants (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan), including a change which would have the potential of broadening or increasing participation by Insiders; any amendment which would permit any Award granted under the Plan to be transferable or assignable by any Participant; any amendment which increases the maximum number of Shares that may be issued to (i) Insiders (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) and Associates (as defined in the Omnibus Long- Term Incentive Plan) of such Insiders; or (ii) any one Insider and Associates of such Insider under the Plan and any other proposed or established Share Compensation Arrangement (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) in a one-year period; any amendment to the amendment provisions of the Plan, provided that Shares held directly or indirectly by Insiders benefiting from the amendments shall be excluded when obtaining such shareholder approval. Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in the Plan, in a Grant Agreement (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) contemplated herein, but subject to any specific provisions contained in any Employment Agreements (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan), in the event of a Change in Control under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan, a reorganization of the Corporation, an amalgamation of the Corporation, an arrangement involving the Corporation, a take-over bid (as that term is defined in the Securities Act (Québec)) for all of the Shares or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may make such provision for the protection of the rights of the Participants as the Board of Directors in its discretion considers appropriate in the circumstances, including, without limitation, changing the Performance Criteria and/or other vesting conditions for the Awards and/or the date on which any Award expires or the Restriction Period, the Performance Period, the Performance Criteria and/or other vesting conditions for the Awards. The Board of Directors may, by resolution, advance the date on which any Award may be exercised or payable or, subject to applicable regulatory provisions and shareholder approval, extend the expiration date of any Award, in the manner to be set forth in such resolution provided that the period during which an Option (as defined in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan) or a Share Appreciation Rights (SAR) is exercisable or RSU is outstanding does not exceed ten (10) years from the date such Option or SAR is granted in the case of Options and SARs and three (3) years after the calendar year in which the award is granted in the case of RSUs. The Board of Directors shall not, in the event of any such advancement or extension, be under any obligation to advance or extend the date on or by which any Option or SAR may be exercised or RSU may be outstanding by any other Participant. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee may, by resolution, but subject to applicable regulatory approvals, decide that any of the provisions hereof concerning the effect of termination of the Participant's employment shall not apply for any reason acceptable to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. 118 The Board of Directors may, subject to regulatory approval, discontinue the Plan at any time without the consent of the Participants provided that such discontinuance shall not materially and adversely affect any Awards previously granted to a Participant under the Plan. The table below describes the share options exercised during the financial year ended December 31, 2013 by Named Executive Officers and Directors and the aggregate value realized on unexercised options at Year-End. Options Exercised by Named Executive Officers and Directors during the Most Recently Completed Financial Year Ended December 31, 2013 No options were exercised by Named Executive Officers and Directors during the most recently completed financial year ended December 31, 2013. ITEM 7. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS A. Major Shareholders As of April 22, 2014, to the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Corporation, Oxbridge Bank & Trust SCC (“Oxbridge”), an entity ultimately controlled by H. Greg Chamandy, a member of the Board of the Corporation and Chairman of the Board, is one of the two shareholders, directly or indirectly, beneficially owning or controlling over more than 5% of the outstanding common shares of the Corporation. Oxbridge, with its affiliates, beneficially owns or controls directly or indirectly 5,016,363 common shares representing approximately 12.67% of the outstanding common shares of the Corporation (excluding common shares underlying outstanding options). See “ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES – E. Share Ownership” above. The other shareholder is Lloyd I. Miller III who beneficially owns or controls directly or indirectly 3,656,931 common shares representing 9.2% of the outstanding common shares of the Corporation. Mr. Chamandy and Oxbridge became a shareholder of the Corporation in 2009. Mr. Chamandy or Oxbridge does not have any different voting rights compared with the Corporation’s other shareholders. As of April 22, 2014, a total of 7,227,954 shares of the Corporation’s common shares, representing 18.25% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation’s common shares, were held by a total of 121 U.S. record holders. The Corporation is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any foreign government or by any other natural or legal person, severally or jointly. The Corporation has no knowledge of any arrangement that may, at a subsequent date, result in a change of control of the Corporation. B. Related Party Transactions A Related Party Transaction is any transaction between the Corporation and (a) enterprises that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, control or are controlled by, or are under common control with, the Corporation; (b) associates; (c) individuals owning, directly or indirectly, an interest in the voting power of the Corporation that gives them significant influence over the Corporation, and close members of any such individual’s family; (d) key management personnel, that is, those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Corporation, including directors and senior management and close members of such individuals’ families; and (e) enterprises in which a substantial interest in the voting power is owned, directly or indirectly, by any person described in (c) or (d) or over which such a person is able to exercise significant influence. 119 Throughout the year 2013, and until the date of this Annual Report, certain Related Party Transactions occurred with the Corporation, as described below: Oxbridge Bank & Trust SCC On May 12, 2009, Oxbridge announced that it had acquired common shares of the Corporation and that, together with its joint actors, it owned and controlled an aggregate of approximately 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation. On November 24, 2009, Oxbridge amended its public disclosure related to the Corporation, and announced that it had acquired common shares from a private investor and that, subject to the completion of such acquisition, Oxbridge, together with its joint actors, would own and control common shares and options to purchase common shares representing an aggregate amount of approximately 19.49% of the issued and outstanding common shares (excluding common shares underlying outstanding options). Oxbridge also indicated that it intended to engage in discussions with the Board and management of the Corporation, as well as other shareholders, regarding the Corporation, its prospects and potential means for enhancing shareholder value, including potential changes in the business, strategy or Board composition of the Corporation. On November 25, 2009, in a letter duly authorized by the Board of Directors of Oxbridge and delivered to Denis Arcand, Chairman of the Board, and to the other members of the Board, Mr. Chamandy outlined certain proposals from Oxbridge (the “Oxbridge Proposals”) including the addition of Elaine Ellingham, A. Michel Lavigne, Samuel Minzberg and Jean-Pierre Ouellet (the “Proposed Directors”) to the Board, all with a view to maximizing the Corporation’s potential value for all of its shareholders. On November 30, 2009, Oxbridge announced the completion of the acquisition of common shares announced on November 24, 2009. Based on the Oxbridge Proposals and the Board’s own independent review of the Proposed Director’s qualifications, credentials, expertise, and experience, the directors determined that there existed no impediment, legally or from a corporate governance perspective, to the Proposed Directors acting as directors of the Corporation or holding their proposed positions on the Board committees, for reasons of conflict of interests or otherwise, and that the Proposed Directors, together with the current directors, have the qualifications, credentials, expertise and experience to implement the execution of the contemplated strategic plan for the Corporation’s future growth. Accordingly, on December 15, 2009, the Board unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Corporation and all its stakeholders to call a meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation for the purposes of electing the Proposed Directors. In addition, Mr. Chamandy was appointed Chairman of the Board and Mr. Arcand was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Board. Finally, the Board approved and the Corporation executed a mutual undertaking whereby (A) Mr. Chamandy and Oxbridge, in their capacity as shareholders of the Corporation, have undertaken to vote, and to cause to be voted, all shares of the Corporation that they, or any person with whom they are acting jointly or in connection with the Corporation, control directly or indirectly, in favour of the election of the current directors of the Corporation, as directors of the Corporation at all meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation to be held prior to December 31, 2012, at which directors are to be elected; and (B) the Corporation has undertaken (i) to cause the Proposed Directors (or any replacement) to be included as nominees proposed by the Corporation to its shareholders for election at the meeting; (ii) to ensure that the Proposed Directors and one additional individual (the “Additional Director”) to be identified by Mr. Chamandy, duly authorized by Oxbridge, before the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation (or any replacement), be included as nominees proposed by the Corporation to its shareholders for election to the Board of Directors at all meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation at which directors are to be elected prior to December 31, 2011; and (iii) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of such Proposed Directors at such meetings in each case, provided that (x) there exists no impediment, legal or from a corporate governance perspective, to such replacement person or 120 Additional Director, as the case may be, acting as a director of the Corporation, for reasons of conflict of interest or otherwise, and (y) such replacement person or Additional Director, as the case may be, has the qualifications, credentials, expertise and experience to oversee the execution of the Corporation’s strategic plan for future growth together with the current directors, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Davies, Ward, Phillips & Vineberg On February 4, 2010, Director Samuel Minzberg, was elected a Director of the corporation by a majority of shareholders during a special meeting held for that purpose. Mr. Minzberg is a senior partner at the law firm Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP (“Davies”) and until August 1st, 2013, he was a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. In 2011, the Corporation paid fees to Davies in the amount of approximately $27 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered mainly in legal tax advices ($14 thousand, in 2010, mainly in connection with legal tax advice). Stikeman, Elliott On December 15, 2009, Sidney Horn was named as Corporate Secretary of the Corporation. Mr. Horn is a senior partner at the law firm Stikeman, Elliott LLP (“Stikeman”). Until his resignation as Corporate Secretary effective May 9, 2013, the Corporation paid fees to Stikeman in 2013 in the amount of approximately $65 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered mainly in connection with general matters. In 2012, the Corporation paid fees to Stikeman in the amount of approximately $333 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered mainly in connection with general matters and financings. In 2011, the Corporation paid fees to Stikeman in the amount of approximately $225 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered mainly in connection with general corporate matters, financings and the option agreement with Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. Oxbridge Aviation On May 14, 2009, Mr. H. Greg Chamandy was appointed as Director of the Corporation and subsequently Executive Chairman of the Board. Oxbridge Aviation is owned by Mr. H. Greg Chamandy. In 2011, the Corporation paid fees to Oxbridge Aviation in the amount of approximately $4 thousand for a meeting of the Board of Directors in Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec), ($3 thousand, in 2010). Subsequent Transaction See “ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION - B. Significant Change” for a discussion of the issuance of 7.0 million of common shares. C. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. 121 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information The following consolidated financial statements of the Corporation are attached to this Annual Report: Independent Auditor’s report of registered public accounting firm dated February 19, 2014 on Internal Control over financial reporting and on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as at December 31, 2013 and 2012, Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for its 2011 fiscal year, as required by the Accounting Standards Board of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. IFRS requires that all effective standards be retrospectively applied as of the reporting date, which for the Corporation is December 31, 2011. Several important differences exist between the new accounting methods applied under IFRS, the accounting methods previously applied under Canadian GAAP, and the accounting methods under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the financial information presented under IFRS is not comparable in all respects with financial information that is prepared in accordance with either Canadian GAAP or US GAAP. The Corporation has not declared or paid any dividends on its common shares since its incorporation. Richmont Mines has no current plans to pay dividends on its common shares. Its present policy is to retain earnings to finance its capital expenditures program. In the future, the Board of Directors may declare dividends according to its assessment of the financial position of the Corporation, taking into account its financing requirements for future growth and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant in the circumstances. The Corporation had no export sales during 2013. Except for the three litigation matters discussed above in the section entitled “Commitments and contingencies,” the Corporation knows of no active, pending or overtly threatened legal or arbitration proceeding to which the Corporation is a party or to which any of its properties is subject which may have, or has had in the recent past, a significant effect on the Corporation’s financial position or profitability. B. Significant Change The Corporation has reported a significant change since the date of the annual financial statements included: On April 3, 2014, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. (“Macquarie”) as lead underwriter, on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters, for the issuance of 7.0 million common shares of the Corporation, on a bought-deal basis, at a price of CAN$1.45 per share (the “Offering Price”) for gross proceeds of $10.15 million. The syndicate of underwriters also includes BMO Capital Markets, CIBC World Markets and Desjardins Securities. In addition, the underwriters have been granted an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1.05 million common shares from the Corporation (the “Over-Allotment Option”), exercisable in whole or in part at the Offering Price for a period of 30 days from closing of the Offering, for additional gross proceeds of up to approximately $1.52 million. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the total gross proceeds to Richmont will be $11.67 million. Richmont plans to use the net proceeds of the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. 122 According to the terms of the Offering, the Corporation’s common shares will be issued under a short-form prospectus to be filed in certain provinces of Canada, pursuant to the short-form prospectus system contemplated by National Instrument 44-101 – short form prospectus distributions. The Offering is expected to close on or about April 23, 2014, and is subject to certain conditions, including but not limited to the receipt of all necessary approvals including those of the TSX and the NYSE MKT.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION A. Share Capital Not applicable. B. Memorandum and Articles of Association The Corporation was incorporated pursuant to Part 1A of the Companies Act (Quebec) on February 12, 1981 (File number 1843-2286) under the name Ressources Minières Rouyn inc. by Article of Amendment filed February 10, 1987 the Corporation added the English version Rouyn Mining Resources Inc. and by another amendment filed with the Government of Quebec on June 20, 1991, the Corporation changed its name to Richmont Mines Inc., now governed by the Business Corporations Act (Quebec) (the “Business Corporations Act”) which replaced the Companies Act (Quebec) on February 14, 2011. The Articles of the Corporation are registered by the Government of Quebec in register S02473, folio 10. The Corporation has perpetual duration and no specific objects or purposes are set forth in its Articles or By-Laws. Amendments to Articles On February 14, 2011, the Companies Act (Quebec) was replaced by the new Business Corporations Act (Quebec) (the “Business Corporations Act”). The new Business Corporations Act provides that a corporation may hold shareholder meetings at a place outside of the Province of Quebec if the Articles so allow. The Board of Directors believes that it would be beneficial both to the Corporation and its shareholders to give the Board flexibility to permit shareholder meetings to be held outside of the Province of Quebec. The new Business Corporations Act further provides that if the Articles so allow, the directors of a corporation that is a reporting issuer may appoint one or more additional directors to hold office for a term expiring not later than the close of the annual shareholders meeting following their appointment, provided that the total number of directors so appointed may not exceed one third of the number of directors elected at the annual shareholders meeting preceding their appointment. The Board believes that it would be beneficial to the Corporation and its shareholders to give the Board flexibility to add directors who possess expertise and knowledge relevant to the Corporation’s operations from time to time between two annual shareholder meetings. Pursuant to its Articles, the business of the Corporation is managed by a Board of Directors composed of a maximum of eleven directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors, at its meeting held on March 28, 2011, adopted a resolution to amend the Articles approving the foregoing proposed amendments subject to the receipt of the approval of shareholders. In accordance with the Business Corporations Act, the proposed amendments to the Articles were approved by the shareholders at the Annual and Special General Meeting of shareholders held on May 13, 2011 (the “Meeting”). By-Laws The Corporation updated its General By-laws enacted by the Board of Directors on February 25, 1981, which have been amended since and are now known as the “By-laws”. To align the By-laws with the terminology and principles set out in the new Business Corporations Act as well as governance best practices, the Board of Directors elected to adopt the By-laws on April 5, 2012. (For more information, see Exhibit 1.3 of 2011 Annual Report). 126 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan The Board of Directors has approved the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan") of the Corporation, (a copy of which has been disclosed in Exhibit "4.2" of 2011 Annual Report), and approved by the shareholders of the Corporation. The Omnibus Plan was drafted to comply with the policies of the TSX and remains subject to any requirements the NYSE MKT may have for the Omnibus Plan to be in compliance with the NYSE standards. The following information is intended as a summary of the Omnibus Plan, and is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed provisions of the Omnibus Plan in the form disclosed as Exhibit "4.2" in 2011 Annual Report. C. Material Contracts Private Placements In October 2011, Richmont completed a private placement of 980,500 common shares at CAN$10.50 per share with the Fonds de solidarité FTQ and the Fonds régional de solidarité Abitibi-Témiscamingue, s.e.c. (collectively, the “Subscribers”), for a total cash consideration of $10.3 million. In addition, the private placement entitled the Subscribers to 245,125 warrants to purchase additional Richmont common shares at an exercise price of $13.00 per common share before December 31, 2012. On February 1st, 2012, Richmont Mines completed a $10 million private placement with Mr. Bob Buchan and two members of his immediate family in the form of convertible debentures. The debentures which had a 5 year maturity with a 7.6% annual interest rate were convertible into Richmont common shares at a conversion price of $12.17 per share at the option of the holders at any time following the date of issuance. On September 24, 2012, Richmont Mines announced the immediate retirement of these debentures held by Mr. Bob Buchan and two members of his immediate family. On September 26, 2012, Richmont Mines Inc. completed a non-brokered private placement with four institutional funds, through which the Corporation issued 5.97 million common shares at CAN$4.35 per share for, a total cash consideration of $26 million. Some Directors and officers subscribed to the private placement for an amount representing less than 2% of the private placement. On June 17, 2013, Richmont Mines obtained a letter of offer for a senior credit facility for up to US$50 million from Macquarie Bank Limited (“MBL”) to advance the Island Gold Deep project. The US$50 million facility consisted of three tranches, all of which were subject to certain conditions being met prior to drawdown. The Corporation issued call warrants for the purchase of 1,250,000 Richmont shares to MBL upon closing of the facility agreement on August 23, 2013. The warrants had an exercise price of CAN$2.45 per share, and expire 3 years from the original date of their issue to MBL. A total of 812,500 warrants vested immediately upon closing of the facility agreement. The remaining 437,500 warrants were to have vested when the conditions to drawdown Tranche B had been fully met by the Corporation, and were cancelled upon the December 20, 2013 termination of the facility. Public Prospectus On April 3, 2014, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. (“Macquarie”) as lead underwriter, on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters, for the issuance of 7.0 million common shares of the Corporation, on a bought-deal basis, at a price of CAN$1.45 per share (the “Offering Price”) for gross proceeds of $10.15 million. The syndicate of underwriters also includes BMO Capital Markets, CIBC World Markets and Desjardins Securities. In addition, the underwriters have been granted an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1.05 million common shares from the Corporation (the “Over-Allotment Option”), exercisable in whole or in part at the Offering Price for a period of 30 days from closing of the Offering, for additional gross proceeds of up to approximately $1.52 million. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the total gross proceeds to Richmont will be $11.67 million. Richmont plans to use the net 127 proceeds of the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. According to the terms of the Offering, the Corporation’s common shares will be issued under a short-form prospectus to be filed in certain provinces of Canada, pursuant to the short-form prospectus system contemplated by National Instrument 44-101 – short form prospectus distributions. The Offering is expected to close on or about April 23, 2014, and is subject to certain conditions, including but not limited to the receipt of all necessary approvals including those of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange Market. Land and mining rights agreement In mid-October 2013, the Corporation announced that it had signed a land and mining rights agreement with Argonaut Gold Inc., owner of the Magino Gold Project that is adjacent to the Corporation’s Island Gold Mine. With this Agreement, the Corporation will secure mining rights below a depth of 400 metres on several claims to the south of the Island Gold Deep Project, and will acquire a claim which will extend the western boundary of its Island Gold Deep Project by a distance of 585 metres towards the west. In exchange, Argonaut will receive exploration and mining rights from surface to a maximum depth of 400 metres on certain Richmont claims that border the Magino Gold Project. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Corporation will receive a net payment of $2.0 million in cash from Argonaut upon completion of the land transactions. Amended and Restated Shareholders Rights Plan Introduction On March 28, 2011, the Corporation amended and restated the existing shareholder rights plan which was set to terminate in accordance with its terms in 2012 (the “Amended and Restated Rights Plan”). The Amended and Restated Rights Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Corporation at a meeting of shareholders held on May 31, 2011 (Reference is made at Item 19. in Exhibit 2.2 of 2011 Annual Report). Background A shareholder rights plan was adopted by the Corporation’s shareholders in 2002 and, in accordance with the terms set out at that time, the plan required ratification at the Corporation’s annual meetings in 2005, 2008 and 2011, and would expire in April 2012. In lieu of shareholders ratifying the plan in 2011 for one year only (the plan would have expired in 2012), the Board of Directors thought it was appropriate to bring the shareholder rights plan up to date. Consequently a new shareholder rights plan was approved by the shareholders at the Corporation’s annual and special meeting on May 13, 2011, subject to reconfirmation by shareholders every three years. The plan will be renewed on May 8, 2014. The primary objective of a rights plan is (a) to prevent creeping acquisition of control or an acquisition of control through a partial bid; (b) to provide adequate time to the Board of Directors and shareholders to properly consider and evaluate any unsolicited takeover bid without undue pressure; (c) to provide the Board of Directors and shareholders adequate time to value all of the assets of the Corporation and for the Corporation to undertake a value recognition program if necessary to demonstrate the value of one or more assets; (d) to provide the Board of Directors of the Corporation adequate time to explore and develop alternatives for maximizing shareholder value if an unsolicited takeover bid is made for the Corporation and to possibly allow competing bids to emerge; and (e) to provide every shareholder of the Corporation an equal opportunity to participate in such a bid and to ensure the equal treatment of all shareholders of the Corporation under such bid. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan encourages a potential acquiror to proceed either by way of a Permitted Bid (as defined in the Amended and Restated Rights Plan), which requires the takeover bid to satisfy certain minimum standards designed to promote fairness, or with the concurrence of the Board of Directors. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan is not intended to prevent takeover bids that treat shareholders of the Corporation fairly and has not been adopted in response to any proposal to acquire control of the Corporation. On the effective Date, one Right (as defined in the Amended and Restated Rights Plan) was issued and attached to each common share of the Corporation then outstanding, and one Right will be issued and attached to each common share of the Corporation subsequently issued. 128 In choosing to implement a rights plan, the Board of Directors of the Corporation considered the legislative framework in Canada governing takeover bids. Under provincial securities legislation, a takeover bid means an offer to acquire voting or equity shares of a corporation, where the shares subject to the offer to acquire, together with shares already owned by the bidder and any person or Corporation acting jointly or in concert with the bidder, aggregate 20% or more of the outstanding shares of a corporation, but does not include an offer to acquire if the offer to acquire is a step in an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or arrangement that requires approval in a vote of security holders. The Corporation has reviewed the Amended and Restated Rights Plan for conformity with current practices of Canadian companies with respect to shareholder protection rights plan. The Corporation believes that the Amended and Restated Rights Plan preserves the fair treatment of shareholders, is consistent with current best Canadian corporate practice and addresses institutional investor guidelines. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan contains substantially the same terms and conditions as the 2008 Rights Plan and has been updated to meet current best Canadian corporate practices. The existing legislative framework for takeover bids in Canada continues to raise the following concerns for shareholders of the Corporation: Time – Canadian securities laws permit a takeover bid to expire 35 days after it is initiated. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is of the view that this is not sufficient time to permit shareholders to consider a takeover bid and make a reasoned and unhurried decision as well as permit directors to evaluate a takeover bid, explore, develop and pursue alternatives which it believes are preferable to the takeover bid or which could maximize shareholder value, and make reasoned recommendations to the shareholders. Pressure to Tender - A shareholder may feel compelled to tender to a takeover bid which the shareholder considers to be inadequate out of concern that in failing to do so, the shareholder may be left with illiquid or minority discounted Common Shares. This is particularly so in the case of a partial takeover bid for less than all of the Common Shares, where the bidder wishes to obtain a control position but does not wish to acquire all of the Common Shares. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan provides the shareholder with a tender approval mechanism which is intended to ensure that the shareholder can separate the decision to tender from the approval or disapproval of a particular takeover bid. Unequal Treatment: Full Value - While existing Canadian securities legislation has substantially addressed many concerns in this regard, there remains the possibility that control of the Corporation may be acquired pursuant to a private agreement in which one or a small group of shareholders dispose of Common Shares at a premium to market price which premium is not shared with the other shareholders or through a partial bid that may be oppressive to the shareholders of the Corporation. In addition, a person may slowly accumulate Common Shares through stock exchange acquisitions which may result, over time, in an acquisition of control without payment of fair value for control or a fair sharing of a control premium among all shareholders. Summary The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan for the Corporation which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan. A shareholder or any other interested party may obtain a copy of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan by contacting the Corporate Secretary, 161 Avenue Principale, Rouyn-Noranda, Québec, J9X 4P6; telephone (819) 797-2465; fax (819) 797-0166, by consulting the Web Site SEDAR at www.sedar.com or by consulting the Corporation’s Web Site at www.richmont-mines.com. The terms of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan conform to the terms of plans now in place in many other Canadian public companies. 129 Effective Date The effective date of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is March 28, 2011 (the “Effective Date”). Term If the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is reconfirmed at a meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held on May 8, 2014, it will then be in effect until the end of the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to be held in 2017 unless the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is reconfirmed at that meeting by the shareholders. If the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is so reconfirmed, it will then need to be reconfirmed at every third annual meeting. If it is not reconfirmed it will terminate. Even if reconfirmed by the shareholders, it expires ten years after the Effective Date or in 2021, at which time a new plan can be adopted. Issue of Rights On the Effective Date, one Right was issued and attached to each Common Share outstanding of the Corporation and will be issued and attached to each Common Share of the Corporation subsequently issued. Rights Exercise Privilege The Rights will separate from the Common Shares and will be exercisable 10 trading days (the “Separation Time”) after a person has acquired, or commenced a takeover bid to acquire, 20% or more of the Common Shares, other than by an acquisition pursuant to a takeover bid permitted by the Amended and Restated Rights Plan (a “Permitted Bid”). The acquisition by any person (an “Acquiring Person”) of 20% of the Common Shares, other than by way of a Permitted Bid, is referred to as a “Flip-in Event”. Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person will become void upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event. Ten trading days after the occurrence of the Flip-in Event, each Right (other than those held by an Acquiring Person) will permit the purchase by holders of Rights, other than an Acquiring Person, of Common Shares at a 50% discount to their market price. The issue of the Rights is not initially dilutive. Upon a Flip-in Event occurring and the Rights separating from the Common Shares, reported earnings per share of the Corporation on a fully diluted or non-diluted basis may be affected. Holders of Rights not exercising their Rights upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event may suffer substantial dilution. Certificates and Transferability Prior to the Separation Time, the Rights are evidenced by a legend imprinted on certificates for the Common Shares and are not transferable separately from the Common Shares. From and after the Separation Time, the Rights will be evidenced by Rights certificates which will be transferable and traded separately from the Common Shares. Permitted Bid Requirements The requirements for a Permitted Bid include the following: the takeover bid must be made by way of a takeover bid circular; the takeover bid must be made to all shareholders of the Corporation as registered on the books of the Corporation, other than the Offeror; the takeover bid must be outstanding for a minimum period of 60 days and Common Shares tendered pursuant to the takeover bid may not be taken up prior to the expiry of the 60 day period and only if at such time more than 50% of the Common Shares of the Corporation held by shareholders, other than the Offeror, its affiliates and persons acting jointly or in concert and certain other persons (the “Independent Shareholders”), have been tendered to the takeover bid and not withdrawn; and 130 if more than 50% of the Common Shares held by Independent Shareholders are tendered to the takeover bid within the 60 day period, the Offeror must make a public announcement of that fact and the takeover bid must remain open for deposits of Common Shares for not less than 10 business days from the date of such public announcement. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan allows for a competing Permitted Bid (a “Competing Permitted Bid”) to be made while a Permitted Bid is in existence. A Competing Permitted Bid must satisfy all the requirements of a Permitted Bid except that it may expire on the same date as the Permitted Bid, subject to the requirement that it be outstanding for a minimum period of 35 days. Waiver The Board of Directors, acting in good faith, may, prior to the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, waive the application of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan to a particular Flip-in Event (an “Exempt Acquisition”) where the takeover bid is made by a takeover bid circular to all holders of Common Shares of the Corporation. When the Board of Directors exercises the waiver power for one takeover bid, the waiver will also apply to any other takeover bid for the Corporation made by a takeover bid circular to all holders of Common Shares prior to the expiry of any other bid for which the Amended and Restated Rights Plan has been waived. Additionally, the Board of Directors, acting in good faith, may waive the application of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan for any Flip-in Event by written notice delivered to the Rights Agent (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Rights Plan). Redemption The Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders (or holders of Rights if the Separation Time has occurred) voting in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for that purpose may redeem the Rights at $0.000001 per share. Rights will be deemed to have been redeemed by the Board of Directors following completion of a Permitted Bid, Competing Permitted Bid or Exempt Acquisition. Amendment Prior to the meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may make any changes to the Amended and Restated Rights Plan which the Board of Directors acting in good faith may deem necessary or desirable without the approval of any holders of Rights or Common Shares. After the meeting, the Board of Directors may amend the Amended and Restated Rights Plan with the approval of a majority vote of the votes cast by shareholders (or the holders of Rights if the Separation time has occurred) voting in person and by proxy at a meeting duly called for that purpose. The Board of Directors without such approval may correct clerical or typographical errors and, subject to approval at the next meeting of the shareholders (or holders of Rights, as the case may be) may make amendments to the Amended and Restated Rights Plan to maintain its validity due to changes in applicable legislation. Board of Directors The Amended and Restated Rights Plan will not detract from or lessen the duty of the Board of Directors to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Corporation. The Board of Directors, when a Permitted Bid is made, will continue to have the duty and power to take such actions and make such recommendations to shareholders as are considered appropriate. 131 Exemptions for Investment Advisors Investment advisors (for fully managed accounts), trust companies (acting in their capacities as trustees and administrators), statutory bodies whose business includes the management of funds and administrators of registered pension plans acquiring 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Corporation are exempted from triggering a Flip-in Event, provided that they are not making, or are not part of a group making, a takeover bid. Approval of the Directors The directors of the Corporation have unanimously adopted and approved the renewal of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan. In renewing the Amended and Restated Rights Plan, the directors concluded, for the reasons discussed above, that it was in the best interests of the Corporation and the shareholders to do so. The directors unanimously recommend that shareholders approve the renewal of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan by voting FOR the Rights Plan Resolution at the meeting. The directors believe that the Amended and Restated Rights Plan preserves the fair treatment of shareholders of the Corporation, is consistent with Canadian’s corporate practice and addresses institutional investor guidelines. Shareholder Approval The Amended and Restated Rights Plan is subject to confirmation and approval by the shareholders of the Corporation at the meeting of shareholders scheduled to May 8, 2014, failing which the Amended and Restated Rights Plan will terminate, all outstanding Rights (as defined in the Summary) will be null and void and the Corporation will no longer have any form of shareholder rights plan. The following Rights Plan Resolution must be passed by a simple majority of votes at the Meeting: “BE IT RESOLVED AS A RESOLUTION OF THE SHAREHOLDERS: 1. THAT the Amended and Restated Shareholder Rights Plan adopted by the Board of Directors of Richmont Mines Inc. (the “Corporation”) on March 28, 2011 on the terms of the Amended and Restated Shareholder Rights Plan dated as of March 28, 2011 between the Corporation and Computershare Investor Services Inc., as Rights Agent, and all Rights issued pursuant to such Plan, are hereby renewed, for a period ending on the close of business on the date on which the annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation is held in 2017; and 2. THAT any one director or officer be, and each of them is hereby authorized and directed, for and in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation, to execute and deliver or cause to be delivered all such documents, and to take any action which, in the opinion of that person, is necessary or desirable to give effect to this resolution.” D. Exchange Controls There are no governmental laws, decrees, regulations or other legislation in Canada that may affect the export or import of capital, or the remittance of interest, dividends or other payments to non-residents holders of the Corporation’s common shares, except that any remittance of dividends to United States residents is subject to a 15% withholding tax (5% if the shareholder is a corporation owning at least 10% of the common shares of the Corporation) pursuant to Article X of the reciprocal income tax treaty between Canada and the United States. 132 E. Taxation The following summary of the material Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable in respect of the common shares reflect the Corporation’s opinion. The tax consequences to any particular holder of common shares will vary according to the status of that holder as an individual, trust, corporation or member of a partnership, the jurisdiction in which that holder is subject to taxation, the place where that holder is resident and, generally, according to that holder’s particular circumstances. This summary is applicable only to holders who are resident in the United States, have never been resident in Canada, deal at arm’s length with the Corporation, hold their common shares as capital property and who will not use or hold the common shares in carrying on business in Canada. Special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a United States holder that is an issuer that carries on business in Canada and elsewhere. This summary is not exhaustive of all possible income tax consequences. It is not intended as legal or tax advice to any particular holder of common shares and should not be so construed. Each holder should consult his own tax advisor with respect to the income tax consequences applicable to him in his own particular circumstances. Disposition of common shares If a non-resident were to dispose of common shares of the Corporation to another Canadian corporation which deals or is deemed to deal on a non-arm’s length basis with the non-resident and which, immediately after the disposition, is connected with the Corporation (i.e., the non-resident and any person with whom the non-resident does not deal at arm’s length holds directly or indirectly shares representing more than 10% of the voting power and more than 10% of the market value of all issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation), the amount by which the fair market value of any consideration (other than any shares of the purchaser corporation) exceeds the paid-up capital of the common shares sold will be deemed to be taxable as a dividend paid by the purchasing corporation, either immediately or eventually by means of a deduction in computing the paid-up capital of the purchasing corporation, and subject to withholding taxes as described below. Under the Income Tax Act (Canada), a gain from the sale of common shares of the Corporation by a non-resident will not be subject to Canadian tax since the common shares of the Corporation are listed on a prescribed stock exchange, provided the shareholder (and persons who do not deal at arm’s length with the shareholder) have not held a “substantial interest” in the Corporation (25% or more of the shares of any class of the Corporation’s stock) at any time in the five years preceding the disposition. Generally, the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (1980) (the “Treaty”) will exempt from Canadian taxation any capital gain realized by a resident of the United States, provided that the value of the common shares is not derived principally from real property situated in Canada. Dividends In the case of any dividends paid to non-residents, the Canadian tax is withheld by the Corporation, which remits only the net amount to the shareholder. By virtue of Article X of the Treaty, the rate of tax on dividends paid to residents of the United States is generally limited to 15% of the gross dividend (or 5%, in the case of certain corporate shareholders owning at least 10% of the Corporation’s voting shares). In the absence of treaty provisions, the rate of Canadian withholding tax imposed on non-residents is 25% of the gross dividend. Stock dividends received by non-residents from the Corporation are taxable by Canada as ordinary dividends. If a non-resident holder disposes of common shares to the Corporation (unless the Corporation acquired the common shares in the open market in the manner in which shares would normally be purchased by any member of the public), this will result in a deemed dividend to the non-resident holder equal to the amount by which the consideration paid by the Corporation exceeds the paid-up capital of such stock. The amount of such dividend will be subject to withholding tax as described above. 133 Capital Gains A non-resident of Canada is not subject to tax under the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of a capital gain realized upon the disposition of a share of a class that is listed on a prescribed stock exchange unless the share represents “taxable Canadian property” to another holder thereof. A common share of the Corporation will be taxable Canadian property to a non-resident holder if, at any time during the period of five years immediately preceding the disposition, the non-resident holder, persons with whom the non-resident holder did not deal at arm’s length, or the non-resident holder and persons with he/she did not deal at arm’s length owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of the Corporation. In the case of a non-resident holder to whom shares of the Corporation represent taxable Canadian property and who is resident in the United States, American tax will be payable on a capital gain realized on such shares by reason of the Treaty unless the value of such shares is derived principally from real property situated in Canada or the non-resident holder previously held the shares while resident in Canada. However, in such a case, certain transitional relief under the Treaty may be available. Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of common shares of the Corporation by a United States Holder (as defined below) that holds the common shares as a capital asset. The discussion does not cover all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of common shares of the Corporation by particular shareholders, and does not address state, local, foreign or other tax laws. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to persons that own (directly or indirectly) 10 percent or more of the Corporation’s voting shares, nor does this summary discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of persons subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold the common shares as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for United States federal income tax purposes or persons whose functional currency is not the United States dollar). As used herein, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of the Corporation’s common shares that is (i) a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organised under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. The summary is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, as well as on the income tax treaty between the United States and Canada (the “Treaty”), all as currently in effect and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Distributions on common shares of the Corporation General. United States Holders receiving dividend distributions (including constructive dividends) with respect to common shares of the Corporation are required to include in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes the gross amount of such distributions to the extent that the Corporation has current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), without reduction for any Canadian income tax withheld from such distributions. Such income will be foreign source dividend income and generally will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. Canadian tax withheld from such distributions may be credited, subject to certain limitations, against the United States Holder’s United States federal income tax liability or, alternatively, may be deducted in computing the United States Holder’s United States federal taxable income by those who itemize deductions. (See more detailed 134 discussion in the section captioned “Foreign Tax Credit” below). To the extent that distributions exceed current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Corporation, they will be treated first as a return of capital up to the United States Holder’s adjusted basis in the common shares, and then as capital gain. Preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains are applicable to a United States Holder that is an individual, estate or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains for a United States Holder that is a corporation. The Corporation does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with United States Federal income tax accounting principles. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, dividends paid by foreign qualified corporations to non-corporate taxpayers will be taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains, rather than at the higher ordinary income tax rate. A foreign corporation such as the Corporation is a qualified corporation (i) if the corporation is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States which the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) determines is satisfactory and which contains an exchange of information provision, or (ii) to the extent that the dividends are paid with respect to stock that is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. The IRS has ruled that the Treaty is a satisfactory treaty for this purpose. Accordingly, dividends paid with respect to shares of the Corporation should be eligible for the reduced tax rate. Eligibility for the reduced tax rate is dependent on satisfying a holding period and certain other limitations. The reduced tax rate also cannot be claimed with respect to dividends that are included as investment income for purposes of the limitation on the deduction of investment interest. For tax years beginning after 2012, dividends paid to U.S. citizens and residents with modified adjusted gross income above $200,000 ($250,000 for joint returns) also will be subject to a 3.8% tax on net investement income. The 3.8% tax is imposed on the lesser of net investment income or the excess of modified adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single and head of household tax returns ($250,000 for joint returns). For estates and trusts the threshold applies at the top marginal bracket, which for 2014 starts at $12,150. There is an exemption for foreign trusts except to the extent the foreign trust has United States beneficiaries. Foreign Currency Dividends. Dividends paid in Canadian dollars will be included in income in a US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day the dividends are received by the United States Holder, regardless of whether the Canadian dollars are converted into US dollars at that time. If dividends received in Canadian dollars are converted into US dollars on the day they are received, the United States Holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the dividend income. A United States Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if it does not convert the amount of such dividend into U.S. dollars on the date of its receipt. Effect of Canadian Withholding Taxes. As discussed above in Taxation, Dividend, under current law payments by the Corporation to foreign investors are subject to a 25% Canadian withholding tax. The rate of withholding applicable to United States Holders that are eligible for benefits under the Treaty generally is reduced to a maximum rate of 15% (except for certain corporate holders). For United States federal income tax purposes, United States Holders will be treated as having received the amount of Canadian taxes withheld by the Corporation, and as then having paid over the withheld taxes to the Canadian taxing authorities. As a result of this rule, the amount of dividend income included in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes by a United States Holder with respect to the payment of dividends may be greater than the amount of cash actually received (or receivable) by the United States Holder from the Corporation with respect to the payment. Foreign Tax Credit Subject to certain limitations, a United States Holder who pays (or has withheld from distributions) Canadian income tax with respect to the ownership of common shares of the Corporation may be entitled, at the option of the United States Holder, to either a deduction or a tax credit for such foreign tax paid or withheld. United States Holders that are eligible for benefits under the Treaty will not be entitled to a foreign tax credit for the amount of Canadian taxes withheld in excess of the 15% maximum rate available under the Treaty, and with respect to which the United States Holder can obtain a refund from the Canadian taxing authorities. The limitation in foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. The rules 135 governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, United States Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances. United States Holders that are accrual basis taxpayers must translate Canadian taxes into United States dollars at a rate equal to the average exchange rate for the taxable year in which the taxes accrue, while all United States Holders must translate taxable dividend income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date received. This difference in exchange rates may reduce the U.S. dollar value of the credits for Canadian taxes relative to the United States Holder’s United States federal income tax liability attributable to a dividend. Disposition of common shares of the Corporation A United States Holder will recognize gain or loss from the sale of common shares of the Corporation equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received, and (ii) the shareholder’s tax basis in the common shares of the Corporation. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares are a capital asset in the hands of the United States Holder, which will be a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss depending upon the holding period of the United States Holder. Gains and losses are netted and combined according to special rules in arriving at the overall capital gain or loss for a particular tax year. Deductions for net capital losses are subject to significant limitations. For United States Holders that are not corporations, net capital loss may be offset against up to $3,000 of ordinary income each tax year, and any unused portion of such net capital loss may be carried over to be used in later tax years until such net capital loss is thereby exhausted. For United States Holders that are corporations (other than corporations subject to Subchapter S of the Code), an unused net capital loss may be carried back three years from the loss year and carried forward from the loss year to be offset against capital gains until the earlier of five years or the exhaustion of the net capital loss. As with dividends, for tax years beginning after 2012, capital gains of U.S. citizens and residents with modified adjusted gross income above $200,000 ($250,000 for joint returns) will be subject to a 3.8% tax on net investment income. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Payments of dividends or other proceeds with respect to common shares of the Corporation by a United States paying agent or other United States intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the United States Holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding at a rate of 28 per cent may apply to these payments if the United States Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of foreign or other exempt status or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its United States federal income tax returns. Certain United States Holders (including, among others, corporations) are not subject to backup withholding. United States Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining exemption. F .
