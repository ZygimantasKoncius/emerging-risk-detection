Item 1A. Risk Factors The following are certain risks that management believes are specific to our business. This should not be viewed as an all inclusive list or in any particular order. Future loan losses may exceed our allowance for loan losses ___________________________________________________________ We are subject to credit risk, which is the risk of losing principal or interest due to borrowers' failure to repay loans in accordance with their terms. A downturn in the economy or the real estate market in our market areas or a rapid change in interest rates could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers' ability to repay. This deterioration in economic conditions could result in losses to the Bank in excess of loan loss allowances. To the extent loans are not paid timely by borrowers, the loans are placed on non-accrual, thereby reducing interest income. To the extent loan charge-offs exceed our financial models, increased amounts charged to the provision for loan losses would reduce income. Rapidly changing interest rate environments could reduce our net interest _________________________________________________________________________ margin, net interest income, fee income and net income ______________________________________________________ Interest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are a large part of our net income. Interest rates are key drivers of our net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond the control of management. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. Rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in financial instrument maturities. Further, substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth particularly in construction lending, an important factor in the company's revenue growth over the 8 past two years. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease net interest income. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." Slower than anticipated growth in loans and deposits and new product and ________________________________________________________________________ service offerings could result in reduced net income ____________________________________________________ We have placed a strategic emphasis on growing our loans and deposit base and product offerings. Executing this strategy carries risks of slower than anticipated growth in loans, deposits and new products. Acquiring loans, deposits or products requires a significant investment of both financial and personnel resources. Lower than expected loan and deposit growth can decrease anticipated revenues and net income generated by those investments, and introducing new products could result in more additional expenses than anticipated and divert resources from current core operations. The financial services industry is very competitive ___________________________________________________ We face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services throughout our market area. Our competitors include other community banks, larger banking institutions, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than us. For a more complete discussion of our competitive environment, see "Business--Competition" in Item 1 above. If we are unable to compete effectively, we will lose market share and income from deposits, loans, and other products may be reduced. Decreased volumes and lower gains on sales of mortgage and SBA loans sold _________________________________________________________________________ could adversely impact net income _________________________________ We originate and sell mortgage and certain Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans. Changes in interest rates affect demand for our loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans. A decrease in the volume of loans sold can decrease our revenues and net income. Inability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff ___________________________________________________________________________ could adversely affect our revenues and net income __________________________________________________ We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit portfolios. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively effect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income. Limited geographic area and subject to concentration in those areas ___________________________________________________________________ The Company's profitability is dependent on the profitability of the Bank, which operates almost exclusively in the state of New Jersey, with substantial concentrations of its activities and assets primarily in New Jersey's Bergen and Essex Counties. In addition to adverse changes in general conditions in the United States, unfavorable changes in local economic conditions affecting the areas in which the Bank operates may have a significant adverse impact on operations of the Company. Highly regulated environment and may be affected by changes in laws and _______________________________________________________________________ regulations ___________ The Bank is subject to federal and state banking laws. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. As a public company, the Company is subject to legal restrictions and requirements, including reporting requirements, of the SEC, 9 including regulations promulgated following passage by Congress of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The regulations that most directly affect the Company and the Bank are in the areas of deposit gathering, lending, asset quality, capital adequacy, customer privacy, financial reporting and financial controls. The Company's policy is to fully comply with all regulatory requirements and the Company is periodically examined by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank is periodically examined by both the state banking regulators and the Federal Reserve Board. Non-compliance with any applicable regulation could have material adverse consequences to the Company. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
