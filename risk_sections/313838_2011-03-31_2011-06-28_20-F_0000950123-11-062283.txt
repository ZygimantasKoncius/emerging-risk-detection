SCEI has its corporate headquarters in Sony Corporations headquarters main building and leases its corporate buildings located in Tokyo, where administrative functions, product development, and software development are carried out. SCEA and SCEE lease their offices in the U.S. and Europe, respectively. SPEs corporate offices and motion picture and television production facilities are headquartered in Culver City, California, where it owns and operates a studio facility, Sony Pictures Studios, with aggregate floor space of approximately 1,546,000 square feet. SPE also leases office space and motion picture and television support facilities from affiliates of Sony Corporation and other third parties in various worldwide locations. SPEs film and videotape storage operations are located in various leased locations in the U.S. and Europe. SMEs corporate offices are headquartered in New York, NY where it leases office space from SCA. SME also leases office space from third parties in various locations worldwide. Most of SMEJs offices, including leased premises, are located in Tokyo, Japan. In December 2008, SCA renewed its option under a lease with a variable interest entity which is consolidated by Sony, for its corporate headquarters. Sony has the option to purchase the building at any time during the lease term, which expires in December 2015. The aggregate floor space of this building is approximately 723,000 square feet. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony ceased manufacturing at a total of six manufacturing sites, one in Japan and five outside of Japan. In addition, Epson Imaging Devices Corporations Tottori Plant was transferred to Sony in April 2010. The Sony Dothan Alabama plant, the Sony Slovakia, spol. s.r.o.-Nitra plant, and the Sony Espana S.A., Barcelona Technology Center have been removed from the table above. The Sony Dothan Alabama plant ceased manufacturing in September 2010. Sony sold 90.1 percent of its shares in the Sony Slovakia, spol. s.r.o.-Nitra plant to the Hon Hai Group in September 2010. In January 2011, Sony Espana S.A., Barcelona Technology Center was transferred to Ficosa International, S.A. and COMSA EMTE SL, both of which are headquartered in Spain. As a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake, operations at ten Sony group sites and facilities, including Sony Chemicals & Information Device Corporations Kanuma Plant and Sony Energy Devices Corporations Tochigi and Koriyama Plants were suspended in March 2011. These ten damaged sites had resumed or partially resumed their operations by May 30, 2011. 36 Table of Contents Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects OPERATING RESULTS Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2011 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2010 For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, consolidated operating income was significantly higher, 6.3 times the previous fiscal years amount, despite the large unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in consolidated operating income was driven primarily by improved results in the Networked Products & Services (NPS) segment due principally to the contribution of the game business. Improved results in the Consumer, Professional & Devices segment also contributed to the increase in consolidated operating income. A net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders was recorded, mainly due to a non-cash charge to establish a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in Japan. Sony realigned its reportable segments from the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, to reflect modifications to the organizational structure as of April 1, 2010, primarily repositioning the operations of the previously reported B2B & Disc Manufacturing segment. In connection with this realignment, the Consumer Products & Devices segment was renamed the Consumer, Professional & Devices (CPD) segment. The CPD segment includes televisions, digital imaging, audio and video, semiconductors and components as well as professional solutions (the B2B business which was previously included in the B2B & Disc Manufacturing segment). The equity results of S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD), a joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), are also included within the CPD segment. The disc manufacturing business previously included in the B2B & Disc Manufacturing segment is now included in All Other. The NPS, Pictures, Music and Financial Services segments remain unchanged. The equity earnings from Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) continue to be presented as a separate segment. In connection with this realignment, both the sales and operating income (loss) of each segment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 have been revised to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Operating Performance Fiscal year ended March 31 2010 2011 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,214.0 7,181.3  0.5 % Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies (30.2 ) 14.1  Operating income 31.8 199.8 +528.9 Income before income taxes 26.9 205.0 +661.8 Net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders (40.8 ) (259.6 )  Sales Sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 were 7,181.3 billion yen, a decrease of 0.5 percent compared to the previous fiscal year (year-on-year), primarily due to a decrease in sales in all segments except the CPD and NPS segments. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates significantly affected sales in all segments except the Financial Services segment. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. 37 Table of Contents During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the average rates of the yen were 84.7 yen against the U.S. dollar and 111.6 yen against the euro, which were 8.4 percent and 16.2 percent higher, respectively, than the previous fiscal year. Sales in the analysis of the ratio of cost of sales to sales, the ratio of research and development costs to sales, and the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA expenses) to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales (which excludes financial services revenue). This is because financial services expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and SGA expenses in the consolidated financial statements. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 decreased by 61.2 billion yen, or 1.3 percent year-on-year, to 4,831.4 billion yen, and improved from 76.7 percent to 75.7 percent as a percentage of sales. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) decreased by 5.2 billion yen, or 1.2 percent year-on-year, to 426.8 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 6.7 percent compared to 6.8 percent in the previous fiscal year. SGA expenses decreased by 43.1 billion yen, or 2.8 percent year-on-year, to 1,501.8 billion yen, mainly due to the impact of the appreciation of the yen and a decrease in personnel related costs, partially offset by an increase in advertising and publicity expenses. The ratio of SGA expenses to sales improved year-on-year from 24.2 percent to 23.5 percent. Gain on sale, disposal or impairment of assets and other (net) was 13.5 billion yen, compared with a loss of 43.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This improvement was mainly due to a 27.0 billion yen gain recognized as a result of Sony acquiring an additional 5 percent equity interest and a controlling interest including certain management rights in Game Show Network, LLC (GSN), which operates a U.S. cable network and online business. As a result, Sony remeasured its previously owned 35 percent equity interest in GSN which resulted in the recognition of the gain. Additionally, the previous fiscal year included impairment charges such as a 27.1 billion yen charge related to the impairment of LCD television assets* and a 7.8 billion yen charge related to the impairment of the small- and medium-sized amorphous thin film transistor (TFT) LCD fixed assets, which were partially offset by a 30.3 billion yen gain recognized from the sales of equity interests in certain television businesses in the Pictures segment. Refer to Notes 19, 24 and 25 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. * The loss of 27.1 billion yen on impairment, a non-cash charge recorded within operating income, primarily reflects a decrease in the estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets. Managements strategic plans updated in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 resulted in decreases in the assets estimated service periods and corresponding estimated future cash flows leading to the impairment charge. Sony has excluded the loss on impairment from restructuring charges as it is not directly related to Sonys ongoing restructuring initiatives. Sony defines restructuring initiatives as activities initiated by Sony, such as exiting a business or product category or implementing a headcount reduction program, which are designed to generate a positive impact on future profitability. Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Affiliated Companies Equity in net income of affiliated companies, recorded within operating income, was 14.1 billion yen compared to equity in net loss of 30.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Sony recorded equity in net income for Sony Ericsson of 4.2 billion yen compared to equity in net loss of 34.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income for S-LCD increased 6.8 billion yen to 7.2 billion yen. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income increased 168.0 billion yen year-on-year to 199.8 billion yen despite the large unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The significant increase in operating income was mainly due to an improvement 38 Table of Contents in operating results in the NPS and CPD segments. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony recorded charges of 11.9 billion yen, consisting principally of idle facility costs at manufacturing sites and an incremental provision for life insurance policy reserves, caused by the earthquake, resulting tsunami and related power outages that struck Eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 (the Great East Japan Earthquake). Furthermore, Sony incurred incremental expenses, including restoration costs (e.g., repair, removal and cleaning costs) directly related to the damages caused by the disaster to certain fixed assets including buildings, machinery and equipment as well as inventories at manufacturing sites and warehouses, in addition to charges for the disposal or impairment of fixed assets and inventories. These expenses amounted to 10.9 billion yen; however, Sony has insurance policies that cover certain damages to fixed assets and inventories as well as the associated restoration costs, which are expected to offset almost all of these losses and expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, as the recoveries from insurance claims are deemed probable. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, other income increased by 1.1 billion yen, or 2.6 percent, to 45.0 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 8.9 billion yen, or 18.3 percent year-on-year, to 39.8 billion yen. The net amount of other income and other expenses was income of 5.2 billion yen, an improvement of 10.1 billion yen year-on-year, primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of 9.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of 10.9 billion yen for the previous fiscal year. A net foreign exchange gain was recorded mainly due to gains related to the period end valuation on derivative contracts entered into by Sony for the purpose of effective global cash management. Interest and dividends in other income of 11.8 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, a decrease of 1.4 billion yen, or 10.7 percent year-on-year. On the other hand, interest recorded in other expenses totaled 23.9 billion yen, an increase of 1.4 billion yen, or 6.2 percent year-on-year. Income (Loss) before Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, income before income taxes increased 178.1 billion yen year-on-year to 205.0 billion yen, mainly as a result of the above-mentioned increase in operating income. Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony recorded 425.3 billion yen of income taxes, primarily resulting from recording a non-cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of 362.3 billion yen against deferred tax assets at Sony Corporation and its national tax filing group in Japan. Carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are evaluated on a tax jurisdiction basis and require a reduction by a valuation allowance if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. In Japan, Sony Corporation files a standalone tax filing for local tax purposes and a consolidated national tax filing with its wholly owned Japanese subsidiaries for national tax purposes. Sony Corporation and its national tax filing group in Japan are in a three year cumulative loss position in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), a three year cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, which is difficult to overcome, particularly given the relatively short tax loss carryforward period of seven years in Japan and the anticipated impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake on the near-term forecast for entities in Japan. Accordingly, Sony determined in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 that it was required under U.S. GAAP to establish a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in Japan. Refer to Note 21 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. The non-cash charge to establish a valuation allowance does not have any impact on Sonys consolidated operating income or cash flow, nor does such an allowance preclude Sony from using the loss carryforwards or other deferred tax assets in the future. It is also important to note that the establishment of this valuation allowance does not reflect a change in Sonys view of its long-term corporate strategy. 39 Table of Contents Net Income (loss) attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders, which excludes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 259.6 billion yen, a deterioration of 218.8 billion yen year-on-year. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 39.3 billion yen was recorded, a decrease of 14.5 billion yen year-on-year. This was mainly due to the income recorded at Sony Financial Holdings, Inc. (SFH), for which there is a noncontrolling interest of 40 percent. For details of operating results in the Financial Services segment, refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Basic and diluted net losses per share attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders were both 258.66 yen compared with basic and diluted net losses per share of 40.66 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Note 22 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 28 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Sales to outside customers increased 4.3 percent year-on-year. This was primarily due to higher LCD television sales resulting from a significant increase in unit sales that came mostly from the Asia-Pacific, Other Areas, and Japan and higher semiconductor sales resulting from strong performances of small- and medium-sized LCD panels and image sensors. The sales increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, lower components sales resulting from a decrease in sales of storage media affected by market contraction and a decrease in sales of optical disc drives driven by price competition. LCD television sales in Japan increased primarily due to both a program which provided consumers with a subsidy from the Japanese government and enhanced demand resulting from the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting in Japan which is scheduled to be completed by July 2011. The subsidy program ended on March 31, 2011. Operating income of 2.9 billion yen was recorded, compared to a loss of 53.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This improvement was driven primarily by an increase in gross profit due to higher sales, a decrease in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets and other (net), and a decrease in restructuring charges. These factors were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily associated with higher marketing expenses. In the previous fiscal year, a 27.1 billion yen non-cash charge related to the impairment of LCD television assets, which were not included in restructuring charges, was recorded. (Refer to Note 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.) Restructuring charges were 41.6 billion yen in the current fiscal year, compared with 75.9 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The current fiscal years restructuring charges included expenses of 11.6 billion yen related to the transfer to third parties of the Barcelona factory in Europe (executed in January 2011) and the impairment of related assets. Categories that favorably impacted the change in segment operating results (excluding restructuring charges and the above-mentioned LCD television asset impairment) include semiconductors, reflecting an increase in sales of image sensors, and professional solutions, reflecting an increase in sales of products such as digital cinema projectors. A category that unfavorably impacted the change in segment operating results (excluding restructuring charges) was LCD televisions, reflecting a decline in unit selling prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, despite rising unit sales. Below are the sales to outside customers by product category and unit sales of major product categories: Sales to outside customers by product category Figures in parentheses indicate the percentage contribution of each product category to the segment total.

Sales to outside customers decreased 1.2 percent year-on-year. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates offset increased sales mainly in PCs, which saw increased unit sales and an expanding market share in all regions, resulting in segment sales that were almost flat year-on-year. Operating income of 35.6 billion yen was recorded, compared to a loss of 83.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This improvement was mainly due to a significant improvement in the cost of sales ratio coupled with an increase in gross profit from higher sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. A category that favorably impacted the change in segment operating results (excluding restructuring charges) was the game business, reflecting significant cost reductions of PlayStation®3 (PS3) hardware and higher unit sales of PS3 software. Below are the sales to outside customers by product category, unit sales of each platform within the Game category, and unit sales of major products within the PC and Other Networked Businesses category: Sales to outside customers by product category Figures in parentheses indicate the percentage contribution of each product category to the segment total.

Sales to Outside Customers by Geographic Area Regarding sales to outside customers by geographic area for the CPD and NPS segments, combined sales decreased year-on-year by 8 percent in the U.S. and by 1 percent in Europe, and increased year-on-year by 8 percent in Japan, by 8 percent in non-Japan Asia-Pacific areas (Asia-Pacific), and by 13 percent in other geographic areas (Other Areas). Total combined sales in all areas increased year-on-year by 2 percent. In the U.S., sales of products such as small- and medium-sized LCD panels and digital cinema projectors increased while sales of products such as LCD televisions, storage media and digital ebook readers decreased. In Europe, sales of products such as LCD televisions and PCs increased while sales in the game business and sales of products such as home-use video cameras decreased. In Japan, sales of products such as LCD televisions, interchangeable single lens cameras, and small- and medium-sized LCD panels increased, while sales of products such as storage media decreased. In Asia-Pacific, sales of products such as LCD televisions, small- and medium-sized LCD panels and PCs increased. In Other Areas, sales of products such as LCD televisions increased. Sonys LCD television sales in Japan increased approximately 42 percent in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily as a result of both a program that provided consumers with a subsidy directly from the Japanese government after the purchase of qualifying products and enhanced demand resulting from the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting in Japan, which was scheduled to be completed by July 2011. The contribution of these factors to the growth in television sales was partially offset by continued price competition. The government subsidy program expired on March 31, 2011. Due to the relative size of the sales in Japan and outside of Japan, Sony anticipates that the impact of the expected contraction of the Japanese LCD television market after the end of the government subsidy program will be limited on a consolidated basis. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 55 percent of the CPD and NPS segments combined total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was in-house production and approximately 45 percent was outsourced production. Approximately 50 percent of the annual in-house production took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, home-use video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and storage media. Approximately 60 percent of the annual in-house production in Japan was destined for other countries. Production in Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 25 percent of the annual in-house production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the Americas, Europe and China. Production in China accounted for approximately 15 percent of the annual in-house production, approximately 50 percent of which was destined for other countries. Production in the Americas and Europe together accounted for approximately 10 percent of the annual in-house production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. 43 Table of Contents Pictures Pictures segment results presented below are a yen-translation of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 decreased 14.9 percent year-on-year, to 600.0 billion yen, primarily due to lower motion picture revenues and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 decreased approximately 8 percent. Motion picture revenues, also on a U.S. dollar basis, decreased approximately 13 percent year-on-year. While the current year benefitted from the strong performances of The Karate Kid, Grown Ups and Salt, international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment revenues declined significantly in comparison to the previous fiscal year which included 2012, Angels & Demons and Michael Jacksons This Is It. Television revenues, on a U.S. dollar basis, increased approximately 8 percent year-on-year, primarily due to higher subscription and advertising revenues from a number of international channels and higher U.S. revenues from cable and syndication programming. Operating income decreased 4.1 billion yen year-on-year, to 38.7 billion yen primarily due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Operating income decreased by less than 1 percent on a U.S. dollar basis. This decrease was due to lower home entertainment revenues from motion picture catalog product and the theatrical underperformance of How Do You Know, substantially offset by the higher television revenues mentioned above. In March 2011, SPE acquired an additional 5 percent equity interest and a controlling interest, including certain management rights, in GSN, which operates a U.S. cable network and online business. As a result, SPEs total equity interest in GSN increased to 40 percent. In accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations achieved in stages, Sony remeasured the 35 percent equity interest in GSN that it owned prior to the acquisition at the fair value of such interest at the time control was obtained. This resulted in the recognition of a gain of 27.0 billion yen, which is included in the current fiscal years operating income. The current fiscal years operating income also includes a gain on the sale of SPEs remaining equity interest in a Latin American premium pay television business (HBO Latin America). The total gain recognized from these two transactions was 30.3 billion yen. Refer to Notes 24 and 25 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In the previous fiscal year, there were gains recognized from the sale of a portion of SPEs equity interest in both HBO Latin America and GSN, as well as from the sale of all of its equity interest in a Central European premium pay television business (HBO Central Europe). The total gain recognized from these sales was 30.3 billion yen. As of March 31, 2011, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future, having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Music Music segment results presented below include the yen-translated results of Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a U.S.-based operation which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis, the results of Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ), a Japan-based music company which aggregates its results in yen, and the yen-translated consolidated results of Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC (Sony/ATV), a 50 percent owned U.S.-based consolidated joint venture in the music publishing business which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 decreased 9.9 percent year-on-year to 470.7 billion yen. This decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar, the especially strong performance of Michael Jackson product in the previous fiscal year and the continued contraction of the physical music market. Best selling titles during the current year included ikimono-gakaris IKIMONO BAKARI: MEMBERS BEST SELECTION, Susan Boyles The Gift, P!nks Greatest Hits ... So Far!!!, Michael Jacksons Michael and music from the cast of the hit television show Glee. 44 Table of Contents Operating income increased 2.4 billion yen year-on-year to 38.9 billion yen. Despite the decrease in sales, operating income increased due to decreases in marketing, restructuring and overhead costs. Financial Services The results of Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony Life) discussed below on the basis of U.S. GAAP differ from the results that SFH and Sony Life disclose separately on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 decreased 5.3 percent year-on-year to 806.5 billion yen, primarily due to a decrease in revenue at Sony Life. Revenue at Sony Life decreased 5.9 percent year-on-year to 696.7 billion yen, primarily due to a decrease in investment income. The decrease in revenue at Sony Life was partially offset by an increase in revenue from insurance premiums, reflecting a steady increase in policy amount in force. Operating income decreased 43.7 billion yen year-on-year to 118.8 billion yen, primarily due to a decrease in operating income at Sony Life. Operating income at Sony Life decreased 48.9 billion yen year-on-year to 117.7 billion yen. The decrease was mainly due to recording of net valuation gains from investments in convertible bonds in the general account in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 resulting from a significant rise in the Japanese stock market, and an increase in the provision of policy reserves for variable insurance in the separate account in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, driven primarily by a decline in the Japanese stock market. Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment The following charts show Sonys information of operations for the Financial Services segment alone and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and Sony without the Financial Services segment, including noncontrolling interests, are included in those respective presentations, then eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Fiscal year ended March 31 Financial Services segment 2010 2011 (Yen in millions) Financial services revenue 851,396 806,526 Financial services expenses 687,559 685,747 Equity in net loss of affiliated companies (1,345 ) (1,961 ) Operating income 162,492 118,818 Other income (expenses), net (966 ) 868 Income before income taxes 161,526 119,686 Income taxes and other 54,721 48,570 Net income of Financial Services 106,805 71,116 45 Table of Contents Fiscal year ended March 31 Sony without the Financial Services segment 2010 2011 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 6,381,094 6,388,759 Costs and expenses 6,484,642 6,326,233 Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies (28,890 ) 16,023 Operating income (loss) (132,438 ) 78,549 Other income, net 1,836 10,790 Income (loss) before income taxes (130,602 ) 89,339 Income taxes and other (34,081 ) 387,375 Net loss of Sony without Financial Services (96,521 ) (298,036 ) Fiscal year ended March 31 Consolidated 2010 2011 (Yen in millions) Financial services revenue 838,300 798,495 Net sales and operating revenue 6,375,698 6,382,778 7,213,998 7,181,273 Costs and expenses 7,151,991 6,995,514 Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies (30,235 ) 14,062 Operating income 31,772 199,821 Other income (expenses), net (4,860 ) 5,192 Income before income taxes 26,912 205,013 Income taxes and other 67,714 464,598 Net loss attributable to Sony Corporations Stockholders (40,802 ) (259,585 ) Sony Ericsson Sony Ericssons operating results are accounted for under the equity method and are not consolidated in Sonys consolidated financial statements, as Sony Corporations ownership percentage of Sony Ericsson is 50 percent. Sony Ericsson aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a euro basis. However, Sony believes that the following disclosure provides additional useful analytical information to investors regarding Sonys operating performance. Pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Sony Ericssons financial statements are included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F on pages A-1 to A-28. Sales for the year ended March 31, 2011 decreased 6.5 percent year-on-year to 6,034 million euro. This decrease was due to a decline in unit shipments as a result of a focus on high-end smartphones and a reduction in the size of the product portfolio. Income before taxes of 133 million euro was recorded for the current year, compared to a loss before taxes of 654 million euro in the previous year. This improvement was mainly due to the positive impact of a rise in the average selling price, a favorable product mix and improved cost structure. In addition, there was a benefit relating to the reversal of warranty reserves. As a result, Sony recorded equity in net income of Sony Ericsson of 4.2 billion yen for the current fiscal year, compared to equity in net loss of 34.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. 46 Table of Contents All Other Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 decreased 2.8 percent year-on-year, to 447.8 billion yen. The decrease in sales is mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower sales in the disc manufacturing business. Operating income of 8.6 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, compared to a loss of 5.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This improvement was mainly due to the fact that there were charges related to the withdrawal from the property management operation of an entertainment complex in Japan and the termination payments of the property lease contract in the previous fiscal year. In addition, losses from an unprofitable measuring systems business that were incurred in the previous fiscal year were not incurred in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 due to the sale of that business, which also contributed to the segment results improvement. The sale was completed at the end of March 2010. Restructuring As the global economy experienced a sharp downturn following the autumn of 2008, Sony announced major restructuring initiatives in January 2009. Sony continued to implement its restructuring initiatives during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. These initiatives included a review of Sony groups investment plan, the realignment of its manufacturing sites, the reallocation of its workforce, and headcount reductions, in order to reform Sonys operational structure and achieve improvements in competitiveness and profitability. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 67.1 billion yen, which includes 4.8 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, compared to 124.3 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the previous fiscal year. There were 7.9 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets in the previous fiscal year. Restructuring charges decreased by 57.3 billion yen or 46.1 percent year-on-year, as Sony implemented the major part of its fixed cost and total asset reduction plan in the previous fiscal year. Of the total 67.1 billion yen incurred in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, 38.3 billion yen were personnel related costs, primarily included in SGA expenses in the consolidated statements of income. These personnel related costs decreased 41.3 percent, compared to the previous fiscal year. Sonys total manufacturing sites were reduced from 57 sites as of December 31, 2008 to 46 sites as of March 31, 2010, and then to 41 sites as of March 31, 2011. As a result, Sony has been consolidating its manufacturing operations and increasingly utilizing the services of third party original equipment manufacturing (OEMs) and third party original design manufacturing (ODMs). Restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 were recorded mainly in the CPD segment. In the CPD segment, restructuring charges amounted to 41.6 billion yen, which include 3.6 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, compared to 75.9 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the previous fiscal year. Charges in the previous fiscal year included 7.3 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the CPD segment recorded 25.3 billion yen of restructuring charges related to personnel costs, comprising 66.2 percent of the total 38.3 billion yen personnel costs recorded on a consolidated basis. The CPD segments restructuring charges included expenses of 11.6 billion yen related to the transfer to third parties of the Barcelona factory in Europe and the impairment of related assets (executed in January 2011). With respect to television operations, Sony ceased manufacturing operations during the previous fiscal year at its Sony EMCS Corporations Ichinomiya TEC and at its Sony Baja California, S.A. de C.V.s Mexicali factory and completed the transfer to the Hon Hai Group of 90.0 percent of Sonys equity interest in Sony Baja California and certain manufacturing assets related to LCD televisions at Sony Baja Californias Tijuana Factory in Mexico, which mainly manufactures LCD televisions for the Americas region. The Tijuana Factory remains a key manufacturing site of Sony LCD televisions for the Americas region. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony completed the transfer to the Hon Hai Group of 90.1 percent of Sonys equity interest in the Nitra Factory in Slovakia and the transfer to Ficosa International, S.A. and COMSA EMTE SL of Sony Espana S.A.s Barcelona Technology Center. The Nitra plant remains a key manufacturing site of LCD televisions for the European region. In all segments, excluding the CPD segment, restructuring charges were recorded mainly due to headcount reductions through early retirement programs. 47 Table of Contents Restructuring charges discussed in Item 5, which include non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, are described in Note 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the average rates of the yen were 84.7 yen against the U.S. dollar and 111.6 yen against the euro, which was 8.4 percent and 16.2 percent higher, respectively, than the previous fiscal year. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations largely because the currency used in the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated or anticipated by Sony Corporation and by its subsidiaries transactions and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS to hedge their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges most of the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third party financial institutions. Most of these transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment. In the Financial Services segment, Sony uses derivatives primarily for Asset Liability Management (ALM). To minimize the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the CPD and NPS segments, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in other income and expenses. The notional amount and the net fair value of all the foreign exchange derivative contracts as of March 31, 2011 were 1,533.5 billion yen and a liability of 5.1 billion yen, respectively. Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2010 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2009 Sony realigned its segments from the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 to reflect the companys reorganization as of April 1, 2010. In connection with this realignment, both the sales and operating income (loss) of each segment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 and in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 have been revised to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. 48 Table of Contents Operating Performance Fiscal year ended March 31 2009 2010 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,730.0 7,214.0 −6.7 % Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies (25.1 ) (30.2 )  Operating income (loss) (227.8 ) 31.8  Income (loss) before income taxes (175.0 ) 26.9  Net income (loss) attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders (98.9 ) (40.8 )  Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased 6.7 percent year-on-year, to 7,214.0 billion yen, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in sales in the CPD segment, partially offset by an increase in revenue in the Financial Services segment. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the average rates of the yen were 91.8 yen against the U.S. dollar and 129.7 yen against the euro, which were 8.4 percent and 9.5 percent higher, respectively, year-on-year. Sales in the analysis of the ratio of cost of sales to sales, the ratio of research and development costs to sales, and the ratio of SGA expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales (which excludes financial services revenue). This is because financial services expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and SGA expenses in the consolidated financial statements. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 767.9 billion yen, or 13.6 percent year-on-year, to 4,892.6 billion yen, and improved from 78.5 percent to 76.7 percent as a percentage of sales. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) decreased by 65.3 billion yen, or 13.1 percent year-on-year to 432.0 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 6.8 percent compared to 6.9 percent in the previous fiscal year. SGA expenses decreased by 141.1 billion yen, or 8.4 percent year-on-year, to 1,544.9 billion yen, mainly due to the impact of the appreciation of the yen and a decrease in advertising and publicity expenses. The ratio of SGA expenses to sales increased year-on-year from 23.4 percent to 24.2 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets and other (net) was 43.0 billion yen, compared with a loss of 38.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This loss was primarily due to impairment charges including a 27.1 billion yen charge related to the impairment of LCD television assets*, a 7.8 billion yen charge related to the impairment of the small- and medium-sized amorphous TFT LCD fixed assets and other less significant losses on the sale, disposal or impairment of assets and other (net). These charges were partially offset by gains on the sales of assets including a 22.0 billion yen gain recognized from the sales of equity interests in HBO Latin America and HBO Central Europe. The loss recorded in the previous fiscal year was primarily the result of impairment charges including long-lived asset impairments mainly due to the downsizing and withdrawal from certain businesses as well as goodwill impairment charges. Refer to Notes 19, 24 and 25 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. * The 27.1 billion yen loss on impairment, a non-cash charge recorded within operating income, primarily reflects a decrease in the estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets. Managements strategic plans updated in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 resulted in decreases in the assets estimated service periods and corresponding estimated future cash flows leading to the impairment charge. Sony has excluded the loss on impairment from restructuring charges as it is not directly related to Sonys ongoing 49 Table of Contents restructuring initiatives. Sony defines restructuring initiatives as activities initiated by Sony, such as exiting a business or product category or implementing a headcount reduction program, which are designed to generate a positive impact on future profitability. Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Affiliated Companies Equity in net loss of affiliated companies, recorded within operating income, was 30.2 billion yen, an increased loss of 5.1 billion yen year-on-year. Sony recorded equity in net loss for Sony Ericsson of 34.5 billion yen compared to equity in net loss of 30.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income for S-LCD, a joint venture with Samsung, decreased by 6.5 billion yen year-on-year to 0.4 billion yen. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was 31.8 billion yen, an improvement of 259.6 billion yen year-on-year. Operating results improved significantly primarily due to an improvement in operating results in the Financial Services segment, as well as an improvement in the cost of sales ratio and a reduction in SGA expenses mainly in the CPD segment. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, other income decreased by 55.0 billion yen, or 55.6 percent, to 43.8 billion yen, while other expenses increased by 2.7 billion yen, or 5.9 percent year-on-year, to 48.7 billion yen. The net amount of other income and other expenses was an expense of 4.9 billion yen, a deterioration of 57.7 billion yen year-on-year, primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss of 10.9 billion yen that was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of 48.6 billion yen that was recorded in the previous fiscal year. A net foreign exchange loss was recorded mainly due to losses related to the period end valuation on derivative contracts entered into by Sony for the purpose of effective global cash management. Interest and dividends in other income of 13.2 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, a decrease of 9.1 billion yen, or 40.9 percent year-on-year. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in interest received resulting from a lower rate of return on investments in Japan and the U.S. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, interest recorded in other expenses totaled 22.5 billion yen, a decrease of 1.9 billion yen, or 7.7 percent year-on-year. Income (Loss) before Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, income before income taxes of 26.9 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 201.9 billion yen year-on-year, mainly as a result of the above-mentioned improvement in operating results. Income Taxes During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony recorded 14.0 billion yen of income taxes resulting in an effective tax rate of 51.9 percent. This effective tax rate was higher than the Japanese statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of equity investments reported net of income taxes, partially offset by lower effective tax rates on profits in the insurance business of the Financial Services segment. In the previous fiscal year, Sony recorded 72.7 billion yen of income tax benefit resulting in an effective tax rate of 41.6 percent. This income tax benefit was mainly due to a loss before income taxes and the partial reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, due to a change in the tax regulations in Japan to treat 95 percent of the dividends from overseas subsidiaries as non-taxable income, partially offset by the impact of equity in net loss reported net of income taxes, the reversal of certain deferred tax assets, and an increase in valuation allowance. 50 Table of Contents Net Income (loss) attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders, which excludes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 40.8 billion yen, a 58.1 billion yen improvement year-on-year. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 53.8 billion yen was recorded, as compared to net loss of 3.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This was mainly due to the income recorded at SFH, for which there is a noncontrolling interest of 40 percent, primarily as a result of the improvement in net valuation gains from investments in convertible bonds in the general account at Sony Life due to the improved situation in the Japanese stock market. Basic and diluted net losses per share attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders were both 40.66 yen compared with net loss per share of 98.59 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Note 22 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 28 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Business Segment Information Fiscal year ended March 31 2009 2010 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue Consumer, Professional & Devices 4,357.7 3,518.1 −19.3 % Networked Products & Services 1,755.6 1,572.6 −10.4 Pictures 717.5 705.2 −1.7 Music 387.1 522.6 +35.0 Financial Services 538.2 851.4 +58.2 All Other 530.1 460.8 −13.1 Corporate and Elimination (556.3 ) (416.8 )  Consolidated 7,730.0 7,214.0 −6.7 Fiscal year ended March 31 2009 2010 Percent change (Yen in billions) Operating income (loss) Consumer, Professional & Devices (115.6 ) (53.2 )  % Networked Products & Services (87.4 ) (83.3 )  Pictures 29.9 42.8 +43.1 Music 27.8 36.5 +31.1 Financial Services (31.2 ) 162.5  Equity in net loss of Sony Ericsson (30.3 ) (34.5 )  All Other 3.1 (5.0 )  Sub-Total (203.5 ) 65.9  Corporate and Elimination (24.2 ) (34.1 )  Consolidated (227.8 ) 31.8  51 Table of Contents Consumer, Professional & Devices Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased 19.3 percent year-on-year, to 3,518.1 billion yen. Sales to outside customers decreased 18.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. This decrease was primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, a decrease in sales of LCD televisions due to a decline in unit selling prices and a decrease in sales of home-use video cameras and compact digital cameras due to the contraction of these markets. An operating loss of 53.2 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 62.4 billion yen year-on-year. This was driven by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, and an improvement in the cost of sales ratio, mainly of LCD televisions, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit due to lower sales and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Restructuring charges were 75.9 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, which includes 7.3 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, compared with 53.7 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the previous fiscal year. Depreciation associated with restructured assets refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, a 27.1 billion yen non-cash charge related to the impairment of LCD television assets, which was not included in restructuring charges, was also recorded. (Refer to Note 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.) Products contributing to the improvement in operating results (excluding restructuring charges) include LCD televisions and compact digital cameras, reflecting the benefits of cost reduction activities that exceeded the impact of the decrease in sales, and images sensors, that saw an increase in sales. This was partially offset by lower operating results for the content creation systems which were affected by the deterioration in the business environment brought on by the slowing global economy and for system LSIs for the game business which were affected by lower sales resulting from price reductions driven by cost saving efforts. No additional provision or reversal of expenses relating to voluntary notebook computer battery pack recalls and the subsequent global replacement program, and free repair expenses relating to Sony products and the products of other companies containing Sony-made charged coupled devices was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, and the remaining balance of the provision as of March 31, 2010 was not significant.

Sales in the game business decreased year-on-year mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, decreases in unit sales of PSP®(PlayStation®Portable) (PSP) hardware and PlayStation®2 (PS2) software. These decreases were partially offset by increased unit sales of PS3 software, driven by the expanded PS3 platform as a result of the launch of a new model. An operating loss of 83.3 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 4.2 billion yen year-on-year. This was driven by an improvement in the cost of sales ratio, mainly of PS3 hardware, and a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in gross profit due to lower sales. Products contributing to the improvement in operating results (excluding restructuring charges) include flash memory digital audio players. On the other hand, operating results in the game business deteriorated mainly due to lower unit sales of PS2 software and of PSP hardware, partially offset by cost reductions in PS3 hardware and increased unit sales of PS3 software.

Sales to Outside Customers by Geographic Area Regarding sales to outside customers by geographic area for the CPD and NPS segments, combined sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 6 percent in Japan, 18 percent in the U.S., 25 percent in Europe, 8 percent in non-Japan Asia-Pacific*, and 15 percent in Other Areas. Total combined sales decreased year-on-year by 16 percent. * Major areas in Asia-Pacific are China, Taiwan, India, South Korea and Oceania. In Japan, sales of products such as LCD televisions and digital music players increased while sales in the game business and sales of products such as system LSI, storage media, chemical products*, broadcast- and professional-use products, and compact digital cameras decreased. In the U.S., sales of products such as digital book readers increased while sales of LCD televisions, sales in the game business and sales of products such as PCs, storage media, home-use video cameras, and compact digital cameras decreased. In Europe, sales of LCD televisions, sales in the game business and sales of products such as home-use video cameras, PCs, compact digital cameras, storage media, and broadcast- and professional-use products decreased. In Asia-Pacific, sales of products such as PCs increased while sales in the game business and sales of products such as LCD televisions, compact digital cameras, optical pickups, storage media, and home-use video cameras decreased. In Other Areas, sales of products such as LCD televisions, home audio, compact digital cameras, car audio, home-use video cameras, and storage media decreased. * Chemical products include materials and components for electronic devices such as circuit boards and adhesives. 54 Table of Contents Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 65 percent of the CPD and NPS segments combined total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was in-house production and approximately 35 percent was outsourced production. Approximately 50 percent of the annual in-house production took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, home-use video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and storage media. Approximately 60 percent of the annual in-house production in Japan was destined for other countries. Production in Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 15 percent of the annual in-house production, with approximately 55 percent destined for Japan, the Americas, Europe and China. Production in China accounted for approximately 15 percent of the annual in-house production, approximately 55 percent of which was destined for other countries. Production in the Americas and Europe together accounted for approximately 20 percent of the annual in-house production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Pictures Pictures segment results presented below are a yen-translation of the results of SPE, a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased 1.7 percent year-on-year, to 705.2 billion yen primarily due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 increased by approximately 7 percent. Motion picture revenues, also on a U.S. dollar basis, increased by approximately 5 percent year-on-year, primarily due to higher worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues from the current fiscal years film slate which included strong performances from 2012, Angels & Demons and Michael Jacksons This Is It. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment revenues from the previous fiscal years films. Television revenues, on a U.S. dollar basis, increased by approximately 9 percent year-on-year, primarily due to higher advertising revenues from several international channels, including a significant increase in India from the broadcasting of the Indian Premier League cricket competition. Operating income increased by 12.9 billion yen year-on-year, to 42.8 billion yen. Operating income increased by approximately 53 percent on a U.S. dollar basis. This increase was primarily from the sale of a portion of SPEs equity interest in a Latin American premium pay television business (HBO Latin America) and a U.S. cable network (Game Show Network), as well as the sale of all of its equity interest in a Central European premium pay television business (HBO Central Europe). The total gain recognized from these sales was 30.3 billion yen. The benefit from these gains was partially offset by the decrease in home entertainment revenues noted above and the write-off of certain development costs. As of March 31, 2010, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future, having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Music Music segment results presented below include the yen-translated results of SME, a U.S.-based operation which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis, the results of SMEJ, a Japan-based music company which aggregates its results in yen, and the yen-translated consolidated results of Sony/ATV, a 50 percent owned U.S.-based consolidated joint venture in the music publishing business which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 increased 35.0 percent year-on-year, to 522.6 billion yen. The increase was mainly due to the fact that results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 included the full year results of SME, which was consolidated as a wholly owned subsidiary beginning October 1, 2008 upon Sonys acquisition of Bertelsmann AGs 50 percent interest. On a pro forma basis, had SME been fully consolidated for the previous 55 Table of Contents fiscal year, sales in the Music segment for the previous fiscal year would have been 549.1 billion yen. Compared with these pro forma sales, Music segment sales decreased 5 percent year-on-year, primarily due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. On a U.S. dollar basis, when comparing the full year results for SME to the full year results for the previous fiscal year on a pro forma basis, sales for SME increased by 2 percent. The increase in sales primarily reflects the favorable impact of new releases and strong sales of Michael Jackson catalog product, partially offset by the continued decline of the physical music market. In addition to Michael Jacksons catalog albums, best-selling new releases during the fiscal year included Susan Boyles I Dreamed a Dream, the Michael Jacksons This Is It soundtrack, Alicia Keys The Element of Freedom and Glee the Music Vol.1 & 2, music collections from the hit U.S. television show, Glee. Sales at SMEJ included contributions from Michael Jacksons catalog albums and ikimono-gakaris HAJIMARI NO UTA. Operating income increased by 8.7 billion yen year-on-year, to 36.5 billion yen. Operating income for the previous fiscal year included equity in net loss of 6.0 billion yen for SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG) through October 1, 2008. On a pro forma basis, had SME been fully consolidated for the previous fiscal year, operating income for the Music segment would have been 21.3 billion yen. Compared to this pro forma operating income, Music segment operating income increased 72 percent year-on-year. The increase in the pro-forma segment results is primarily due to improved results from SME and SMEJ. On a U.S. dollar basis, when comparing the full year results for SME to the full year results for the previous fiscal year on a pro forma basis, operating income for SME increased by 487 percent, primarily due to the contribution from hit releases, Michael Jackson catalog product sales, growth in new music related businesses as well as a year-on-year decrease in overhead and restructuring costs. SMEJs contribution to operating income increased mainly due to the contribution from hit releases as well as year-on-year decreases in advertisement expenses and restructuring charges. Financial Services The results of Sony Life discussed below on the basis of U.S. GAAP differ from the results that SFH and Sony Life disclose separately on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 increased 58.2 percent year-on-year to 851.4 billion yen mainly due to an increase in revenue at Sony Life. Revenue at Sony Life was 740.4 billion yen, a 309.9 billion yen or 72.0 percent increase year-on-year. Revenue increased significantly year-on-year mainly due to an improvement in net gains from investments in the separate account, an improvement in net valuation gains from investments in convertible bonds in the general account and a significant decrease in impairment losses on equity securities in the general account, all as a result of the significant rise in the Japanese stock market in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, as compared with a significant decline following the global financial crisis in the previous fiscal year. Revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life increased, reflecting a steady increase in policy amount in force. Operating income of 162.5 billion yen was recorded, compared to an operating loss of 31.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year mainly as a result of a significant improvement in operating results at Sony Life. Operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 at Sony Life was 166.6 billion yen, as compared to an operating loss of 29.8 billion in the previous fiscal year, mainly due to the improvement in net valuation gains from investments in convertible bonds in the general account, a decrease in the provision of policy reserves because of the revision of the future investment yield of variable life insurance products in the separate account and the significant decrease in impairment losses on equity securities in the general account, all as a result of the improved situation in the Japanese stock market mentioned above. 56 Table of Contents Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment The following charts show Sonys information of operations for the Financial Services segment alone and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and Sony without the Financial Services segment, including noncontrolling interests, are included in those respective presentations, and then eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Sony Ericsson aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a euro basis. However, Sony believes that the following disclosure provides additional useful analytical information to investors regarding Sonys operating performance. Pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Sony Ericssons financial statements are included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F on pages A-1 to A-28 . Sales for the year ended March 31, 2010 decreased 37.2 percent year-on-year, to 6,457 million euro, mainly driven by significantly lower unit shipments as a result of continued challenging market conditions in all regions. A total of 53.0 million units were shipped for the year ended March 31, 2010, compared to 88.8 million units for the previous fiscal year. Despite the significantly lower sales, the loss before taxes increased only slightly by 21 million euro year-on-year to 654 million euro, primarily due to a reduction in research and development expenses as well as selling and administrative expenses. As a result, Sony recorded equity in the net loss of Sony Ericsson of 34.5 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, compared to a loss of 30.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. All Other Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased 13.1 percent year-on-year, to 460.8 billion yen. The decrease in sales was mainly due to a significant decrease in sales at a mobile phone OEM business in Japan and a decrease in sales at a measuring systems business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales at So-net Entertainment Corporation (So-net). An operating loss of 5.0 billion yen was recorded compared to an income of 3.1 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. This deterioration was mainly due to charges related to the withdrawal from the property management operation of an entertainment complex in Japan and the termination payments of the property lease contract. Restructuring As the global economy experienced a sharp downturn following the autumn of 2008, the operating environment for Sony became severe, with decreased demand, intensified pressure on pricing, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In an attempt to cope with this environment, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony continued to implement restructuring initiatives to reform its operational structure with a priority on profitability and speed. 58 Table of Contents In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 124.3 billion yen, which included 7.9 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, compared to 75.4 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the previous fiscal year. There were no non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets in the previous fiscal year. Of the total 124.3 billion yen incurred in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, 65.1 billion yen were personnel related costs, included in SGA expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, Sony either consolidated or sold five manufacturing sites in Japan and five manufacturing sites outside of Japan during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Restructuring charges were recorded mainly in the CPD segment, and All Other and Corporate. In the CPD segment, restructuring charges amounted to 75.9 billion yen, which includes 7.3 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, compared to 53.7 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the previous fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, restructuring activities included headcount reduction programs, initiatives to advance the rationalization of manufacturing operations, shifting and consolidating manufacturing to lower-cost countries and utilizing the services of OEMs and third party ODMs. In the CPD segment, most of the 39.8 billion yen of restructuring charges incurred within SGA expenses were personnel related costs. With respect to television operations, Sony ceased manufacturing operations at its Sony EMCS Corporation Ichinomiya TEC in June 2009, and at Sony Baja California, S.A. de C.V.s Mexicali factory in September, 2009. In January 2010, Sony completed the sale to the Hon Hai Group of 90.0 percent of Sonys equity interest in Sony Baja California and certain manufacturing assets related to LCD televisions at Sony Baja Californias Tijuana Factory in Mexico, which mainly manufactures LCD televisions for the Americas region. The Tijuana Factory remains a key manufacturing facility of Sony LCD televisions for the Americas region. In all segments, excluding the CPD segment, and All Other and Corporate, restructuring charges were recorded mainly due to headcount reductions through early retirement programs. Restructuring charges discussed in Item 5, which include non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, are described in Note 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the average rates of the yen were 91.8 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 129.7 yen against the euro, which were 8.4 percent and 9.5 percent higher, respectively, year-on-year. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations largely because the currency used in the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated or anticipated by Sony Corporation and by its subsidiaries transactions and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. SGTS in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges most of the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third party financial institutions. Most of these transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment. In the Financial Services segment, Sony uses derivatives for ALM and trading. 59 Table of Contents To minimize the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the CPD and NPS segments, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in other income and expenses. The notional amount and the net fair value of all the foreign exchange derivative contracts as of March 31, 2010 were 2,026.4 billion yen and a liability of 13.2 billion yen, respectively. Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Assets Total assets as of March 31, 2011 increased by 58.9 billion yen, or 0.5 percent year-on-year, to 12,925.0 billion yen. Total assets as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 457.6 billion yen, or 7.0 percent year-on-year, to 6,065.2 billion yen. Total assets as of March 31, 2011 in the Financial Services segment increased by 485.3 billion yen, or 7.4 percent year-on-year, to 7,062.4 billion yen. Current Assets Current assets as of March 31, 2011 decreased by 288.8 billion yen, or 7.0 percent year-on-year, to 3,844.0 billion yen. Current assets as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 212.2 billion yen, or 6.8 percent, year-on-year to 2,907.1 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 137.5 billion yen, or 14.0 percent year-on-year, to 847.4 billion yen. This was primarily due to lower net cash inflow in operating activities as a result of a decrease of notes and accounts payable, trade and an increase of inventories, and to net cash outflow in financing activities as a result of repayment of debts in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Refer to Cash Flows below. Notes and accounts receivable, trade (net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns) as of March 31, 2011, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 145.4 billion yen, or 16.4 percent year-on-year, to 742.3 billion yen, mainly due to foreign exchange rates and sales of accounts receivables under a securitization program in the United States. Refer to Note 6 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Other current assets as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased 71.1 billion yen, or 5.7 percent year-on-year, to 1,314.4 billion yen, mainly due to an increase in inventories. Inventories as of March 31, 2011 increased by 58.6 billion yen, or 9.1 percent year-on-year, to 704.0 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to an increase in CPD segment inventory resulting from an expansion of the LCD television business. Sony considers the inventory level as of March 31, 2011 to have been slightly higher than appropriate. The inventory to cost of sales turnover ratio (based on the average of inventories at the end of each fiscal year and the previous fiscal year) was 1.68 months compared to 1.79 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. Current assets as of March 31, 2011 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 91.6 billion yen, or 8.7 percent year-on-year, to 956.7 billion yen primarily due to the decrease of credit card and credit receivables resulting from the sale of a portion of the credit card business at Sony Financial International Inc. (SFI). Investments and Advances Investments and advances as of March 31, 2011 increased by 593.3 billion yen, or 11.2 percent year-on-year, to 5,892.7 billion yen. 60 Table of Contents Investments and advances as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 31.0 billion yen, or 8.2 percent year-on-year, to 345.7 billion yen primarily due to impairment and valuation losses from securities and investments, and the collection of advances. Investments and advances as of March 31, 2011 in the Financial Services segment increased by 613.3 billion yen, or 12.3 percent year-on-year, to 5,580.4 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to business growth at both Sony Life and Sony Bank, resulting in increases in investments made by Sony Life mainly in Japanese fixed income securities, and increases in mortgage loans provided by Sony Bank. Refer to Investments below. Property, Plant and Equipment (after deduction of accumulated depreciation) Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2011 decreased by 83.1 billion yen, or 8.2 percent year-on-year, to 924.9 billion yen. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 78.4 billion yen, or 8.1 percent year-on-year, to 894.8 billion yen. Factors contributing to the decrease in property, plant and equipment included the sale or disposal of assets due to the sale of certain factories and impairment charges recorded for related assets. The disposal or impairment of fixed assets damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake was 7.7 billion yen. Capital expenditures (additions to property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 increased by 12.1 billion yen, or 6.3 percent year-on-year, to 204.9 billion yen. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2011 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 4.7 billion yen, or 13.5 percent year-on-year, to 30.0 billion yen mainly due to the sale of the lease business at SFI. Other Assets Other assets as of March 31, 2011 decreased by 127.8 billion yen, or 6.0 percent year-on-year, to 1,988.0 billion yen primarily due to a decrease in deferred tax assets. Liabilities Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2011 increased by 388.5 billion yen, or 4.1 percent year-on-year, to 9,969.1 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 79.4 billion yen, or 2.1 percent year-on-year, to 3,723.7 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities in the Financial Services segment as of March 31, 2011 increased by 438.7 billion yen, or 7.4 percent year-on-year, to 6,333.2 billion yen. Current Liabilities Current liabilities as of March 31, 2011 increased by 67.1 billion yen, or 1.7 percent year-on-year, to 4,127.0 billion yen. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 61.5 billion yen, or 2.6 percent year-on-year, to 2,265.0 billion yen. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 78.0 billion yen, or 33.8 percent year-on-year, to 152.7 billion yen primarily due to the redemption of a 104.9 billion yen tranche of straight bonds. This decrease was partially offset by a transfer to current liabilities from long-term liabilities of the current portion of straight bonds that will mature during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. Notes and accounts payable, trade as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 12.8 billion yen, or 1.6 percent year-on-year, to 791.6 billion yen primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2011 in the Financial Services segment increased by 108.0 billion yen, or 6.1 percent year-on-year, to 1,881.8 billion yen mainly due to an increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank. 61 Table of Contents Long-term Liabilities Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2011 increased by 321.5 billion yen, or 5.8 percent year-on-year, to 5,842.1 billion yen. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 17.9 billion yen, or 1.2 percent year-on-year, to 1,458.7 billion yen. Long-term debt as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 94.0 billion yen, or 10.5 percent year-on-year, to 799.4 billion yen. This was primarily due to the above-mentioned transfer of the current portion of straight bonds to current liabilities. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2011 in the Financial Services segment increased by 330.7 billion yen, or 8.0 percent year-on-year, to 4,451.3 billion yen. This was primarily due to an increase in the policy amount in force at Sony Life. Total Interest-bearing Debt Total interest-bearing debt inclusive of long-term debt and short-term borrowings as of March 31, 2011 decreased by 233.2 billion yen, or 19.3 percent year-on-year, to 975.6 billion yen. Total interest-bearing debt as of March 31, 2011 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 172.0 billion yen, or 15.3 percent year-on-year, to 952.1 billion yen. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest In March 2011, Sony acquired an additional 5 percent equity interest in GSN, resulting in Sony owning a 40 percent equity interest. As part of the acquisition, Sony obtained a controlling interest in GSN and as a result, consolidated GSN. Sony granted a put right to the other investor in GSN for an additional 18 percent interest in GSN. The put right is exercisable during three windows starting on April 1 of each of 2012, 2013 and 2014 and lasting for 60 business days. The exercise price of the put is calculated using a formula based on an agreed upon multiple of the earnings of GSN with a minimum price of 234 million U.S. dollars and a maximum price of 288 million U.S. dollars. The portion of the noncontrolling interest that can be put to Sony is accounted for as mandatorily redeemable securities because redemption is outside of Sonys control and is reported in the mezzanine equity section in the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2011. Refer to Notes 24 and 27 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Sony Corporations Stockholders Equity Sony Corporations stockholders equity as of March 31, 2011 decreased by 417.9 billion yen, or 14.1 percent year-on-year, to 2,548.0 billion yen. Retained earnings decreased by 284.7 billion yen, or 15.4 percent year-on-year, to 1,566.3 billion yen as a result of the recording of 259.6 billion yen in net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders. Accumulated other comprehensive income deteriorated by 135.1 billion yen, or 20.2 percent year-on-year, to a loss of 804.2 billion yen primarily due to the recording of 118.4 billion yen of foreign currency translation adjustments. The ratio of Sony Corporations stockholders equity to total assets decreased 3.3 percentage points year-on-year, from 23.1 percent to 19.7 percent. Information of Financial Position Separating Out the Financial Services Segment The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of financial position for the Financial Services segment alone, and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and Sony without the Financial Services segment, including noncontrolling interests, are included in those respective presentations, and then eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. 62 Table of Contents Financial Services segment March 31 2010 2011 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 206,742 167,009 Marketable securities 576,129 643,171 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 10,099 5,933 Other 255,366 140,633 1,048,336 956,746 Investments and advances 4,967,125 5,580,418 Property, plant and equipment 34,725 30,034 Other assets: Deferred insurance acquisition costs 418,525 428,262 Other 108,421 66,944 526,946 495,206 6,577,132 7,062,404 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 86,102 23,191 Notes and accounts payable, trade 13,709 1,705 Deposits from customers in the banking business 1,509,488 1,647,752 Other 164,545 209,168 1,773,844 1,881,816 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 42,536 16,936 Accrued pension and severance costs 12,144 13,925 Future insurance policy benefits and other 3,876,292 4,225,373 Other 189,681 195,115 4,120,653 4,451,349 Stockholders equity of Financial Services 681,500 727,955 Noncontrolling interests 1,135 1,284 6,577,132 7,062,404 63 Table of Contents Sony without the Financial Services segment March 31 2010 2011 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 984,866 847,403 Marketable securities 3,364 3,000 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 887,694 742,297 Other 1,243,345 1,314,419 3,119,269 2,907,119 Film costs 310,065 275,389 Investments and advances 376,669 345,660 Investments in Financial Services, at cost 116,843 115,806 Property, plant and equipment 973,226 894,834 Other assets 1,626,764 1,526,389 6,522,836 6,065,197 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 230,631 152,664 Notes and accounts payable, trade 804,336 791,570 Other 1,291,481 1,320,741 2,326,448 2,264,975 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 893,418 799,389 Accrued pension and severance costs 283,382 257,395 Other 299,808 401,938 1,476,608 1,458,722 Redeemable noncontrolling interest  19,323 Stockholders equity of Sony without Financial Services 2,662,712 2,217,106 Noncontrolling interests 57,068 105,071 6,522,836 6,065,197 64 Table of Contents Consolidated March 31 2010 2011 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 1,191,608 1,014,412 Marketable securities 579,493 646,171 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 891,625 743,690 Other 1,470,146 1,439,773 4,132,872 3,844,046 Film costs 310,065 275,389 Investments and advances 5,299,393 5,892,655 Property, plant and equipment 1,007,951 924,868 Other assets: Deferred insurance acquisition costs 418,525 428,262 Other 1,697,308 1,559,768 2,115,833 1,988,030 12,866,114 12,924,988 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 284,607 163,351 Notes and accounts payable, trade 817,118 793,275 Deposits from customers in the banking business 1,509,488 1,647,752 Other 1,448,712 1,522,601 4,059,925 4,126,979 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 924,207 812,235 Accrued pension and severance costs 295,526 271,320 Future insurance policy benefits and other 3,876,292 4,225,373 Other 424,609 533,179 5,520,634 5,842,107 Redeemable noncontrolling interest  19,323 Sony Corporations stockholders equity 2,965,905 2,547,987 Noncontrolling interests 319,650 388,592 12,866,114 12,924,988 65 Table of Contents Investments The following table contains available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, including the breakdown of unrealized gains and losses by investment category.

Of the unrealized loss, no security was in an unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months at March 31, 2011. Sony Life principally invests in debt securities in various industries. Almost all of the debt securities in which Sony Life invested were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) or other rating agencies. At March 31, 2011, Sony Bank had debt securities which had gross unrealized losses of 13.6 billion yen. Of the unrealized loss, approximately 43.5 percent related to securities in an unrealized loss position for periods greater than 12 months at March 31, 2011. Sony Bank principally invests in Japanese government bonds, Japanese corporate bonds and foreign bonds. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by S&P, Moodys or other rating agencies. These unrealized losses related to numerous investments, with no single investment being in a material unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. In addition, there was no individual security with unrealized losses that met the test for impairment as the declines in value were observed to be small both in amounts and percentage, and therefore, the decline in value for those investments was still determined to be temporary in nature. 66 Table of Contents For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Life as of March 31, 2011 (51.3 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year:   1 to 5 years: 0.1 percent  5 to 10 years: 0.1 percent  above 10 years: 99.8 percent For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Bank as of March 31, 2011 (13.6 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 41.2 percent  1 to 5 years: 43.8 percent  5 to 10 years: 14.7 percent  above 10 years: 0.3 percent In the ordinary course of business, Sony maintains long-term investment securities, included in securities investments and other issued by a number of non-public companies. The aggregate carrying amount of the investments in non-public companies at March 31, 2011 was 67.4 billion yen. A non-public equity investment is primarily valued at cost if fair value is not readily determinable. If the value is estimated to have declined and such decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, the impairment of the investment is recognized immediately and the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, total realized impairment losses were 45.6 billion yen, 5.5 billion yen and 9.8 billion yen, respectively, of which 41.2 billion yen, 2.6 billion yen and 2.1 billion yen, respectively, were recorded in financial services revenue by the subsidiaries in the Financial Services segment. Realized impairment losses recorded other than by subsidiaries in the Financial Services segment in each of the three fiscal years were reflected in non-operating expenses and primarily relate to certain strategic investments in non-financial services businesses. These investments primarily relate to certain strategic investments in Japan and the U.S. with which Sony has strategic relationships for the purposes of developing and marketing new technologies. Impairment losses were recorded for each of the three fiscal years as certain companies failed to successfully develop and market such technology, resulting in the operating performance of these companies being more unfavorable than previously expected. As a result the decline in the fair value of these companies was judged as other-than-temporary. None of these impairment losses were individually material to Sony. Upon determination that the value of an investment is impaired, the value of the investment is written down to its fair value. For an investment where the quoted price is available in an active market, fair value is determined based on unadjusted quoted prices as of the date on which the impairment determination is made. For investments where the quoted price is not available in an active market, fair value is usually determined based on quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or measured through the use of various methodologies such as pricing models, discounted cash flow techniques, or similar techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investments. The impairment losses that were recorded in each of the three fiscal years related to the unique facts and circumstances of each individual investment and did not significantly impact other investments. Sony Life and Sony Banks investments constitute the majority of the investments in the Financial Services segment. Sony Life and Sony Bank account for approximately 79 percent and 19 percent of the investments in the Financial Services segment, respectively. 67 Table of Contents Contractual obligations, commitments, and contingent liabilities The following table summarizes Sonys contractual obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2011. The references to the notes below refer to the corresponding notes within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than Total 1 year years years 5 years (Yen in millions) Contractual obligations and commitments: Short-term debt (Note 11) 53,737 53,737    Long-term debt (Notes 8 and 11) Capital lease obligations 24,673 4,162 5,068 3,463 11,980 Other long-term debt 897,176 105,452 390,008 284,567 117,149 Interest on other long-term debt 37,551 10,685 15,127 7,261 4,478 Minimum rental payments required under operating leases (Note 8) 177,990 39,817 56,111 30,823 51,239 Purchase commitments (Note 27) Purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment 103,465 103,465    Expected cost for the production or purchase of motion pictures and television programming or certain rights 111,112 36,747 35,880 28,372 10,113 Long-term contracts with recording artists and companies 38,354 14,145 15,204 6,801 2,204 Other purchase commitments 97,084 53,625 30,717 10,238 2,504 Future insurance policy benefits and other in the life insurance business* (Note 10) 11,907,755 319,151 692,062 735,917 10,160,625 Gross unrecognized tax benefits** (Note 21) 225,120 10    Total 13,674,017 740,996 1,240,177 1,107,442 10,360,292 * Future insurance policy benefits and other in the life insurance business are the estimated future cash payments to be made to policy holders and others for future policy benefits, policyholders account balances, policyholders dividends, separate account liabilities and others. These cash payments are based upon assumptions including morbidity, mortality, withdrawals and other factors. Amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted. The sum of the cash payments of 11,907.8 billion yen exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of 4,204.1 billion yen included in the consolidated financial statements principally due to the time value of money (Note 10). ** The total amounts represent the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions. Sony estimates 10 million yen of the liability is expected to be settled within one year. The settlement period for the remaining portion of the liability, which totaled 225.1 billion yen, cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty associated with the timing of the settlements with the various taxing authorities (Note 21). 68 Table of Contents The following items are not included in either the above table or the total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2011:  The total amount of expected future pension payments is not included as such amount is not currently determinable. Sony expects to contribute approximately 35 billion yen to Japanese pension plans and approximately 11 billion yen to foreign pension plans during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 (Note 15).  The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under loan agreements in the Financial Services segment is not included as it is not foreseeable what loans will be incurred under such line of credit. The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under these contracts was 18.4 billion yen as of March 31, 2011 (Note 27).  Purchases are made during the ordinary course of business from certain component manufacturers and contract manufacturers in order to establish the best pricing and continuity of supply for Sonys production and are not included in the above table as there are typically no binding purchase obligations. Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Sony. These obligations specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be cancelled without penalty. Sony enters into arrangements with certain component manufacturers whereby Sony procures goods and services, including product components, for these component manufacturers and is reimbursed for the related purchases. Sonys supply chain management allows for flexible and mutually beneficial purchase arrangements with these manufacturers in order to minimize inventory risk. Consistent with industry practice, Sony purchases processed goods that meet technical criteria from these component manufacturers after issuing to these manufacturers information on Sonys projected demand and manufacturing needs. Further, in connection with the sale of its LCD television manufacturing operations in Mexico during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, and in the sale or transfer of LCD television manufacturing operations in Slovakia and Spain in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony entered into agreements to purchase certain LCD televisions in the future from the contract manufacturers that acquired the operations. The initial terms of the agreements were one year in Mexico and Slovakia and two years in Spain, with renewal options for the same time periods. In these agreements, Sony agreed to purchase a specified share of the LCD televisions that Sony sells in certain markets, including the U.S. and European markets. However, there are no binding purchase obligations as the specified share and pricing terms only apply to Sonys actual sales. In order to fulfill its commitments, Sony will use existing cash, cash generated by its operating activities, and intra-group borrowings, where possible. Further, Sony may raise funds through bonds, CP programs and committed lines of credit from banks, when necessary. The following table summarizes Sonys contingent liabilities and redeemable noncontrolling interest as of March 31, 2011. Total Amounts Contingent liabilities: (Note 27) (Yen in millions ) Loan guarantees to a creditor of the third party investor 25,194 Guarantees for a portion of Sony Ericssons debt 26,516 Other 51,903 Total contingent liabilities 103,613 Redeemable noncontrolling interest: (Note 27) (Yen in millions ) Redeemable noncontrolling interest 19,323 69 Table of Contents Off-balance sheet arrangements Sony has certain off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources and/or credit risk support. The below transactions are accounted for as sales in accordance with the accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. In each case, losses from these transactions were insignificant, and although Sony continues servicing the receivables subsequent to being sold or contributed, no servicing liabilities are recorded as the costs of collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. In addition to the cash proceeds from the sales below, net cash flows related to these transactions, including servicing fees, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were insignificant. Sony has established several accounts receivable sales programs in Japan whereby Sony can sell up to 47.2 billion yen of eligible trade accounts receivable in the aggregate at any one time. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. Sony can sell receivables in which the agreed upon original due dates are no more than 190 days after the sales of receivables. Total trade accounts receivable sold during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were 130.8 billion yen, 109.3 billion yen and 136.2 billion yen, respectively. A subsidiary of the Financial Services segment has established several receivables sales programs whereby the subsidiary can sell up to 24.0 billion yen of eligible receivables in the aggregate at any one time. Through these programs, the subsidiary can sell receivables to special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. The subsidiary can sell receivables in which the agreed upon original due dates are no more than 180 days after the sales of receivables. Total receivables sold during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were 166.1 billion yen, 183.8 billion yen and 166.0 billion yen, respectively. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony established an accounts receivable sales program in the United States. Through this program, a bankruptcy-remote entity, which is consolidated by a U.S. subsidiary, can sell up to 450 million U.S. dollars of eligible trade accounts receivables in the aggregate at any one time to a commercial bank. Total trade accounts receivables sold during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 were 258.1 billion yen. Subsequent to its establishment, Sony amended this program. While the transactions continued to qualify as sales under the new accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets, the amended program requires that a portion of the sales proceeds be held back and deferred until collection of the related receivables by the purchaser. The portion of the sales proceeds held back and deferred is initially recorded at estimated fair value, is included in other current assets and is 32.8 billion yen at March 31, 2011. Sony includes collections on such receivables as cash flows within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows since the receivables are the result of operating activities and the associated interest rate risk is insignificant due to its short-term nature. Total trade receivables sold, deferred proceeds from those sales and collections of deferred proceeds during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 were 414.1 billion yen, 185.6 billion yen and 153.6 billion yen, respectively. The accounts receivable sales programs in Japan and in the Financial Services segment above involved qualifying special-purpose entities (QSPEs) under the accounting guidance effective prior to April 1, 2010 for transfers of financial assets. Since the QSPEs met certain criteria, they were not consolidated by Sony. From April 1, 2010, the entities that formerly met the criteria to be a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) are subject to the same consolidation accounting guidance as other variable interest entities (VIEs), which is discussed further below. Sony has, from time to time, entered into various arrangements with VIEs. These arrangements include facilities which provide for the leasing of certain property, several joint ventures in the recorded music business, the U.S. based music publishing business, the financing of film production and the outsourcing of manufacturing operations. In addition, Sony has entered into several accounts receivable sales programs that involve VIEs as described above. In several of the arrangements in which Sony holds significant variable interests, Sony is the 70 Table of Contents primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates these VIEs. Arrangements in which Sony holds significant variable interests in VIEs but Sony is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate are described as follows: In connection with the September 2010 refinancing of the debt obligations of the third party investor in the U.S. based music publishing business, Sony has issued a guarantee to a creditor of the third party investor in which Sony has agreed to repay the outstanding principal plus accrued interest up to a maximum of 303 million U.S. dollars to the creditor should the third party investor default on its obligation. The obligation of the third party investor is collateralized by its 50 percent interest in Sonys music publishing subsidiary. Should Sony have to make a payment under the terms of the guarantee, Sony would assume the creditors rights to the underlying collateral. The assets of the third party investor that are being used as collateral were placed in a separate trust which is also a VIE in which Sony has significant variable interests. Based on a qualitative assessment, it was determined that Sony is not the primary beneficiary as Sony does not have the power to direct the activities of the trust. The assets held by the trust consist solely of the third party investors 50 percent ownership interest in the music publishing subsidiary. At March 31, 2011, the fair value of the assets held by the trust exceeded 303 million U.S. dollars. Sonys subsidiary in the Pictures segment entered into a joint venture agreement with a VIE to acquire the international distribution rights, as defined, to 12 pictures. The subsidiary is required to distribute these pictures internationally, for contractually defined fees determined as percentages of gross receipts, and is responsible for all distribution and marketing expenses, which are recouped from such distribution fees, each as defined. The VIE was capitalized with total financing of 406 million U.S. dollars. Of this amount, 11 million U.S. dollars was contributed by the subsidiary, 95 million U.S. dollars was provided by unrelated third party investors and the remaining funding was provided through a 300 million U.S. dollar bank credit facility. Under the agreement, the subsidiarys 11 million U.S. dollars equity investment is the last equity to be repaid. Based on the factors above, it was previously determined that the subsidiary was the primary beneficiary as it was projected to absorb the majority of the losses or residual returns. As of March 31, 2009, the bank credit facility had been terminated and the third party investors have been repaid their 95 million U.S. dollar investment. On May 11, 2009, the subsidiary repurchased from the VIE the international distribution rights to the 12 pictures and the VIE received a participation interest in these films on identical financial terms to those described above. As a result of repurchasing the international distribution rights from the VIE, Sony determined that the subsidiary was no longer the primary beneficiary as it was not projected to absorb the majority of the losses or residual returns of the VIE. No gain or loss was recognized by the subsidiary on the deconsolidation of the VIE. As of March 31, 2011, the subsidiarys balance sheet includes 67 million yen of film costs related to the international distribution rights acquired from the VIE and 1,098 million yen of participation liabilities recorded within accounts payable, other and accrued expenses as well as other noncurrent liabilities due to the VIE. Sonys subsidiary in the Pictures segment entered into two separate production/co-financing agreements with VIEs to co-finance 19 films that were released over the 31 months ended July 31, 2008. The subsidiary received 565 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreements to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). Additionally, on January 19, 2007, the subsidiary entered into a third production/co-financing agreement with another VIE to co-finance a majority of the films to be submitted through March 2012. The subsidiary has received a commitment from the third VIE that it will fund up to 525 million U.S. dollars on a revolving basis to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). At March 31, 2011, 18 films of the subsidiary have been released and approximately 554 million U.S. dollars collectively have been funded by the third VIE. Under all three agreements, the subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIEs share in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. As the subsidiary did not have the power to direct the activities of these three VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIEs, the subsidiary does not absorb the majority of the losses or residual returns, and therefore does not qualify as the primary beneficiary for any of the VIEs. At March 31, 2011, there were no amounts recorded on the subsidiarys balance sheet that related to any of the VIEs other than the investors earned but unpaid share of the films net profits, as defined. In January 2010, Sony sold 90.0 percent of its interest in a Mexican subsidiary which primarily manufactured LCD televisions, as well as other assets including machinery and equipment of 4,520 million yen and inventories of 71 Table of Contents 5,619 million yen, to a contract manufacturer. The continuing entity, which would perform this manufacturing going forward, is a VIE as it is thinly capitalized and dependent on funding from the parent entity. Based on a qualitative assessment, it was determined that Sony is not the primary beneficiary as Sony does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, nor does Sony have the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE. In connection with the sale of Sonys controlling interest in the subsidiary, Sony received 11,189 million yen and recorded a loss of 1,664 million yen during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Concurrent with the sale, Sony entered into an agreement with the VIE and its parent company in which Sony agreed to purchase a significant share of the LCD televisions that Sony sells in certain markets, including the U.S. market. As of March 31, 2011, the amounts recorded on Sonys consolidated balance sheets that relate to the VIE include receivables recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets of 21,953 million yen and accounts payable, trade of 20,853 million yen. Sonys maximum exposure to losses is considered insignificant. As described above, accounts receivable sales programs in Japan and in the Financial Services segment also involve VIEs that formerly met the criteria to be a QSPE. These VIEs are all special purpose entities of the sponsor banks. In addition, a counterparty of the accounts receivable transactions in the U.S. includes a VIE. Based on a qualitative assessment, Sony is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate these entities as Sony does not have the power to direct the activities, an obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive the residual returns of these VIEs. Sonys maximum exposure to losses from these VIEs is considered insignificant. Refer to Note 23 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on VIEs. Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, there was a net cash inflow of 616.2 billion yen, a decrease of 296.7 billion yen, or 32.5 percent year-on-year. For all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a net cash inflow of 255.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, a decrease of 314.4 billion yen, or 55.1 percent year-on-year. This net cash inflow was mainly due to a cash contribution from net income after taking into account depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes as well as a decrease in notes and accounts receivable, trade. The inflow was partially offset by an increase in inventories. The year-on-year decrease in net cash inflow was mainly due to a decrease in notes and accounts payable, trade and an increase of inventories, partially offset by an improvement in net income (loss) after taking into account depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes and a decrease in notes and accounts receivable, trade. The Financial Services segment had a net cash inflow of 369.5 billion yen, an increase of 21.4 billion yen, or 6.2 percent year-on-year. This net cash inflow was generated primarily due to an increase in revenue from insurance premiums as a result of a steady increase in policy amount in force at Sony Life. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash inflow increased primarily due to an increase in cash contribution from net income after excluding the impact of gains or losses on the revaluation of marketable securities held for trading purposes as well as on the revaluation or impairment of securities investments. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony used 714.4 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 31.6 billion yen, or 4.2 percent year-on-year. For all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a use of 137.6 billion yen, a decrease of 110.3 billion yen, or 44.5 percent year-on-year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, net cash was used mainly for purchases of manufacturing equipment. The net cash used in investing activities decreased year-on-year primarily due to smaller purchases of manufacturing equipment. The Financial Services segment used 552.9 billion yen of net cash, an increase of 77.2 billion yen, or 16.2 percent year-on-year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, payments for investments and advances, carried out primarily at Sony Life and Sony Bank, where operations are expanding, exceeded proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. The net cash outflow during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was partially offset by proceeds from the deconsolidation of a lease and rental business at SFI. The net cash used within the Financial Services segment increased year-on- year primarily 72 Table of Contents due to a decrease in proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. In all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash generated by operating and investing activities combined* for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was 118.3 billion yen, a decrease of 204.0 billion yen, or 63.3 percent year-on-year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, 10.1 billion yen of net cash was used in financing activities, compared to 365.0 billion yen generated in the previous fiscal year. For all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, there was 186.9 billion yen of net cash outflow, compared to a net cash inflow of 98.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to significantly higher levels of both issuances of long-term corporate bonds and borrowings from banks in the previous fiscal year. There were no comparable issuances or borrowings during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011; in addition, there was a 104.9 billion yen redemption of domestic straight bonds and a 52.0 billion yen repayment of a syndicated loan during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. In the Financial Services segment, financing activities generated 143.7 billion yen of net cash, a decrease of 94.9 billion yen, or 39.8 percent year-on-year, primarily due to a smaller increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank and increased repayments of long-term debt. Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: Accounting for the above factors and the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2011 was 1,014.4 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents of all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, was 847.4 billion yen at March 31, 2011, a decrease of 137.5 billion yen, or 14.0 percent, compared with the balance as of March 31, 2010. Sony believes it continues to maintain sufficient liquidity through access to a total, translated into yen, of 755.2 billion yen of unused committed lines of credit with financial institutions in addition to the cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2011. Within the Financial Services segment, the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents was 167.0 billion yen at March 31, 2011, a decrease of 39.7 billion yen, or 19.2 percent, compared with the balance as of March 31, 2010. * Sony has included the information for cash flow from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities, as management frequently monitors this financial measure, and believes this non-U.S. GAAP measurement is important for use in evaluating Sonys ability to generate cash to maintain liquidity and fund debt principal and dividend payments from business activities other than its Financial Services segment. This information is derived from the reconciliations prepared in the section Information of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment. This information and the separate condensed presentations shown below are not required or prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Financial Services segments cash flow is excluded from the measure because SFH, which constitutes a majority of the Financial Services segment, is a separate publicly traded entity in Japan with a significant minority interest and it, as well as its subsidiaries, secure liquidity on their own. This measure may not be comparable to those of other companies. This measure has limitations, because it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures principally due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the principal payments required for debt service. Therefore, Sony believes it is important to view this measure as supplemental to its entire statement of cash flows and together with Sonys disclosures regarding investments, available credit facilities and overall liquidity. 73 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the differences between the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reported and cash flows from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities is as follows: Fiscal year ended March 31 2010 2011 (Yen in billions) Net cash provided by operating activities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows 912.9 616.2 Net cash used in investing activities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows (746.0 ) (714.4 ) 166.9 (98.2 ) Less: Net cash provided by operating activities within the Financial Services segment 348.0 369.5 Less: Net cash used in investing activities within the Financial Services segment (475.7 ) (552.9 ) Eliminations** 27.7 33.1 Cash flow from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities 322.3 118.3 ** Eliminations primarily consist of intersegment loans and dividend payments.

Information of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment The following charts show Sonys cash flow information for the Financial Services segment alone, and for all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and Sony without the Financial Services segment, including noncontrolling interests, are included in those respective presentations, and then eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a net cash inflow of 570.2 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 457.5 billion yen, or 406.0 percent year-on-year. The major cash inflow factors included a cash contribution from net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization (including amortization of film costs), an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade, and a decrease in inventories. This exceeded cash outflow, which included increases in film costs and in notes and accounts receivable, trade. Compared with the previous fiscal year, the net cash inflow increased mainly due to an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 compared to a decrease in the previous fiscal year and lower tax payments. This increase was partially offset by an increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 compared to a decrease in the previous fiscal year. The Financial Services segment had a net cash inflow of 348.0 billion yen, an increase of 47.9 billion yen, or 16.0 percent year-on-year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net cash inflow was generated primarily due to an increase in revenue from insurance premiums as a result of a steady increase in policy amount in force at Sony Life. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash inflow increased primarily reflecting the increase in revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony used 746.0 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 335.3 billion yen, or 31.0 percent year-on-year. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was 247.9 billion yen of net cash used, a decrease of 239.5 billion yen, or 49.1 percent year-on-year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net cash was used mainly for purchases of manufacturing equipment. The net cash used decreased year-on-year primarily as a result of lower investments in and purchases of manufacturing equipment, although the previous fiscal year benefited from proceeds generated mainly from the sale of semiconductor fabrication equipment. 75 Table of Contents The Financial Services segment used 475.7 billion yen of net cash, a decrease of 126.6 billion yen, or 21.0 percent year-on-year. Payments for investments and advances, carried out primarily at Sony Life and Sony Bank, where operations are expanding, exceeded proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. The net cash used within the Financial Services segment decreased year-on-year primarily due to a decrease in investments at Sony Bank. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash generated by operating and investing activities combined* for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was 322.3 billion yen, an improvement of 697.1 billion yen compared to net cash used in the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, 365.0 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities, an increase of 97.6 billion yen, or 36.5 percent year-on-year. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a 98.6 billion yen net cash inflow, an increase of 88.7 billion yen, or 891.7 percent year-on year. This was primarily due to issuances of long-term corporate bonds and borrowings from banks in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, which were partially offset by net repayments of short-term borrowings including commercial paper. In June 2009, Sony Corporation issued domestic straight bonds totaling 220 billion yen in Japan with maturities ranging from 3 to 10 years. In the Financial Services segment, financing activities generated 238.6 billion yen of net cash, a decrease of 21.7 billion yen, or 8.3 percent year-on-year, primarily due to a decrease in short-term borrowings, net for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 compared to an increase for the previous fiscal year. Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: Accounting for the above factors and the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2010 was 1,191.6 billion yen, an increase of 530.8 billion yen, or 80.3 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2009. The outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment was 984.9 billion yen, an increase of 419.9 billion yen, or 74.3 percent, compared with the balance as of March 31, 2009. Sony believes it continues to maintain sufficient liquidity through access to a total, translated into yen, of 788.5 billion yen of unused committed lines of credit with financial institutions in addition to the cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2010. Within the Financial Services segment, the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents was 206.7 billion yen, an increase of 110.9 billion yen, or 115.8 percent, compared with the balance as of March 31, 2009. * Sony has included the information for cash flow from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities, as management frequently monitors this financial measure, and believes this non-GAAP measurement is important for use in evaluating Sonys ability to generate cash to maintain liquidity and fund debt principal and dividend payments from business activities other than its Financial Services segment.

Furthermore, the Financial Services segment is described separately at the end of this section. Liquidity Management and Market Access An important financial objective of Sony is to maintain the strength of its balance sheet, while securing adequate liquidity for business activities. Sony defines its liquidity sources as the amount of cash and cash equivalents (cash balance) (excluding restrictions on capital transfers mainly due to national regulations) and the unused amount of committed lines of credit. Sonys basic liquidity management policy is to secure sufficient liquidity throughout the relevant fiscal year, covering such factors as 50 percent of monthly consolidated sales and repayments on debt that comes due within six months. Funding requirements that arise from maintaining liquidity are principally covered by cash flow from operating and investing activities combined and by the cash balance; however, as needed, Sony has demonstrated the ability to procure funds from financial and capital markets. In the event financial and capital markets became illiquid, based on its current forecasts, Sony could sustain sufficient liquidity through access to committed lines of credit with financial institutions, together with its cash balance. Sony procures funds mainly from the financial and capital markets through Sony Corporation and SGTS, a finance subsidiary in the U.K. In order to meet working capital requirements, Sony Corporation and SGTS maintain CP programs which have the ability to access the Japanese, the U.S. and European CP markets, subject to prevailing market conditions. Although the CP program limit amounts, translated into yen, were 1,082.1 billion yen in total for Sony Corporation 78 Table of Contents and SGTS as of March 31, 2011, there were no amounts outstanding under the CP programs as of and during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Sony typically raises funds through straight bonds, CP programs and bank loans (including syndicated loans); however, in the unlikely event Sony could not access liquidity from these sources, Sony can also draw on committed lines of credit from various financial institutions. Sony has a total, translated into yen, of 755.2 billion yen in committed lines of credit, none of which had been used as of March 31, 2011. Details of those committed lines of credit are: a 475 billion yen committed line of credit contracted with a syndicate of Japanese banks, effective until November 2013, a 1.5 billion U.S. dollar multi-currency committed line of credit also with a syndicate of Japanese banks, effective until December 2013, and a 1.87 billion U.S. dollar of multi-currency committed line of credit contracted with a syndicate of global banks, effective until April 2012, in all of which Sony Corporation and SGTS are defined as the borrowers. These contracts are aimed at securing sufficient liquidity in a quick and stable manner even in the event of financial and capital markets turmoil similar to that which occurred in the fall of 2008. In the event of a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings, even though the cost of some of those borrowings could increase, there are no financial covenants in any of Sonys material financial agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation or any impairment on the ability to drawdown on unused facilities. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the uses of most proceeds except that certain borrowings may not be used to acquire securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange or traded over-the-counter in the U.S. in accordance with the rules and regulations issued by authorities such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. Ratings Sony considers one of managements top priorities to be the maintenance of stable and appropriate credit ratings in order to ensure financial flexibility for liquidity and capital management and continued adequate access to sufficient funding resources in the financial and capital markets. In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Sony obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P). In addition, Sony maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital markets. Sonys current debt ratings from each agency as of June 24, 2011 are noted below: Moodys S&P R&I Long-term debt A3 (Outlook: stable) A- (Outlook: negative) AA- (Outlook: stable) Short-term debt P-2 A-2 a-1+ Cash Management Sony manages its global cash management activities mainly through SGTS. The excess or shortage of cash at most of Sonys subsidiaries is invested or funded by SGTS on a net basis, although Sony recognizes that fund transfers are limited in certain countries and geographic areas due to restrictions on capital transactions. In order to pursue more efficient cash management, cash surpluses among Sonys subsidiaries are deposited with SGTS and cash shortfalls among subsidiaries are covered by loans through SGTS, so that Sony can make use of excess cash balances and reduce third party borrowings. Financial Services segment The management of SFH, Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank recognizes the importance of securing sufficient liquidity to cover the payment of obligations that these companies incur in the ordinary course of business. Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank maintain a sufficient cash balance and secure sufficient means to meet their obligations while abiding by laws and regulations such as the Insurance Business Act or the Banking Act of Japan, and restrictions imposed by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) and other regulatory authorities as well as establishing and operating under company guidelines that comply with these regulations. Sony Life and Sony Assurance establish a sufficient level of liquidity for the smooth payment of insurance claims when they invest 79 Table of Contents primarily in various securities cash inflows which are mainly from policyholders insurance premiums. Sony Bank establish a necessary level of liquidity for the smooth settlement of transactions when it uses its cash inflows, which come mainly from customers deposits in local or foreign currencies, in order to offer mortgage loans to individuals or to make bond investments. SFH currently has an AA- rating from R&I for issuer rating. Sony Life currently has ratings from four rating agencies: AA- from S&P for insurer financial strength rating, Aa3 from Moodys for insurance financial strength rating, AA from R&I for ability to pay insurance claims and AA from the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. (JCR) for ability to pay insurance claims. Sony Bank obtained an A rating from S&P for its long-term counterparty credit rating, an A-1 rating from S&P for its short-term counterparty credit rating and an AA- rating from the JCR for long-term senior debt rating. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT It is necessary for Sony to continue technological innovation in order to maintain group-wide growth. Sony believes that technology made possible by our research and development activities is a key to the differentiation of products in existing businesses and the source of creating value in new businesses. Research and development is focused in four key domains: a common development platform technology for home and mobile electronics, and semiconductor, device, and software technologies, which are essential for product differentiation and for creating value-added products. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 decreased by 5.2 billion yen, or 1.2 percent year-on-year, to 426.8 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) decreased from 6.8 percent to 6.7 percent. Expenses in the CPD segment decreased 0.5 billion yen, or 0.2 percent year-on-year, to 291.3 billion yen and expenses in the NPS segment decreased 2.7 billion yen, or 2.8 percent year-on-year, to 93.0 billion yen.

TREND INFORMATION This section contains forward-looking statements about the possible future performance of Sony and should be read in light of the cautionary statement on that subject, which appears on the inside front cover page and applies to this entire document. Issues Facing Sony and Managements Response to those Issues The world economy in general appears to be continuing the gradual pace of recovery. While growth will likely remain low for developed countries due to fiscal restructuring, high unemployment rates and stagnant housing markets, the growth rate forecasts for emerging countries, with their growing demand, are higher than those 80 Table of Contents forecasts for developed countries. A scenario in which emerging countries will lead world economic growth is becoming increasingly evident. Faced with such circumstances, Sony has been actively working to achieve a strategic integration of hardware, content and network services over the past few years while establishing lateral platforms spanning production, logistics, procurement, customer services, global sales and marketing, R&D and common software design, achieving steady improvements in competitiveness and profitability. In addition, Sony has been working aggressively to increase its sales of products from high-end to entry class models in emerging markets where demand is increasing due to economic growth. These improvements have enabled Sony to achieve a significant increase in consolidated operating income, reaching 199.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, nearly 6.3 times that of the previous fiscal years amount, despite the substantial negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Sony also reorganized its core businesses of electronics and network services into two new groups as of April 1, 2011: the Consumer Products & Services (CPS) Group, which includes all of Sonys consumer electronics products and the network services that link them; and the Professional, Device & Solutions (PDS) Group, which includes semiconductors, professional solutions businesses such as broadcasting and professional equipment, as well as the core device business, and new business fields. In the CPS Group, Sony is aiming to step up the pace of next-generation, groundbreaking product development in both the home and mobile segments through the swift and flexible allocation of resources to the most important business areas of consumer electronics, games, and network services. In the PDS Group, Sony plans to contribute to vertically integrated product development based on cutting-edge Sony technologies as well as core devices and to provide customers with solutions incorporating these, while also breaking into new businesses in growth areas such as the energy business field. Through these structural reforms, Sony plans to accelerate its evolution and growth by making maximum use of its technological strengths as a corporation that provides appealing entertainment experiences and innovative solutions to customers worldwide. In November 2009, Sony announced its aim to achieve a medium-term target of a consolidated operating margin of 5 percent and a return on equity of 10 percent by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013. Since then, Sonys business situation has become increasingly uncertain, reflecting volatile foreign exchange rates and intensified price competition in the consumer electronics markets. Going forward, the situation is anticipated to become more challenging due to the impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in March 2011. Sony plans to respond to these challenging conditions, however, by pursuing the growth strategy mentioned above under the new management structure and based on the structural reforms accomplished up to this point. Production at ten manufacturing sites was suspended due to damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, though all of them had resumed or partially resumed production by May 30, 2011. The site with the largest damage, located in Tagajyo City, Miyagi Prefecture, resumed phased production of disc media, including Blu-ray Disc, and magnetic tapes on May 30, 2011. Manufacturing of other products and components previously carried out at that site is expected to be transferred to Sonys core manufacturing facilities for these products and components located in Miyagi, Fukushima and other prefectures, in order to quickly restore full production capacity. Certain domestic and overseas manufacturing sites not directly affected by the disaster have also temporarily reduced operating rates on some production lines to accommodate difficulties with the procurement of raw materials, parts and other supplies. Sony plans to continue to work for the rapid restoration of production of products for which production was affected, by reallocating inventory of raw materials and parts within the Sony group, using alternative materials or parts, and expanding sourcing for these, among other measures. During the spring of 2011, Sonys network services for PlayStation®Network, Qriocitytm and Sony Online Entertainment and the websites of certain subsidiaries have been subject to cyber-attacks. With respect to PlayStation®Network, Qriocitytm and Sony Online Entertainment, Sony shut down the services once a possibility of illegal and unauthorized access and undefined data transfer had been confirmed, and conducted an investigation to determine the scope of the intrusion and any theft, and then made public its understanding of the scope of the data breach. Sony has implemented new and additional security control measures, the mainstays of which were improving the surveillance function for monitoring new attacks, enhancing the detection function for illegal and 81 Table of Contents unauthorized access and suspicious activities and increasing levels of encryption and data protection, before restoring any services. Sony began the phased restoration of the services from May 15, 2011. In addition, Sony fully restored all PlayStation®Network services on June 2, 2011, in the Americas, Europe/PAL territories and Asia, excluding Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea, as well as resumed its Music Unlimited powered by Qriocitytm for certain products. The network strategy is one of Sonys most important strategies, and Sony will continue to contribute to the protection of personal information and the development of a secure and sound networked society, while further strengthening the information control structure for the entire Sony group. A description of issues recognized by Sony management for its main businesses and its efforts to address these are as follows: Sony strives to improve profitability in the television business with the various initiatives. To be specific, Sony plans to make further enhancements to business and operational structures achieved through reforms to the business structure and supply chain up to this point, and to steadily advance business strategies matched to the unique characteristics of respective geographical regions along with reducing costs even further. Sony aims to capture growth opportunities by expanding its line-up, from high-end models to the popularly priced range, to match the preferences of customers in emerging markets where product demand is more robust than mature markets. Sony simultaneously intends to pursue business with a focus on high value-added models in developed countries with sluggish market growth in the face of slow-growing economies, and to improve efficiency in sales operations including inventory management. With respect to LCD panel procurement, which could have a serious impact on the profitability of the television business, Sony aims to reduce the cost of panels at its joint ventures and also aims to ensure that Sony is able to procure panels more flexibly from non-joint venture sources in accordance with changes in market prices for panels in order to secure benefits from improvements in panel quality and lower panel costs achieved in the industry in general. In the digital imaging product industry, the market growth in advanced countries is slowing down and further competition is anticipated, but Sony is differentiating performance with lenses, image sensors, image processing engines and other key devices, enhancing product appeal by improving network capable functions, and making ongoing improvements in cost competitiveness. Sony aims to secure stable profitability for the entire product category as a whole by improving the profitability of interchangeable single lens camera products through targeting further expansion of market share and by expanding the product line-up in compact digital cameras for popularly priced products intended for emerging markets. In the game business, for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, Sony intends to achieve and maintain broader market penetration of hardware for PS3, which contributed to the overall profitability of the business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, while further expanding its game software titles and line-up for non-game content to improve profitability of PS3. Sony will also work steadily to launch new businesses, beginning with a market launch of the next generation portable entertainment system (PlayStation®Vita), and PlayStation®Suite, which will offer PlayStation content, among other things, on Android OS-equipped mobile devices. In the network-related business, Sony strives to achieve differentiation by providing new content and applications and by making these easier to use, and will work to establish competitive network services while also aiming for sales growth through further regional expansion of network services and the introduction of Sony Tablet and other products to work with these network services. During the spring of 2011, Sonys network services and the websites of certain subsidiaries have been subject to cyber-attacks. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the strategy of network services which Sony expects to continue to expand, based on the information currently available to Sony. In the semiconductor business, Sony plans to develop new products in the categories of image sensors and display devices to achieve future growth, and will continue to make investments during fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 in increasing production capacity for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, which were announced in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Sony strives to improve profitability over the medium to long term by capturing image sensor demand for smartphones, interchangeable single lens cameras and other products for which future growth is projected by expanding production capacity of CMOS image sensors. 82 Table of Contents Sonys goal in the professional solutions business is to expand sales by providing a broad range of products to the markets of emerging countries that are showing strong economic growth in addition to the markets in developed countries where signs of a rebound in demand can be seen. Sony strives to improve future profitability by strengthening the system solutions business and actively working to expand the line-up related to 3D and high resolution digital cinema, such as cameras and projectors. In the pictures business, Sony faces intense competition, rising expenses, including production, advertising and promotion expenses, a mature home entertainment market with a continuing industry-wide decline in physical DVD sales worldwide, increasingly limited access to third party financing, and digital theft. To meet these challenges, Sony is working to produce and acquire a diversified portfolio of motion picture and television product with broad worldwide appeal for distribution in all media and emerging platforms, including digital distribution. Sony also plans to explore alternative avenues for financing its motion picture and television product, take action to combat the unauthorized digital distribution of its copyrighted content and explore opportunities for the expansion of its worldwide television networks. The music business has been operating in a challenging market environment for several years, with the ongoing decline in physical sales not yet offset by the continued growth in the digital market. This trend is expected to continue in the medium term. The growing digital business holds significant potential with the launch of new initiatives and the introduction of innovative products in the digital marketplace. Against this market backdrop, Sony continues to invest in and develop new and existing artist talent, and is pursuing growing new business revenue streams such as live concerts, artist management, and sponsorships. In the financial services businesses, Sony must rapidly and adequately realize its growth strategy in a fiercely competitive environment and address the needs of a low birthrate and an aging population in Japan as well as the diversifying needs of its customers. In such a business environment, Sonys financial services businesses, which are latecomers to the life insurance, non-life insurance and banking industries, will make use of distinctive, individual industry-specific business models and pursue higher levels of customer satisfaction. The financial services businesses also plan to achieve further growth by enhancing synergies among the businesses, reinforcing their own positions in the business domains recently entered into, such as individual variable annuity insurance and securities brokerage, and entering into new business domains. Sony Life has been building an investment portfolio mainly comprised of ultralong-term bonds, in order to manage investment risks and ensure stable long-term returns. Based on this policy, Sony Life plans to continue its investment in ultralong-term bonds in the future. The balance of convertible bonds was eliminated by the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, as a result of efforts to reduce the balance of higher risk assets held such as stocks and convertible bonds in order to mitigate the impact of the risk of a decline in stock prices. Global Environmental Plan Road to Zero Sony announced its Road to Zero global environmental plan in April 2010. The plan includes a long-term vision of achieving a zero environmental footprint by 2050 through Sonys business operations and product lifecycles, in pursuit of a sustainable society. Sony aims to achieve this vision through continuous innovation and the utilization of offset mechanisms. The plan also draws a comprehensive roadmap based on the following four goals:  Climate change: Reduction of energy consumption in pursuit of zero greenhouse gas emissions.  Resource conservation: Reduction in the use of virgin materials of priority resources, by minimizing waste generation, appropriate water consumption, and continuous increase of waste recycling.  Control of chemical substances: Minimization of the risks that certain chemical substances pose to the environment through preventative measures, reduction in the use of specific chemicals defined by Sony, and promotion of the use of alternative materials.  Biodiversity: Conservation and recovery of biodiversity through Sonys own business operations and local social contribution programs. 83 Table of Contents Among the above goals, Sonys specific mid-term targets for climate change include the following:  Target an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (calculated in terms of CO2) of 30 percent by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, compared to the level of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001.  Target a reduction in power consumption per product of 30 percent by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, compared to the level of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Further details of the global environmental plan Road to Zero and actual measures undertaken by Sony are reported in Sonys CSR report available on the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/report/index.html CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Sony evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience, future projections and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Sony considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to its financial condition and results, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Sony believes that the following represents its critical accounting policies. Investments Sonys investments include debt and equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity method of accounting. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to income. Sony regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of the credit condition of the issuers, sovereign risk, and whether or not Sony is able to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities whose fair values are readily determinable, Sony presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally for a period of up to six months). This criterion is employed as a threshold to identify securities which may have a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. Sony adopted new accounting guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities on April 1, 2009. Under this guidance, when an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income depends on whether Sony intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. If the debt security meets either of these two criteria, the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in income, measured as the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost and its fair value at the impairment measurement date. For other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities that do not meet these two criteria, the net amount recognized in income is a credit loss equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and its net present value calculated by discounting Sonys best estimate of 84 Table of Contents projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment. Any difference between the fair value and the net present value of the debt security at the impairment measurement date is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized gains or losses on securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in income are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Before the adoption of this guidance, an other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income for debt securities was equal to the total difference between amortized cost and fair value at the impairment measurement date. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary is often subjective in nature and involves certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected operating results, business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that Sony currently believes to be temporary may be determined to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of subsequent information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in the value of worldwide equity markets and the effect of worldwide interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized and reduce income in future periods. Valuation of inventory Sony values its inventory based on the lower of cost or market. Sony writes down inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value  i.e., estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal. Sony writes down the value of its inventory when the underlying parts, components or products have become obsolete, when inventory levels exceed the amount expected to be used, or when the value of the inventory is otherwise recorded at a higher value than net realizable value. As a result, if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected and further price decreases are needed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in the future. Impairment of long-lived assets Sony reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. This review is primarily performed using estimates of future cash flows by product category (e.g. LCD televisions) or, in certain cases, by entity. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in Sonys businesses or assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of long-lived assets. The deterioration of the business climate and its continued financial impact on the CPD and NPS segments in the second half of calendar year 2008 and into early calendar year 2009 was considered a circumstance which indicated that the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups in those segments may not have been recoverable. As such, Sony tested the long-lived assets of the CPD and NPS segments, which consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment, by comparing carrying values of assets or asset groups with estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment charges as a result of the testing are included in the amounts described below. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 17,370 million yen which did not include any individually significant charges. These charges also partially related to restructuring activities, primarily in the CPD segment. The estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for the recoverability testing and discounted cash flows for determining fair value reflected Sonys revised business plans 85 Table of Contents and the deteriorated business climate, particularly the timing and rate of the future business recovery, and required significant judgment. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 53,304 million yen. These charges also partially related to restructuring activities undertaken, primarily in the CPD segment. Of the total impairment charges for long-lived assets recorded by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, 27,100 million yen related to the LCD televisions assets group within the CPD segment. The impairment charge primarily reflects a decrease in the estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, management updated its strategic plans, which resulted in decreases in the assets estimated service periods and corresponding estimated future cash flows leading to the impairment charge. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 23,735 million yen which did not include any individually significant charges. These charges included impairment losses of 7,668 million yen due to significant damage to certain fixed assets directly caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake. For further details, please refer to Note 18 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The charges also partially related to restructuring activities, primarily in the CPD and NPS segments. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and the assets are also tested between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying amount. Such an event would include unfavorable variances from established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, which are periodically reviewed by Sonys management. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Reporting units are Sonys operating segments or one level below the operating segments. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. In its impairment review, Sony performs internal valuation analyses or utilizes third party valuations when management believes it to be appropriate, and considers other market information that is publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values, determination of appropriate market 86 Table of Contents comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. In addition to the estimates of future cash flows, two of the most significant assumptions applied to estimated cash flows involved in the determination of fair value of the reporting units were the discount rates and the perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values used in the discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rates used in the cash flow models for the goodwill impairment testing considered market and industry data as well as specific risk factors for each reporting unit. The perpetual growth rates for the individual reporting units, for purposes of the terminal value determination, were generally set after an initial three-year forecasted period, although certain reporting units, including the Pictures reporting unit described below, utilized longer forecasted periods, and were based on historical experience, market and industry data. Except as described below, fair value exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units with goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life, and therefore no impairment existed and the second step of the impairment test was not required. As a result, no material impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life were recorded beyond the impairments described below. When testing goodwill for impairment, consideration was given to Sonys market capitalization in relation to the sum of the calculated fair values of the reporting units, including reporting units with no goodwill, and taking into account corporate level assets and liabilities not assigned to individual reporting units as well as a reasonable control premium. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony recorded an impairment loss of 7,655 million yen for a reporting unit in All Other, which was related to goodwill recorded for Sonys acquisition of Gracenote, Inc. (Gracenote), a company that provides technology and services for digital media identification, enrichment and recommendation. The impairment charge for Gracenote reflected the impact of weakened economic conditions, which resulted in lower growth forecasts for several key markets serviced by Gracenote, including the automotive and mobile communications markets. The valuation of Gracenote also decreased due to the use of a higher discount rate in calculating the present value of future cash flows to reflect higher perceived economic risk due to the economic downturn. The carrying amounts of goodwill by segment as of March 31, 2011 are as follows: Yen in millions Consumer, Professional & Devices 68,372 Networked Products & Services 123,285 Pictures 140,584 Music 102,688 Financial Services 2,314 All Other 31,762 Total 469,005 The above amounts by segment reflect the reorganization that was effective as of April 1, 2010. This reorganization did not result in any changes in the composition of reporting units and accordingly has no impact on the assignment of goodwill within any reporting unit. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable; however, in the future, changes in estimates resulting in lower than currently anticipated cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations, which may result in Sony recognizing impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment analysis performed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony applied a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in a failure of step one of the goodwill impairment test. The significant assumptions utilized by management and related uncertainties with respect to a reporting unit within the Pictures segment, in which a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in fair value would have resulted in a failure of step one of the goodwill impairment test in the previous fiscal year, and the Game reporting unit, which achieved operating profit in the current fiscal year but which has experienced recent operating losses, are described below. 87 Table of Contents Pictures Reporting Unit For the Production and Distribution reporting unit within the Pictures segment, as of March 31, 2011, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would not have resulted in that reporting unit failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. As of March 31, 2011, this reporting unit had 80,074 million yen of goodwill and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by approximately 22 percent. Sony determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis included the projected cash flows from the most recent three year business plan plus an additional seven years of projected cash flows based off of the three year plan. A terminal value was included in this discounted cash flow analysis. The terminal value was based on an exit price in year ten using an earnings multiple and control premium applied to the projected year ten cash flows. The significant estimates and assumptions used included the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, growth rates, timing and amount of future cash flows and the earnings multiple. A discount rate of 9.5 percent was applied to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and was derived from the weighted average cost of capital of market participants in similar businesses. Changes in the financial markets, such as an increase in interest rates or an increase in the expected required return on equity for the entertainment industry, could increase the discount rate in the future, thus decreasing the fair value of the reporting unit. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in the discount rate, holding all other assumptions constant, would not have decreased the fair value of the reporting unit below that of its carrying value, thereby resulting in the reporting unit not failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The earnings multiple and control premium used to calculate the terminal value was obtained through research analyst estimates and values observed in private market transactions. A decrease in the expected cash flow growth rate or profitability in this industry could decrease the earnings multiple and thus decrease the fair value of the reporting unit. A number of key assumptions were used in developing the most recent business plan, the future cash flows and the growth rate of the reporting unit including: (1) the current and expected economic climate and its projected impact on discretionary consumer spending and the advertising market, (2) the historical decline in DVD sales partially offset by an increase in DVD rental revenue, (3) the continued adoption of Blu-ray Disc and digital formats, (4) the continued development and production of event or tent-pole and animated motion picture properties and (5) changes in the cost structure of the reporting unit related to overhead, marketing and motion picture and television production costs. Growth rates assumed beyond the current business plan took into consideration managements outlook for the future and were compared to historical performance to assess reasonableness. The assumed growth rate beyond the current three year business plan was approximately 5 percent. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in the growth rate, holding all other assumptions constant, would not have decreased the fair value of the reporting unit below that of its carrying value, thereby resulting in the reporting unit not failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The following uncertainties are associated with the key assumptions described above and could have a negative effect on the most recent business plan, the future cash flows and the growth rate of the reporting unit:  The cost of productions and marketing, labor costs, consumer acceptance, timing of releases or syndication sales and the availability of competing products and entertainment alternatives could vary from the amounts assumed in Sonys projections.  Incremental deterioration of major retailers, acceleration of the maturation of the DVD format and increasing competition for retailer shelf space could result in a more rapid decline in DVD sales worldwide beyond Sonys expectations.  The reporting unit is subject to digital theft and illegal downloading, which have become increasingly prevalent with the development of new technologies and the availability of broadband internet connections. The availability of unauthorized content contributes to a decrease in legitimate product sales and puts pressure on the price of legitimate product sales. This could negatively impact the sales and profitability assumptions included in the projections. 88 Table of Contents  Foreign exchange rate fluctuations beyond the rates included in the cash flow estimates could affect financial results of the reporting unit because a large portion of the reporting units sales and assets are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is the reporting currency of the reporting unit.  A significant portion of the reporting units revenues are from the licensing of its image-based software, including its motion picture and television content, to U.S. and international television networks, which derive a majority of their revenues from the sale of advertising. The reporting unit, to a lesser extent, also directly sells advertising for its image-based software. If the advertising market is negatively impacted compared to the assumptions in the business plan, this could adversely impact the cash flows of the reporting unit. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis summarized above, actual results may differ which could significantly alter the fair value of the reporting unit and possibly cause the reporting unit to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test. Game Reporting Unit Fair value for the Game reporting unit, which had 123,285 million yen of goodwill as of March 31, 2011, was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis including projected cash flows from the most recent three year business plan as well as a terminal value. The estimated fair value for the Game reporting unit at its annual impairment testing date substantially exceeded its carrying value. Sony developed estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, taking into consideration the recent historical operating losses and the achievement of operating profit in the current fiscal year. The significant estimates and assumptions included the timing and amount of future cash flows, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the perpetual growth rate used to calculate the terminal value. These assumptions included (1) the projected growth rate of the game console installed base and the related assumptions regarding (2) projected software revenue, (3) projected peripherals revenue, (4) the continued expansion of the online network business and (5) the pricing of game consoles, particularly the PS3, relative to production cost. The following uncertainties are associated with the key assumptions described above and could have a negative effect on the most recent business plan, the future cash flows and the perpetual growth rate of the reporting unit:  The levels of future game console sales, particularly the PS3, are uncertain and subject to competitive market forces, technological advances and timing of the introduction of new features and platforms by Sony and its competitors. PS3 hardware unit sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 are estimated to reach 15 million units, which is an increase of approximately 0.7 million units over the previous fiscal year. Future game console sales levels may vary from Sonys projections depending on future pricing, competitors actions and the introduction of new technologies by Sony and others into the marketplace.  The continued stable cash flows from software sales driven by the growth of the game console installed base, which is projected to offset declines in software revenue from older gaming platforms, could be negatively impacted by declines in future royalties received from third party software developers, lower game console sales or an inability to provide an attractive line-up of software to customers.  The growth of cash flows from new products introduced, such as PlayStation®Vita, could vary from Sonys projections.  The continued expansion of online network cash flows, building upon the networking or functionality of the PS3 and other Sony products, leading to user fees, software, music and video download revenue and ancillary revenue is uncertain and is based on limited historical experience coupled with industry projections. The future growth of the game console installed base, future royalty rates, overall online market growth and the ability to realize synergies from other Sony businesses as connectivity between non-gaming devices increases is projected to exceed revenue reductions resulting from lower sales of older models of game consoles and related software. Such future growth is uncertain and may vary from Sonys estimates. During the spring of 2011, the network services of PlayStation®Network, Qriocitytm and Sony Online 89 Table of Contents Entertainment LLC came under cyber-attack. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the continued expansion of online network cash flows based on the information currently available to Sony.  The timing and level of research and development cash flows for future investments required to provide products that maintain competitiveness could vary from Sonys projections. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis summarized above, actual results may differ which could significantly alter the fair value of the reporting unit. The uncertainties described above were considered when selecting the perpetual growth rate, which was set after an initial three-year forecasted period, and the discount rate used in the fair value calculation as described above. The perpetual growth rate applied to determine fair value was 1.5 percent, which was based on historical experience as well as anticipated economic conditions, industry data and Sonys long term outlook for the business. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. The discount rate, applied to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit, was 7.7 percent and considered the weighted-average cost of capital of market participants in similar businesses. Changes in the financial markets, such as an increase in interest rates or an increase in the expected required return on equity by market participants within the industry, could increase the discount rate, thus decreasing the fair value of the reporting unit. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value estimate as it relates to the discount and perpetual growth rates, Sony hypothetically assumed, while holding all other assumptions constant, a combination of a one percentage point increase in the discount rate and a one percentage point decrease in the perpetual growth rate used, both of which would result in lower estimates of fair value, and concluded that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would continue to substantially exceed the carrying value. Pension benefit costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on certain assumptions including discount rates, retirement rates and mortality rates, which are based upon current statistical data, as well as expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets and other factors. Specifically, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets are two critical assumptions in the determination of periodic pension costs and pension liabilities. Assumptions are evaluated at least annually, or at the time when events occur or circumstances change and these events or changes could have a significant effect on these critical assumptions. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Therefore, actual results generally affect recognized costs and the recorded obligations for pensions in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys pension obligations and future costs. Sonys principal pension plans are its Japanese pension plans. No individual foreign pension plan is significant to consolidated pension plan assets and pension obligations. To determine the benefit obligation of the Japanese pension plans, Sony used a discount rate of 2.1 percent for its Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2011. The discount rate was determined by using information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit obligation in consideration of amounts and timing of cash outflows for expected benefit payments. Such available information about rates of returns is collected from published market information and credit rating agencies. The 2.1 percent discount rate represents a 20 basis point decrease from the 2.3 percent discount rate used for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 and reflects current Japanese market interest rate conditions. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Sony considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on various categories of pension plan assets. Sonys pension investment policy recognizes the expected growth and the variability risk associated with the long term nature of pension liabilities, the returns and risks of diversification across asset classes, and the correlation among assets. The asset allocations are designed to maximize returns consistent with levels of liquidity and investment risk that are considered prudent and reasonable. While the pension investment 90 Table of Contents policy gives appropriate consideration to recent market performance and historical returns, the investment assumptions utilized by Sony are designed to achieve a long term return consistent with the long term nature of the corresponding pension liabilities. For Japanese pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 3.6 percent and 2.9 percent as of March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The actual return on pension plan assets for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2011 was a 12.4 percent gain and a 0.8 percent gain, respectively. Actual results that differ from the expected return on pension plan assets are accumulated and amortized as a component of pension costs over the average future service period, thereby reducing the year-to-year volatility in pension costs. As of March 31, 2010 and 2011, Sony had, with respect to Japanese pension plans, net actuarial losses of 270.2 billion yen and 278.9 billion yen, respectively, including losses related to pension plan assets. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the net actuarial loss increased since the actual rate of return on pension plan assets was lower than the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The following table illustrates the effect on the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 of changes in the discount rate and the expected return on pension plan assets, while holding all other assumptions as of March 31, 2011 constant, for Japanese pension plans. Projected benefit Pension Equity Change in assumption obligations costs (Net of tax) (Yen in billions) 25 basis point increase / decrease in discount rate −/+27.7 −/+1.9 +/−1.1 25 basis point increase / decrease in expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets  −/+1.3 +/−0.8 Deferred tax asset valuation Carrying amounts of deferred tax assets require a reduction by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically with appropriate consideration given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. Managements judgments related to this assessment consider, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses on an individual tax jurisdiction basis, forecasts of future profitability after consideration of uncertain tax positions, excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, Sonys experience with operating loss carryforwards not expiring unused, as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies which would be employed by Sony to prevent net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from expiring unutilized. As a result of losses incurred in recent years, Sony Corporation in Japan, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. (SCEA) in the U.S., and the U.K. entities Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited (SCEE) and Sony Europe Limited (SEU) are each in a three year cumulative pre-tax loss position. A cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets. Sony Americas Holding Inc. (SAHI), the consolidated group of which SCEA is a member, also has significant deferred tax assets in the form of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and has incurred pre-tax losses in recent years. Sony has concluded that with respect to the U.S. and U.K. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence when considering future forecasted income, the relatively long carryforward periods in the U.S. and the U.K. and the use of tax planning strategies. The tax planning strategies include changes in tax depreciation and amortization methods, legal and operational restructuring in the U.K. and significant portions of Europe and the sales of certain assets that could realize the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of those assets. Sony believes that the tax planning strategies coupled with future earnings forecasts of the historically profitable entities would produce sufficient taxable income in these entities to fully realize the deferred 91 Table of Contents tax assets. Accordingly, no significant valuation allowance has been recorded for the U.S. or U.K. entities as of March 31, 2011. Notwithstanding the above, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be significantly reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income from the tax planning strategies and forecasted earnings during the tax loss carryforward period are significantly lower than currently estimated due to deterioration in economic conditions or Sonys failure to achieve its business objectives. Sony Corporation and its national tax filing group in Japan are in a three year cumulative loss position in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. In Japan, Sony Corporation files a standalone tax filing for local tax purposes and a consolidated national tax filing with its wholly owned Japanese subsidiaries for national tax purposes. As the national tax filing group only includes wholly owned subsidiaries, certain Japanese subsidiaries are excluded, the most significant of which are Sony Financial Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries. Due to the three consecutive years of losses, and because the net operating losses in Japan have a relatively short carryforward period of 7 years, a limited number of years of the carryforward period remain. The first year of expiration of the remaining net operating losses in Japan would be 2014 for local tax and 2016 for national tax. As described above, carrying amounts of deferred tax assets require a reduction by a valuation allowance if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. While the three year cumulative loss position and the remaining limited years in the carryforward period are significant negative evidence, there is positive evidence in the form of a history of taxable income and a history of utilizing assets before expiration, as well as the availability of tax strategies regarding the utilization of the deferred tax assets. However, based on the near term forecast including the anticipated impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the lesser weight provided to longer range forecasts when an entity is in a three year cumulative loss, Sony does not believe that the objectively verifiable positive evidence is sufficient to overcome the significant negative evidence of the three year cumulative loss. As the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objectively verifiable negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Accordingly, Sony, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, established a valuation allowance of 362,316 million yen as of March 31, 2011. The amount of the deferred tax assets as it relates to Sony Corporation, SAHI, SCEA, SCEE and SEU takes into account the uncertain tax positions related to the more likely than not adjustments for Sonys intercompany transfer pricing. Such transfer pricing is currently under review by the relevant governments as a result of a competent authority request and applications for Bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) filed in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. Sony is required to estimate the final outcome of those government to government negotiations in recording its tax positions, including the allocation and amount of deferred tax assets among the various legal entities as of the balance sheet date. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, certain of the APAs were settled, and the impact of those agreements has been taken into account in the amount of deferred tax assets. It is possible that the remaining advance pricing agreement negotiations could result in a different allocation of profits and losses than those currently estimated by management, and that such allocation could have an adverse impact on the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. Sony may record adjustments to its provision for uncertain tax positions and, accordingly, to its valuation allowance assessments, as additional evidence becomes available. The estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets, which is based on currently enacted tax laws and rates as of the balance sheet date, reflects managements judgment and best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in Sonys financial statements and tax returns, the ability to implement various tax planning strategies and, in certain cases, future forecasts, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates in tax jurisdictions in which Sony operates could affect actual tax results, and market or economic deterioration or failure of management to achieve its restructuring objectives could affect future business results, either of which could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. If future results are less than projected, if APAs negotiations result in a different allocation of profits and losses than currently anticipated, if tax planning alternatives are no longer viable, or if there is no excess appreciated asset value over the tax basis of the assets contemplated for sale, further valuation allowance may be required in the future to reduce the deferred tax assets to their net realizable value. These factors and other changes that are not anticipated in current estimates could have a material impact on Sonys earnings or financial condition in the period or periods in which they are recorded. 92 Table of Contents Film accounting An aspect of film accounting that requires the exercise of judgment relates to the process of estimating the total revenues to be received throughout a films life cycle. Such estimate of a films ultimate revenue is important for two reasons. First, while a film is being produced and the related costs are being capitalized, it is necessary for management to estimate the ultimate revenue, less additional costs to be incurred, including exploitation costs which are expensed as incurred, in order to determine whether the value of a film has been impaired and thus requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film costs. Second, the amount of film costs recognized as cost of sales for a given film as it is exhibited in various markets throughout its life cycle is based upon the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to the estimated ultimate total revenues. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on several factors including the historical performance of similar genre films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses, the expected number of theaters at which the film will be released, anticipated performance in the home entertainment, television and other ancillary markets, and agreements for future sales. Management updates such estimates on a regular basis based on the actual results to date and estimated future results for each film. For example, a film that has resulted in lower than expected theatrical revenues in its initial weeks of release would generally have its theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution ultimate revenues adjusted downward; a failure to do so would result in the understatement of amortized film costs for the period. Future insurance policy benefits Liabilities for future insurance policy benefits are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force. These liabilities, which require significant management judgment and estimates, are computed by the net level premium method based upon the assumptions as to future investment yield, morbidity, mortality, withdrawals and other factors. Future policy benefits are computed using interest rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 4.6 percent and are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Morbidity, mortality and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on either the subsidiarys own experience or various actuarial tables. Generally these assumptions are locked-in throughout the life of the contract upon the issuance of new insurance, although significant changes in experience or assumptions may require Sony to provide for expected future losses. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Multiple element arrangements and software deliverables In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of vendor-specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on managements best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the guidance eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. Also in October 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and are accounted for under the revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements. Sony adopted the new guidance on April 1, 2010. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Transfers of financial assets In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets. This guidance amends previous guidance by including: the elimination of the QSPE concept; a new participating interest definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting; clarifications and changes to the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale; and a change to the amount of recognized gain or loss on a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial 93 Table of Contents interests are received by the transferor. Additionally, the guidance requires new disclosures regarding an entitys involvement in a transfer of financial assets. Finally, existing QSPEs must be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance upon the elimination of this concept. This guidance was effective for Sony as of April 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Variable interest entities In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for determining whether to consolidate a VIE. This guidance changes the approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE from a quantitative risk and reward model to a qualitative model based on control, and requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. This guidance was effective for Sony as of April 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses In July 2010, the FASB issued new disclosure guidance regarding credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses. This guidance expands disclosures for the allowance for credit losses and financing receivables. It also requires disclosure of credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of financing receivables. The additional disclosures are required for Sony beginning in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, with prospective application. Since this guidance impacts disclosures only, its adoption has no impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. The additional disclosures are included in Note 12 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts In October 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. Under the new guidance acquisition costs are to include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts by applying a model similar to the accounting for loan origination costs. An entity may defer incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or employees as well as the portion of employee compensation and other costs directly related to underwriting, policy issuance and processing, medical inspection, and contract selling for successfully negotiated contracts. Additionally, an entity may capitalize as a deferred acquisition cost only those advertising costs meeting the capitalization criteria for direct-response advertising. This change is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2012. Sony will apply this guidance prospectively from the date of adoption. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. Goodwill impairment testing for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts In December 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that modifies the first step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are consistent with existing authoritative guidance, which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. This guidance is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations In December 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance addressing when a business combination should be assumed to have occurred for the purpose of providing pro forma disclosure. The new guidance requires 94 Table of Contents disclosure of revenue and income of the combined entity as though the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior reporting period. The guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The guidance is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2011. Sony will apply the guidance prospectively for any future acquisitions. Since this guidance impacts disclosures only, its adoption will not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) In May 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to substantially converge fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP and IFRS, including a consistent definition of fair value. The amendments will change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for the new guidance to result in a change in the application of the existing guidance for fair value measurements. However, some of the amendments clarify the FASBs intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively and is effective for Sony in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. Item 6.

The following table and accompanying footnotes show the information on such matters that Sony Corporation has disclosed in its annual Securities Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 filed on June 28, 2011 with the Director General of the Kanto Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Japan.

Of the amount that Sony Corporation expects to pay as Retirement Allowances, the amount paid under the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan was calculated using the closing price of Sony Corporations Common Stock on the TSE of the day before the date of resignation (June 28, 2011). ****** In addition to the above, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 Sony Corporation issued Stock Acquisition Rights for the purpose of granting stock options to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers, and recorded 16 million yen in expenses for Directors (16 million yen for Outside Directors) and 606 million yen in expenses for Corporate Executive Officers, respectively. 103 Table of Contents (2) Amounts of remuneration paid by Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers on an individual basis Retirement Allowances Granted Bonus linked (including phantom Number of Basic to restricted stock Stock Acquisition Name Position Remuneration business results plan) Total Rights* (Yen in (Yen in (Yen in (Yen in (Thousand millions) millions) millions) millions) Shares) Howard Stringer Sony Corporation Director, Chairman, CEO & President, and Representative Corporate Executive Officer** 189 *** 32  345 500 Sony Corporation of America Chairman & CEO 106 18  Ryoji Chubachi Sony Corporation Director, Vice Chairman and Representative Corporate Executive Officer** 83 40  123 80 Kazuo Hirai Sony Corporation Executive Deputy President and Representative Corporate Executive Officer 34 *** 17  101 50 Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.

Refer to Note 17 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page F-63 of this report for details. The weighted-average fair value per share does not indicate the actual value that would be realized by a Director or Corporate Executive Officer upon the exercise of the above-mentioned stock acquisition rights. The actual value, if any, that is realized by a Director or Corporate Executive Officer upon the exercise of any stock acquisition rights will depend on the extent to which the market value of Sony Corporations Common Stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock acquisition rights on the date of exercise, and several other restrictions imposed on the exercise of the stock acquisition rights, including the period when a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer could exercise the stock acquisition rights. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the value realized or to be realized by a Director or Corporate Executive Officer upon the exercise of the stock acquisition rights is or will be at or near the weighted-average fair value per share presented above. In addition, the above weighted-average fair value per share was calculated to recognize compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 for accounting purposes and should not be regarded as any indication or prediction of Sony with respect to its future stock performance. ** Howard Stringer and Ryoji Chubachi concurrently serve as Directors of Sony Corporation; however, Sony Corporation does not pay any remuneration for services as Director to Directors who concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officers. *** Apart from the remuneration contained in the above table, Sony also provided certain of its Corporate Executive Officers with certain personal benefits and perquisites, including fringe benefits (and in some instances Sony paid the Corporate Executives income taxes related to their perquisites), during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011: for Howard Stringer Chairman, CEO & President, Sony Corporation  12 million yen / Sony Corporation of America  7 million yen; for Kazuo Hirai Executive Deputy President, Sony Corporation  3 million yen / Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.  3 million yen; and for Nicole Seligman EVP, Sony Corporation  9 million yen / Sony Corporation of America  5 million yen. (3) Basic policy regarding remuneration for Directors and Corporate Executive Officers The basic policy regarding remuneration for Directors and Corporate Executive Officers, as determined by the Compensation Committee, is as follows: (a) Basic policy of Director remuneration Taking into account that the primary duty of the Directors is to supervise the performance of business operations of Sony group as a whole and the fact that Sony Corporation is a global company, in order to improve such supervisory function of the Directors, the following two elements constitute the basic policy for the determination of the remuneration of Directors:  Attracting and retaining an adequate talent pool of Directors possessing the requisite abilities to excel in the global marketplace; and  Ensuring the effectiveness of the supervisory function of the Directors. Based upon the above, the remuneration of Directors shall consist of the following two components:  Fixed remuneration; and  Phantom Restricted Stock Plan. The schedule for the amount of each component and its percentage of total remuneration shall be determined in accordance with the basic policy above. Remuneration of Directors shall be at an appropriate level determined based upon research made by a third party regarding remuneration of directors of both domestic and foreign companies. Director remuneration shall not be paid to those Directors who concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officers. Regarding the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan which was introduced in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, points fixed every year by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Directors every year during his/her 105 Table of Contents tenure, and at the time of resignation, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying Sony Corporations Common Stock price by accumulated points. The resigning Director shall purchase Sony Corporations Common Stock with this remuneration. (b) Basic policy of Corporate Executive Officer remuneration Taking into account that Corporate Executive Officers are key members of management responsible for executing the business operations of Sony, in order to further improve the business results of Sony Corporation, the following two elements shall constitute the basic policy for the determination of the remuneration of Corporate Executive Officers:  Attracting and retaining an adequate talent pool of Corporate Executive Officers possessing the requisite abilities to excel in the global marketplace; and  Providing effective incentives to improve business results on a short, medium and long term basis. Based upon the above, remuneration of Corporate Executive Officers shall consist of the following four components:  Fixed remuneration;  Bonus linked to business results;  Remuneration linked to share price; and  Phantom Restricted Stock Plan. The schedule for the amount of each component and its percentage of total remuneration shall be determined in accordance with the above basic policy with an emphasis on linking remuneration to business results and shareholder value. Remuneration of Corporate Executive Officers shall be at an appropriate level determined based upon research made by a third party regarding remuneration of management of both domestic and foreign companies. Specifically, the amount of bonus linked to business results shall be determined based upon consolidated business results of Sony Corporation, such as operating margin and the level of achievement in respect of the business area(s) for which the relevant Corporate Executive Officer is responsible, and the amount paid to Corporate Executive Officers shall fluctuate within the range from 0 percent to 200 percent of the base fixed remuneration amount. Regarding the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan which was introduced in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, points fixed every year by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Corporate Executive Officers* every year during his/her tenure in office, and at the time of resignation, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying Sony Corporations Common Stock price by accumulated points. The resigning Corporate Executive Officer shall purchase Sony Corporations Common Stock with this remuneration. * Corporate Executive Officers, other than Mr. Stringer, Chairman, CEO & President, Mr. Hirai, Executive Deputy President and Ms. Seligman, EVP, are entitled to participate in the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan. Mr. Stringer, Mr. Hirai and Ms. Seligman instead are covered under separate pension plans provided by Sony Corporations subsidiaries in the United States. Board Practices Sony Corporation has adopted a Company with Committees corporate governance system under the Companies Act of Japan (Kaishaho) and related regulations (collectively the Companies Act). Under this system, Sony Corporation has three committees: the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Under the Companies Act, each committee is required to consist of not less than three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. In order to qualify as an outside Director under the Companies Act, a Director must be a person (i) who is not a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiaries, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who 106 Table of Contents has never been a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiaries, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Under the committee system, Directors as such have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except for limited circumstances as permitted by law. The Board of Directors must elect Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko-yaku), who are responsible for the execution of the business of Sony Corporation. A summary of the governance system adopted by Sony Corporation is set forth below. The Board of Directors determines fundamental management policy and other important matters related to the management of Sony and oversees the performance of the duties of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has the power and authority to appoint and dismiss the members of Sony Corporations three committees and Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Companies Act, all Directors must be elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders from the candidates determined by the Nominating Committee. Under the Companies Act, the term of office of Directors expires at the conclusion of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. Directors may serve any number of consecutive terms although, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, outside Directors may not be reelected more than five times without the consent of all Directors nor more than eight times even if the consent of all Directors is obtained. Yotaro Kobayashi and Yoshiaki Yamauchi were each reelected for an eighth term and Sir Peter Bonfield was reelected for a sixth term as an outside Director at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 28, 2011 upon nomination by the Nominating Committee with the consent of all Directors pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors. The Nominating Committee, which pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation consists of five or more Directors, determines the content of proposals to be submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors. As stated above, under the Companies Act, a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee must be outside Directors. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, at least two members of the Nominating Committee must concurrently be Corporate Executive Officers. The Nominating Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 28, 2011: Yotaro Kobayashi, who is the Chair of the Nominating Committee and an outside Director; Peter Bonfield, Fujio Cho, Roland A. Hernandez, Yorihiko Kojima and Yuichiro Anzai, who are each outside Directors; and Howard Stringer and Ryoji Chubachi, who are Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, the Audit Committee must consist of three or more Directors, a majority of whom, as stated above, must be outside Directors. In addition, under the Companies Act, a member of the Audit Committee may not concurrently be a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiaries, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Further, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, members of the Audit Committee must meet the independence and other equivalent requirements of U.S. securities laws and regulations to the extent applicable to Sony Corporation. The Audit Committees primary responsibility is to review the consolidated and non-consolidated financial statements and business reports to be submitted by the Board of Directors at the General Meeting of Shareholders; to monitor the performance of duties by Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (with respect to structures to ensure the adequacy of the financial reporting process, to enable management to ensure the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, to ensure timely and appropriate disclosure and to ensure compliance with any applicable law, Articles of Incorporation and internal policies and rules, and with respect to the status of any other items described in the Internal Control and Governance Framework determined or reaffirmed by the Board of Directors in accordance with Article 416, paragraph 1, item (1) of the Companies Act), in each case pursuant to the Companies Act; and to propose the appointment/dismissal or non-reappointment of, approve the compensation of, and oversee and evaluate the work of Sonys independent auditor and its independence and qualification. Under the Companies Act, the Audit Committee has a statutory duty to prepare and submit each year its audit report (Kansa-hokoku) to the Corporate Executive Officer designated by the Board of Directors. A member of the Audit Committee may note his or her opinion in the audit report if it is different from the opinion of the Audit Committee that is expressed in the audit report. 107 Table of Contents The Audit Committee discusses with Sony Corporations independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, the scope and results of audits by the independent auditor including their evaluation of Sony Corporations internal controls, compatibility with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., and the overall quality of financial reporting. The Audit Committee makes an assessment of the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata by overseeing their activities through regular communications and discussions with them, and by pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be provided. The Audit Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 28, 2011: Yoshiaki Yamauchi, who is the Chair of the Audit Committee and an outside Director, and Mitsuaki Yahagi and Kanemitsu Anraku, who are also outside Directors. Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Kanemitsu Anraku are each audit committee financial experts within the meaning of Item 16A of this report. As required by the Companies Act, the Compensation Committee determines the policy and the content of compensation, bonus and any other benefits (including equity-related rights or options given for the purpose of stock incentive options) to be received by each Director and Corporate Executive Officer in consideration of the execution of their duties. In addition to such statutory duties, the Compensation Committee sets policy on the composition of individual compensation to be received by other senior management of Sony Group (Directors or other officers of Sony Group companies whose appointment is subject to approval by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Sony Corporation), and also submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the issuance of stock acquisition rights for the purpose of granting stock options and other forms of stock price-based compensation utilizing shares etc. of Sony Group, as individual compensation to the aforementioned senior management. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee shall consist of three or more Directors, and as a general rule, at least one member shall concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officer; provided, however, that a Director who is the CEO or the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Sony Group or in any equivalent position shall not be a member of the Compensation Committee. As stated above, a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee must be outside Directors. The Compensation Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 28, 2011: Ryuji Yasuda, who is the Chair of the Compensation Committee and an outside Director, and Tsun-yan Hsieh and Osamu Nagayama, who are also outside Directors. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the Board of Directors convened ten times. The Nominating Committee met six times, the Audit Committee met ten times and the Compensation Committee met eight times. All 12 outside Directors participated in all meetings of the Board of Directors held during his/her tenure period of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 except for Yukako Uchinaga, Roland A. Hernandez and Osamu Nagayama. (Yukako Uchinaga and Roland A. Hernandez each participated in nine meetings out of ten; Osamu Nagayama participated in six meetings out of seven.) Also, all 11 outside Directors who are members of Committees participated in at least 75 percent of the aggregate number of meetings of each Committee held during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. All three outside Directors who are members of the Audit Committee participated in all meetings of the Audit Committee held during his/her tenure period of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. No Directors have executed service contracts with Sony providing for benefits upon termination of service as a Director. Under the Companies Act and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, exempt Directors from liabilities to Sony Corporation to the extent permitted by law arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties. Also, in accordance with the Companies Act and its Articles of Incorporation, Sony Corporation has entered into a liability limitation agreement with each outside Director that limits the maximum amount of liabilities owed by each outside Director to Sony Corporation arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties to the greater of either 30 million yen or an amount equal to the aggregate sum of the amounts prescribed in each item of Article 425, Paragraph 1 of the Companies Act. The Board of Directors must appoint one or more Corporate Executive Officers who are authorized to determine matters delegated to them by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Executive Officers are responsible for conducting all the business operations of Sony within the scope of authority delegated by the Board of Directors. As of June 28, 2011, there are seven Corporate Executive Officers, some of whom are also Directors. Significant decision-making authority has been delegated to the CEO and also to each Corporate Executive Officer with respect to investments, strategic alliances and other actions related to the execution of business operations. Sony 108 Table of Contents Corporation believes that this significant delegation enables Sony to be managed in a dynamic and responsive manner. The terms of office of Corporate Executive Officers must expire at the conclusion of the first meeting of the Board of Directors held immediately after the conclusion of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. From among the Corporate Executive Officers who as a general rule are also Directors, the Board of Directors shall elect Representative Corporate Executive Officers. Each Representative Corporate Executive Officer has the statutory authority to represent Sony Corporation in the conduct of its affairs. (Supplementary Information) At a Board meeting held on April 26, 2006, the Board of Directors reaffirmed the internal control and governance framework in effect as of the date of determination and determined to continue to evaluate and improve such framework going forward, as appropriate. At a Board meeting held on May 13, 2009 the Board of Directors reaffirmed such internal control and governance framework, as slightly amended, in effect as of the date of determination and determined to continue to evaluate and improve such amended framework going forward, as appropriate. This determination was required by and met the requirements of the Companies Act. Details of the determination are posted on the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/control.html For an explanation as to the significant differences between the New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance standards and Sonys corporate governance practices, please refer to Disclosure About Differences in Corporate Governance in Item 16G or visit Sonys website at: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/info/strategy/NYSEGovernance.html Employees As of March 31, 2011, Sony had approximately 168,200 employees, approximately the same number of employees as of March 31, 2010. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, while the employee numbers in Europe and Japan decreased due to restructuring initiatives, the employee numbers at manufacturing sites in the Asia-Pacific area (excluding Japan) increased due to recovery and expansion of production. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 59,000 employees were located in Japan and approximately 109,200 employees were located outside Japan. Approximately 26 percent of the total number of employees were members of labor unions. As of March 31, 2010, Sony had approximately 167,900 employees, a decrease of approximately 3,400 employees from March 31, 2009. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, while the employee numbers increased due to the recovery in production at manufacturing sites in the Asia-Pacific area (excluding Japan), the total number of employees decreased due to restructuring initiatives implemented mainly in North America, Japan and Europe. As of March 31, 2010, approximately 60,200 employees were located in Japan and approximately 107,700 employees were located outside Japan. Approximately 23 percent of the total number of employees were members of labor unions. As of March 31, 2009, Sony had approximately 171,300 employees, a decrease of approximately 9,200 employees from March 31, 2008. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, while employees increased due to the consolidation of SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG), the total number of employees decreased significantly due to restructuring and production adjustment implemented in the second half of the fiscal year, mainly at manufacturing sites in the Asia-Pacific area (excluding Japan). As of March 31, 2009, approximately 63,400 employees were located in Japan and approximately 107,900 employees were located outside Japan. Approximately 24 percent of the total number of employees were members of labor unions. 109 Table of Contents The following table shows the number of employees of Sony by segment as of March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Number of Employees by Segment March 31 2009 2010 2011 Consumer, Professional & Devices 116,300 113,800 113,200 Networked Products & Services 13,100 13,800 13,100 Pictures 7,000 6,400 7,000 Music 7,200 7,100 6,800 Financial Services 7,200 7,400 7,500 All Other 11,800 9,700 9,800 Unallocated  Corporate employees 8,700 9,700 10,800 Total* 171,300 167,900 168,200 * Employees of Sony Ericsson were not included in the number of total employees, as it is an equity-method company. As of March 31, 2011, the number of employees in the Consumer, Professional & Devices (CPD), the Networked Products & Services (NPS), and Music segments decreased compared to March 31, 2010, reflecting continuing restructuring initiatives. Corporate employees increased as a result of newly established horizontal platform organizations at the global headquarters. The number of employees in the Picture segment increased, recovering to the level as of March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2010, the number of employees in the CPD and Pictures segments, and All Other decreased compared to March 31, 2009, mainly due to restructuring activities. As a part of transformation efforts during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sonys headquarters established three functional platforms for manufacturing, logistics, procurement and customer services, R&D and common software development, and global sales and marketing. The number of Corporate employees increased as employees transferred from other segments, partially offset by restructuring activities at headquarters. As of March 31, 2009, the number of employees in the NPS segment increased compared to March 31, 2008, primarily as a result of the transfer of Sony Online Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries from the Pictures segment to the NPS segment. The number of employees in the Music segment as of March 31, 2009 increased compared to March 31, 2008, primarily due to the consolidation of SONY BMG as of October 1, 2008. In addition, the average number of employees for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 calculated by averaging the total number of employees at the end of each quarter, was 179,400, 170,200 and 169,900, respectively. Sony generally considers its labor relations to be good. In Japan, Sony Corporation and several subsidiaries have labor unions. Regarding labor relations in the CPD and NPS segments by area, in Asia, where Sony owns many manufacturing sites, a few of these sites have labor unions that have union contracts. In China, most employees are members of labor unions. Sony has maintained good relationships with these labor unions and there have been no industrial dispute during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. In the U.S., no manufacturing sites have labor unions. In Europe, Sony maintains good labor relations with the Work Councils in each country, and, while some employees belong to unions, they are not eligible for union contracts. In the Pictures segment, Sony also generally considers its labor relations to be good. A number of Pictures subsidiaries are signatories to union contracts. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, negotiations for new three-year agreements were successfully concluded with the Screen Actors Guild (Basic Agreement, Television Agreement, Basic Cable Agreement, Animation Agreement and Basic Cable Animation Agreement), the Directors Guild of America, the Writers Guild of America, West and Writers Guild of America, East, and the American 110 Table of Contents Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Exhibit A and CW Supplement of the AFTRA Network Code).

Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions Major Shareholders Dodge & Cox, an institutional investor based in San Francisco, California, filed a report of substantial shareholding with the Director General of the Kanto Bureau of the Ministry of Finance on April 5, 2011. According to this filing, Dodge & Cox owned 29,561,496 American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and 11,185,500 shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2011, representing 4.1 percent of the total. To the knowledge of Sony Corporation, there were no significant changes in the percentage ownership held by any major beneficial shareholders during the past three fiscal years. Major shareholders of Sony Corporation do not have different voting rights. As of March 31, 2011, there were 1,004,636,664 shares of Common Stock outstanding, of which 82,475,633 shares were in the form of ADRs and 146,213,782 shares were held of record in the form of Common Stock by residents in the U.S. As of March 31, 2011, the number of registered ADR holders was 6,659 and the number of registered holders of Common Stock of Sony Corporation in the U.S. was 360. To the knowledge of Sony Corporation, it is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any other corporation, by any foreign government or by any other natural or legal person severally or jointly. As far as is known to Sony Corporation, there are no arrangements the operation of which may, at a subsequent date, result in a change in control of Sony Corporation. Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, Sony purchases materials, supplies, and services from numerous suppliers throughout the world, including firms with which certain members of the Board of Directors are affiliated. In addition, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, Sony entered into the following sales/purchase transactions with equity affiliates accounted for under the equity method: sales to Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson), a joint venture focused on mobile phone handsets, totaling 83.0 billion yen; purchases from S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD), a joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the manufacture of amorphous thin film transistor (TFT) LCD panels, totaling 369.0 billion yen. As of March 31, 2011, Sony held notes and accounts receivable, trade due from Sony Ericsson totaling 14.9 billion yen, in addition to notes and accounts payable, trade due to S-LCD totaling 42.7 billion yen. Because of the size of these transactions, Sony does not consider the amounts involved to be material to its business.

Interests of Experts and Counsel Not Applicable 112 Table of Contents Item 8. Financial Information Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information Refer to the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Legal Proceedings In May 2011, Sony Corporations U.S. subsidiary, Sony Electronics Inc., received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division seeking information about its secondary batteries business. Sony understands that the DOJ is investigating competition in the secondary batteries market. Based on the stage of the proceeding, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements or other resolution of this matter. Beginning earlier in 2011, the network services of PlayStation®Network, Qriocitytm, Sony Online Entertainment LLC and websites of other subsidiaries came under cyber-attack. As of June 28, 2011, Sony has not received any confirmed reports of customer identity theft issues or misuse of credit cards from such cyber-attacks. However, in connection with certain of these matters, Sony has received inquiries from authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including orders for reports issued by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan as well as the Financial Services Agency of Japan, formal and/or informal requests for information from Attorneys General from a number of states in the United States and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, various U.S. congressional inquiries and others. Additionally, Sony Corporation and/or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a number of purported class actions in certain jurisdictions, including the United States. Based on the stage of these inquiries and proceedings, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements or other resolution of these matters. In October 2009, Sony Corporations U.S. subsidiary, Sony Optiarc America Inc., received a subpoena from the DOJ seeking information about its optical disk drive business. Sony understands that the DOJ and agencies outside the United States are investigating competition in optical disk drives. Subsequently, a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed in certain jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the plaintiffs allege that Sony Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries violated antitrust laws and seek recovery of damages and other remedies. Based on the stage of these proceedings, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements or other resolution of these matters. In addition, Sony Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants or otherwise involved in other pending legal and regulatory proceedings. However, based upon the information currently available to Sony and its legal counsel, the management of Sony believes that the outcome from such legal and regulatory proceedings would not have a material effect on Sonys consolidated financial statements. Dividend Policy Sony believes that continuously increasing corporate value and providing dividends are essential to rewarding shareholders. It is Sonys policy to utilize retained earnings, after ensuring the perpetuation of stable dividends, to carry out various investments that contribute to an increase in corporate value such as those that ensure future growth and strengthen competitiveness. A fiscal year-end dividend of 12.5 yen per share of Common Stock of Sony Corporation was approved at the Board of Directors meeting held on May 26, 2011 and the payment of such dividend started on June 9, 2011. Sony Corporation has already paid an interim dividend for Common Stock of 12.5 yen per share to each shareholder; accordingly, the total annual dividend per share of Common Stock for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 is 25.0 yen. Significant Changes No significant change has occurred since the date of the annual financial statements included in this annual report. Item 9.

Selling Shareholders Not Applicable Dilution Not Applicable Expenses of the Issue Not Applicable Item 10. Additional Information Share Capital Not Applicable Memorandum and Articles of Association Organization Sony Corporation is a joint stock corporation (Kabushiki Kaisha) incorporated in Japan under the Companies Act (Kaishaho) of Japan. It is registered in the Commercial Register (Shogyo Tokibo) maintained by the Minato Branch Office of the Tokyo Legal Affairs Bureau. Objects and purposes The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that its purpose is to engage in the following business activities: (i) manufacture and sale of electronic and electrical machines and equipment, medical instruments, optical instruments and other equipment, machines and instruments; (ii) planning, production and sale of audio-visual software and computer software programs; (iii) manufacture and sale of metal industrial products, chemical industrial products and ceramic industrial products, textile products, paper products and wood-crafted articles, daily necessities, foodstuffs and toys, transportation machines and equipment, and petroleum and coal products; (iv) real estate activities, construction business, transportation business and warehousing business; (v) publishing business and printing business; (vi) advertising agency business, insurance agency business, broadcasting enterprise, recreation business such as travel, management of sporting facilities, etc. and other service enterprises; (vii) financial business; (viii) Type I and Type II telecommunications business under the Telecommunications Business Law; (ix) investing in stocks and bonds, etc.; (x) manufacture, sale, export and import of products which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above; (xi) rendering of services related to those mentioned above; 115 Table of Contents (xii) investment in businesses mentioned above operated by other companies or persons; and (xiii) all businesses which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above. Directors Under the Companies Act, because Sony Corporation has adopted the Company with Committees system, Directors have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except in limited circumstances as permitted by law. If a Director also serves concurrently as a Corporate Executive Officer, then he or she can execute the business of Sony Corporation in the capacity of Corporate Executive Officer. Under the Companies Act, Directors must refrain from engaging in any business competing with Sony Corporation unless approved by the Board of Directors, and any Director who has a material interest in the subject matter of a resolution to be taken by the Board of Directors cannot vote on such resolution. The amount of remuneration to each Director is determined by the Compensation Committee, which consists of Directors, the majority of whom are outside Directors (Refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees). No member of the Compensation Committee may vote on a resolution with respect to his or her own compensation as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Neither the Companies Act nor Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation make a special provision as to the borrowing powers exercisable by Directors (subject to requisite internal authorizations as required by the Companies Act), their retirement age, or a requirement to hold any shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. For more information on Directors, refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees. Capital stock (General) Unless indicated otherwise, set forth below is information relating to Sony Corporations capital stock, including brief summaries of the relevant provisions of Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation and Share Handling Regulations, currently in effect, and of the Companies Act and related regulations. On January 5, 2009, a central book-entry transfer system for shares of Japanese listed companies was established pursuant to the Act Concerning Book-entry Transfer of Corporate Bonds, Shares etc. (including regulations promulgated thereunder, Book-entry Transfer Act), and this system is applied to the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation. Under this system, shares of all Japanese companies listed on any Japanese stock exchange are dematerialized, and shareholders must have accounts at account management institutions to hold their shares unless such shareholder has an account at Japan Securities Depository Center, Inc. (JASDEC). Account management institutions are financial instruments traders (i.e., securities companies), banks, trust companies and certain other financial institutions that meet the requirements prescribed by the Book-entry Transfer Act. Transfer of the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation is effected exclusively through entry in the records maintained by JASDEC and the account management institutions, and title to the shares passes to the transferee at the time when the transfer of the shares is recorded at the transferees account at an account management institution. The holder of an account at an account management institution is presumed to be the legal holder of the shares recorded in such account. Under the Companies Act and the Book-entry Transfer Act, in order to assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation, a shareholder of shares must have its name and address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, shareholders shall notify the relevant account management institutions of certain information prescribed under the Book-entry Transfer Act or Sony Corporations Share Handling Regulations, including their names and addresses, and the registration on Sony Corporations register of shareholders is updated upon receipt by Sony Corporation of necessary information from JASDEC (as described in Record date). On the other hand, in order to assert, against Sony Corporation, shareholders rights to which shareholders are entitled regardless of record dates such as minority shareholders rights, including the right to propose a matter to be considered at a General Meeting of Shareholders, except for shareholders rights to request that Sony Corporation purchase or sell shares constituting less than a full unit (as 116 Table of Contents described in Unit share system), JASDEC shall, upon the shareholders request, issue a notice of certain information, including the name and address of such shareholder, to Sony Corporation. Thereafter, such shareholder is required to present Sony Corporation a receipt of the notice request in accordance with the Sony Corporations Share Handling Regulations. Under the Book-entry Transfer Act, the shareholder shall exercise such shareholders right within four weeks after the notice above has been given to Sony Corporation. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation is the transfer agent for Sony Corporations capital stock. As such, it keeps Sony Corporations register of shareholders in its office at 4-5, Marunouchi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. Non-resident shareholders are required to appoint a standing proxy in Japan or file notice of a mailing address in Japan. Notices from Sony Corporation to non-resident shareholders are delivered to such standing proxies or mailing address. Japanese securities companies and commercial banks customarily act as standing proxies and provide related services for standard fees. The recorded holder of deposited shares underlying the American Depositary Shares (ADSs) is the depositary for the ADSs. Accordingly, holders of ADSs will not be able to directly assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation. (Authorized capital) Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may only issue shares of Common Stock. Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide that the total number of shares authorized to be issued by Sony Corporation is 3.6 billion shares. All shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation have no par value. All issued shares are fully-paid and non-assessable. (Distribution of Surplus) Distribution of Surplus  General Under the Companies Act, distributions of cash or other assets by joint stock corporations to their shareholders, so called dividends, are referred to as distributions of Surplus (Surplus is defined in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus). Sony Corporation may make distributions of Surplus to shareholders any number of times per business year, subject to certain limitations described in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Distributions of Surplus are required in principle to be authorized by a resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders, but Sony Corporation may authorize distributions of Surplus by a resolution of the Board of Directors as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. Distributions of Surplus may be made in cash or in kind in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder. A resolution of the Board of Directors or a General Meeting of Shareholders authorizing a distribution of Surplus must specify the kind and aggregate book value of the assets to be distributed, the manner of allocation of such assets to shareholders, and the effective date of the distribution. If a distribution of Surplus is to be made in kind, Sony Corporation may, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) a General Meeting of Shareholders, grant a right to the shareholders to require Sony Corporation to make such distribution in cash instead of in kind. If no such right is granted to shareholders, the relevant distribution of Surplus must be approved by a special resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders (refer to Voting rights with respect to a special resolution). Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, year-end dividends and interim dividends may be distributed to shareholders appearing in Sony Corporations register of shareholders as of March 31 and September 30 each year, respectively, in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder following approval by the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) the General Meeting of Shareholders. Sony Corporation is not obliged to pay any dividends unclaimed for a period of five years after the date on which they first became payable. 117 Table of Contents In Japan, the ex-dividend date and the record date for dividends precede the date of determination of the amount of the dividends to be paid. The price of the shares of Common Stock generally goes ex-dividend on the second business day prior to the record date (or if the record date is not a business day, the third business day prior thereto). Distribution of Surplus  Restriction on distribution of Surplus In making a distribution of Surplus, Sony Corporation must, until the sum of its additional paid-in capital and legal reserve reaches one quarter of its stated capital, set aside in its additional paid-in capital and/or legal reserve an amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of Surplus so distributed. The amount of Surplus at any given time must be calculated in accordance with the following formula: A + B + C + D − (E + F + G) In the above formula: A = the total amount of other capital surplus and other retained earnings, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year B = (if Sony Corporation has disposed of its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the amount of the consideration for such treasury stock received by Sony Corporation less the book value thereof C = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its stated capital after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) D = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to stated capital (if any) E = (if Sony Corporation has cancelled its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the book value of such treasury stock F = (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to its shareholders after the end of the last business year) the total book value of the Surplus so distributed G = certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if Sony Corporation has reduced Surplus and increased its stated capital, additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction and (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to the shareholders after the end of the last business year) the amount set aside in additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. The aggregate book value of Surplus distributed by Sony Corporation may not exceed a prescribed distributable amount (the Distributable Amount), as calculated on the effective date of such distribution. The Distributable Amount at any given time shall be equal to the amount of Surplus less the aggregate of the following: (a) the book value of its treasury stock; (b) the amount of consideration for any of treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation after the end of the last business year; and (c) certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if the sum of one-half of goodwill and the deferred assets exceeds the total of stated capital, additional paid-in capital and legal reserve, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year) all or certain part of such exceeding amount as calculated in accordance with ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. 118 Table of Contents As Sony Corporation has become a company with respect to which consolidated balance sheets should also be considered in the calculation of the Distributable Amount (renketsu haito kisei tekiyo kaisha), Sony Corporation must further deduct from the amount of Surplus the excess amount, if any, of (x) the total amount of stockholders equity appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice over (y) the total amount of stockholders equity and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice appearing on the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year. If Sony Corporation has prepared interim financial statements as described below, and if such interim financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors or (if so required by the Companies Act) by a General Meeting of Shareholders, then the Distributable Amount must be adjusted to take into account the amount of profit or loss, and the amount of consideration for any of the treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation, during the period in respect of which such interim financial statements have been prepared. Sony Corporation may prepare non-consolidated interim financial statements consisting of a balance sheet as of any date subsequent to the end of the last business year and an income statement for the period from the first day of the current business year to the date of such balance sheet. Interim financial statements so prepared by Sony Corporation must be audited by the Audit Committee and the independent auditor, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. (Capital and reserves) Sony Corporation may generally reduce its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve by resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders and, if so decided by the same resolution, may account for the whole or any part of the amount of such reduction as stated capital. On the other hand, Sony Corporation may generally reduce its stated capital by a special shareholders resolution (as defined in (Voting rights) and, if so decided by the same resolution, may account for the whole or any part of the amount of such reduction as additional paid-in capital. In addition, Sony Corporation may reduce its Surplus and increase either (i) stated capital or (ii) additional paid-in capital and/or legal reserve by the same amount, in either case by resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders. (Stock splits) Sony Corporation may at any time split shares in issue into a greater number of shares at the determination of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and may amend its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of the authorized shares to be issued to allow such stock split pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or a determination by a Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors, rather than relying on a special shareholders resolution, which is otherwise required for amending the Articles of Incorporation. When a stock split is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice of the stock split, specifying the record date thereof, at least two weeks prior to such record date. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, Sony Corporation must also give notice to JASDEC regarding a stock split at least two weeks prior to the relevant effective date of the stock split. On the effective date of the stock split, the numbers of shares recorded in all accounts held by Sony Corporations shareholders at account managing institutions or JASDEC will be increased in accordance with the applicable ratio. (Consolidation of shares) Sony Corporation may at any time consolidate issued shares into a smaller number of shares by a special shareholders resolution. When a consolidation of shares is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice or notice to each shareholder at least two weeks prior to the effective date of the consolidation of shares. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, Sony Corporation must also give notice to JASDEC regarding a consolidation of shares at least two weeks prior to the effective date of the consolidation of shares. On the effective date of the consolidation of shares, the numbers of shares recorded in all accounts held by Sony Corporations shareholders at account managing institutions or JASDEC will be decreased in accordance with the applicable ratio. Sony Corporation must disclose the reason for the consolidation of shares at a General Meeting of Shareholders. 119 Table of Contents (General Meeting of Shareholders) The Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of Sony Corporation for each business year is normally held in June of each year in Tokyo, Japan. In addition, Sony Corporation may hold an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders whenever necessary by giving notice thereof at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Notice of a shareholders meeting setting forth the place, time and purpose thereof must be mailed to each shareholder having voting rights (or, in the case of a non-resident shareholder, to such shareholders resident proxy or mailing address in Japan) at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Under the Companies Act, such notice may be given to shareholders by electronic means, subject to obtaining consent by the relevant shareholders. The record date for an Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders is March 31 of each year. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least three percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may require the convocation of a General Meeting of Shareholders for a particular purpose. Unless such a shareholders meeting is convened promptly or a convocation notice of a meeting which is to be held not later than eight weeks from the day of such demand is dispatched, the requiring shareholder may, upon obtaining a court approval, convene such a shareholders meeting. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 300 voting rights or one percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may propose a matter to be considered at a General Meeting of Shareholders by submitting a written request to Sony Corporation at least eight weeks prior to the date set for such meeting. If the Articles of Incorporation so provide, any of the minimum voting rights or percentages, time periods and number of voting rights necessary for exercising the minority shareholder rights described above may be decreased or shortened. Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation currently do not include any such provisions. (Voting rights) So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, a holder of shares constituting one or more units is entitled to one vote for each such unit of stock (refer to (Unit share system) below; currently 100 shares constitute one unit), except that no voting rights with respect to shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation are afforded to Sony Corporation or any corporate or certain other entity more than one-quarter of the total voting rights of which are directly or indirectly held by Sony Corporation. If Sony Corporation eliminates from its Articles of Incorporation the provisions relating to units of stock, holders of capital stock will have one vote for each share they hold. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, a resolution can be adopted at a General Meeting of Shareholders by a majority of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting. The Companies Act and Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide, however, that the quorum for the election of Directors shall be one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders. Sony Corporations shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of Directors. Shareholders may cast their votes in writing and may also exercise their voting rights through proxies, provided that the proxies are also shareholders holding voting rights. Shareholders may also exercise their voting rights by electronic means pursuant to the method designated by Sony Corporation. The Companies Act and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that in order to amend the Articles of Incorporation and in certain other instances, including: (1) acquisition of its own shares from a specific party other than its subsidiaries; (2) consolidation of shares; (3) any offering of new shares at a specially favorable price (or any offering of stock acquisition rights to acquire shares of capital stock, or bonds with stock acquisition rights on specially favorable conditions) to any persons other than shareholders; (4) the exemption of liability of a Director, Corporate Executive Officer or independent auditor with certain exceptions; (5) a reduction of stated capital with certain exceptions; 120 Table of Contents (6) a distribution of in-kind dividends which meets certain requirements; (7) dissolution, merger, consolidation, or corporate split with certain exceptions; (8) the transfer of the whole or a material part of the business; (9) the taking over of the whole of the business of any other corporation with certain exceptions; or (10) share exchange or share transfer for the purpose of establishing 100 percent parent-subsidiary relationships with certain exceptions, the quorum shall be one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders, and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required (the special shareholders resolutions). (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) Holders of Sony Corporations shares of capital stock have no pre-emptive rights under its Articles of Incorporation. Authorized but unissued shares may be issued at such times and upon such terms as the Board of Directors or the CEO determines, subject to the limitations as to the offering of new shares at a specially favorable price mentioned under (Voting rights) above. In the case of an issuance of shares (including a transfer of treasury shares) of Sony Corporation or its stock acquisition rights by way of an allotment to a third party which would dilute the outstanding voting shares by 25 percent or more or change the controlling shareholder, in addition to a resolution of the Board of Directors, the approval of the shareholders or an affirmative vote from a person independent of the management is generally required pursuant to the regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges on which shares of Sony Corporation are listed. The Board of Directors or the CEO may, however, determine that shareholders shall be given subscription rights regarding a particular issue of new shares, in which case such rights must be given on uniform terms to all shareholders as of a record date of which not less than two weeks prior public notice is given. Each of the shareholders to whom such rights are given must also be given notice of the expiry thereof at least two weeks prior to the date on which such rights expire. Subject to certain conditions, Sony Corporation may issue stock acquisition rights by a resolution of the Board of Directors or a determination by the CEO. Holders of stock acquisition rights may exercise their rights to acquire a certain number of shares within the exercise period as prescribed in the terms of their stock acquisition rights. Upon exercise of stock acquisition rights, Sony Corporation will be obliged to issue the relevant number of new shares or alternatively to transfer the necessary number of treasury stock held by it. In cases where a particular issue of new shares or stock acquisition rights (i) violates laws and regulations or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation, or (ii) will be performed in a manner materially unfair, and shareholders may suffer disadvantages therefrom, such shareholders may file an injunction to enjoin such issue with a court. (Liquidation rights) In the event of a liquidation of Sony Corporation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts, liquidation expenses and taxes will be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock in proportion to the respective numbers of shares of Common Stock held. (Record date) March 31 is the record date for Sony Corporations year-end dividends, if declared. So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, shareholders who are registered as the holders of one or more unit of stock in Sony Corporations register of shareholders at the end of each March 31 are also entitled to exercise shareholders rights at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders with respect to the business year ending on such March 31. September 30 is the record date for interim dividends. In addition, Sony Corporation may set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to other rights and for other purposes by giving at least two weeks prior public notice. 121 Table of Contents JASDEC is required to promptly give Sony Corporation notice of the names and addresses of Sony Corporations shareholders, the numbers of shares of Common Stock held by them and other relevant information as of such respective record dates. The price of shares generally goes ex-dividends or ex-rights on Japanese stock exchanges on the second business day prior to a record date (or if the record date is not a business day, the third business day prior thereto), for the purpose of dividends or rights offerings. (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its capital stock) Under the Companies Act and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may acquire shares of Common Stock (i) from a specific shareholder other than any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to the special shareholders resolution), (ii) from any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to a determination by the CEO as delegated by the Board of Directors), or (iii) by way of purchase on any Japanese stock exchange on which Sony Corporations shares of Common Stock are listed or by way of tender offer (pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice). In the case of (i) above, any other shareholder may make a request to Sony Corporation that such other shareholder be included as a seller in the proposed purchase, provided that no such right will be available if the purchase price or any other consideration to be received by the relevant specific shareholder will not exceed the last trading price of the shares on the relevant stock exchange on the day immediately preceding the date on which the resolution mentioned in (i) above was adopted (or, if there is no trading in the shares on the stock exchange or if the stock exchange is not open on such day, the price at which the shares are first traded on such stock exchange thereafter). The total amount of the purchase price of shares of Common Stock may not exceed the Distributable Amount, as described in (Distribution of Surplus)  Distributions of Surplus  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Shares acquired by Sony Corporation may be held for any period or may be retired at the determination of the CEO. Sony Corporation may also transfer (by public or private sale or otherwise) to any person the treasury shares held by it, subject to a determination by the CEO, and subject also to other requirements similar to those applicable to the issuance of new shares, as described in (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) above. Sony Corporation may also utilize its treasury stock for the purpose of transfer to any person upon exercise of stock acquisition rights or for the purpose of acquiring another company by way of merger, share exchange or corporate split through exchange of treasury stock for shares or assets of the acquired company. (Unit share system) The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that 100 shares constitute one unit of shares of stock. The Board of Directors or the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors is permitted to amend the Articles of Incorporation to reduce the number of shares that constitute a unit or to abolish the unit share system entirely. Under the Companies Act, the number of shares constituting one unit cannot exceed 1,000 shares nor 0.5 percent of the total number of issued shares. Under the unit share system, shareholders have one voting right for each unit of stock that they hold. Any number of shares less than one full unit have neither voting rights nor rights related to voting rights. Holders of shares constituting less than one unit will have no other shareholder rights if Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation so provide, except that such holders may not be deprived of certain rights specified in the Companies Act or an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice, including the right to receive distribution of Surplus. A holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may require Sony Corporation to purchase such shares at their market value in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. In addition, the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that a holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may request Sony Corporation to sell to such holder such amount of shares which will, when added together with the shares constituting less than one full unit, constitute one full unit of stock. Such request by a holder and the 122 Table of Contents sale by Sony Corporation must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. As prescribed in the Share Handling Regulations, such requests shall be made through an account management institution and JASDEC pursuant to the rules set by JASDEC, without going through the notification procedure required for the exercise of shareholders rights entitled regardless of record dates as described in General. Shares constituting less than a full unit are transferable, under the new book-entry transfer system described in General. Under the rules of the stock exchanges, however, shares constituting less than a full unit do not comprise a trading unit, except in limited circumstances, and accordingly may not be sold on the Japanese stock exchanges. (Sale by Sony Corporation of shares held by shareholders whose location is unknown) Sony Corporation is not required to send a notice to a shareholder if a notice to such shareholder fails to arrive at the registered address of the shareholder in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation continuously for five years or more. In addition, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of shares of capital stock for which the location of the shareholder is unknown. Generally, if (i) notices to a shareholder fail to arrive continuously for five years or more at the shareholders registered address in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, and (ii) the shareholder fails to receive distributions of Surplus on the shares continuously for five years or more at the address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of such shareholders shares at the then market price of the shares by a determination of a Corporate Executive Officer and after giving at least three months prior public and individual notice, and hold or deposit the proceeds of such sale or disposal of shares for such shareholder. Reporting of substantial shareholdings The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan and its related regulations require any person, regardless of residence, who has become, beneficially and solely or jointly, a holder of more than five percent of the total issued shares of capital stock of a company listed on any Japanese stock exchange or whose shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in Japan to file with the Director General of the competent Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance within five business days a report concerning such shareholdings. A similar report must also be filed in respect of any subsequent change of one percent or more in any such holding, or any change in material matters set out in reports previously filed, with certain exceptions. For this purpose, shares issuable to such persons upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of share subscription warrants or stock acquisition rights are taken into account in determining both the number of shares held by such holders and the issuers total issued share capital. Any such report shall be filed with the Director General of the relevant Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance through the Electronic Disclosure for Investors Network (EDINET) system. Copies of such report must also be promptly furnished to the issuer of such shares and all Japanese stock exchanges on which such shares are listed. Except for the general limitation under Japanese anti-trust and anti-monopoly regulations against holding of shares of capital stock of a Japanese corporation which leads or may lead to a restraint of trade or monopoly, and except for general limitations under the Companies Act or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation on the rights of shareholders applicable regardless of residence or nationality, there is no limitation under Japanese laws and regulations applicable to Sony Corporation or under its Articles of Incorporation on the rights of non-residents or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. There is no provision in Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation or internal regulations that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Sony Corporation and that would operate only with respect to merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving Sony Corporation. Material Contracts None 123 Table of Contents Exchange Controls The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act of Japan and its related cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances (the Foreign Exchange Regulations) govern the acquisition and holding of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation by exchange non-residents and by foreign investors. The Foreign Exchange Regulations currently in effect do not, however, affect transactions between exchange non-residents to purchase or sell shares outside Japan using currencies other than Japanese yen. Exchange non-residents are:  individuals who do not reside in Japan; and  corporations whose principal offices are located outside Japan. Generally, branches and other offices of non-resident corporations that are located within Japan are regarded as residents of Japan. Conversely, branches and other offices of Japanese corporations located outside Japan are regarded as exchange non-residents. Foreign investors are:  individuals who are exchange non-residents;  corporations that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or whose principal offices are located outside of Japan; and  corporations (i) 50 percent or more of whose shares are held, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are exchange non-residents and/or corporations (a) that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or (b) whose principal offices are located outside of Japan or (ii) a majority of whose officers, or officers having the power of representation, are individuals who are exchange non-residents. In general, the acquisition of shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) by an exchange non-resident from a resident of Japan is not subject to any prior filing requirements. In certain limited circumstances, however, the Minister of Finance may require prior approval of an acquisition of this type. While prior approval, as described above, is not required, in the case where a resident of Japan transfers shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) for consideration exceeding 100 million yen to an exchange non-resident, the resident of Japan who transfers the shares is required to report on the transfer to the Minister of Finance through the Bank of Japan within 20 days from the date of the transfer, unless the transfer was made through a bank, securities company or financial futures trader licensed under Japanese law. If a foreign investor acquires shares of a Japanese company that is listed on a Japanese stock exchange (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) or that is traded on an over-the-counter market in Japan and, as a result of the acquisition, the foreign investor, in combination with any existing holdings, directly or indirectly holds 10 percent or more of the issued shares of the relevant company, the foreign investor must file a report of the acquisition with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers having jurisdiction over that Japanese company by the 15th day of the month immediately following the month in which such acquisition took place. In limited circumstances, such as where the foreign investor is in a country that is not listed on an exemption schedule in the Foreign Exchange Regulations, or where that Japanese company is engaged in certain businesses designated by the Foreign Exchange Regulations, a prior notification of the acquisition must be filed with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers, who may then modify or prohibit the proposed acquisition. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, dividends paid on and the proceeds from sales in Japan of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation held by non-residents of Japan may generally be converted into any foreign currency and repatriated abroad. Taxation The following is a summary of the major Japanese national tax and U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership, acquisition and disposition of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation and of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation by a non-resident of Japan or a 124 Table of Contents non-Japanese corporation without a permanent establishment in Japan. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to any particular investor, and does not take into account any specific individual circumstances of any particular investor. Accordingly, holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the considerations discussed below to their particular circumstances. This summary is based upon the representations of the depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement in relation to the ADSs dated as of June 1, 1961, as amended and restated as of October 31, 1991, as further amended and restated as of March 17, 1995, and as of February 25, 2010, and in any related agreement, will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of the income tax convention between Japan and the United States (the Treaty) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. holders of ADSs generally will be treated as owning shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation underlying the ADSs evidenced by the ADRs. For the purposes of the following discussion, a U.S. holder is a holder that: (i) is a resident of the U.S. for purposes of the Treaty; (ii) does not maintain a permanent establishment in Japan (a) with which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are effectively connected and through which the U.S. holder carries on or has carried on business or (b) of which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation form part of the business property; and (iii) is eligible for benefits under the Treaty with respect to income and gain derived in connection with shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation. The following is a summary of the principal Japanese tax consequences (limited to national taxes) to non-residents of Japan or non-Japanese corporations without a permanent establishment in Japan (non-resident Holders) who are holders of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation or of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation. The information given below regarding Japanese taxation is based on the tax laws and tax treaties in force and their interpretations by the Japanese tax authorities as of June 24, 2011. Tax laws and tax treaties as well as their interpretations may change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Particularly, investors are advised to refer to any changes that are expected as a result of the 2011 Annual Tax Reform, which was passed by the Diet and is expected to be promulgated as law soon after the above date. Sony Corporation will not update this summary for any changes in the tax laws or tax treaties or their interpretation that occurs after such date. Generally, non-resident Holders are subject to Japanese withholding tax on dividends paid by Japanese corporations. Such taxes are withheld prior to payment of dividends as required by Japanese law. Stock splits are, in general, not a taxable event. In the absence of an applicable tax treaty, convention or agreement reducing the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax or allowing exemption from Japanese withholding tax, the rate of Japanese withholding tax applicable to dividends paid by Japanese corporations to non-resident Holders is generally 20 percent, provided, with respect to dividends paid on listed shares issued by a Japanese corporation (such as the shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation) to non-resident Holders other than any individual shareholder who holds 5 percent or more (or, if the 2011 Annual Tax Reform comes into force, 3 percent or more with respect to dividends due and payable on or after October 1, 2011) of the total shares issued by the relevant Japanese corporation, the aforementioned 20 percent withholding tax rate is reduced to (i) 7 percent for dividends due and payable on or before December 31, 2011 (or, if the 2011 Annual Tax Reform comes into force, December 31, 2013), and (ii) 15 percent for dividends due and payable on or after January 1, 2012 (or, if the 2011 Annual Tax Reform comes into force, January 1, 2014). As of the date of this document, Japan has income tax treaties, conventions or agreements in force, whereby the above-mentioned withholding tax rate is reduced, in most cases to 15 percent or 10 percent for portfolio investors (15 percent under the income tax treaties with, among other countries, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, and 10 percent under the income tax treaties with Australia, France, the U.K. and the United States). 125 Table of Contents Under the Treaty, the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax that may be imposed on dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that does not own directly or indirectly at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the Japanese corporation is generally reduced to 10 percent of the gross amount actually distributed, and dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that is a pension fund are exempt from Japanese income taxation by way of withholding or otherwise unless such dividends are derived from the carrying on of a business, directly or indirectly, by such pension fund. If the maximum tax rate provided for in the income tax treaty applicable to dividends paid by Sony Corporation to any particular non-resident Holder is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law, or if any particular non-resident Holder is exempt from Japanese income tax with respect to such dividends under the income tax treaty applicable to such particular non-resident Holder, such non-resident Holder who is entitled to a reduced rate of or exemption from Japanese withholding tax on payment of dividends on shares of common stock by Sony Corporation is required to submit an Application Form for Income Tax Convention Regarding Relief from Japanese Income Tax on Dividends (together with any other required forms and documents) in advance through the withholding agent to the relevant tax authority before the payment of dividends. A standing proxy for non-resident Holders of a Japanese corporation may provide this application service. With respect to ADSs, this reduced rate or exemption is applicable if the depositary or its agent submits two Application Forms (one before payment of dividends and the other within eight months after the record date concerning such payment of dividends). To claim this reduced rate or exemption, a non-resident Holder of ADSs will be required to file a proof of taxpayer status, residence and beneficial ownership (as applicable) and to provide other information or documents as may be required by the depositary. A non-resident Holder who is entitled, under an applicable income tax treaty, to a reduced rate which is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law or an exemption from the withholding tax, but failed to submit the required application in advance will be entitled to claim the refund of taxes withheld in excess of the rate under an applicable tax treaty (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to a reduced treaty rate under the applicable income tax treaty) or the full amount of tax withheld (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to an exemption under the applicable income tax treaty) from the relevant Japanese tax authority, by complying with a certain subsequent filing procedure. Sony Corporation does not assume any responsibility to ensure withholding at the reduced treaty rate or to ensure not withholding for shareholders who would be so eligible under any applicable income tax treaty but where the required procedures as stated above are not followed. Gains derived from the sale of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation outside Japan by a non-resident Holder holding such shares or ADSs as portfolio investors are, in general, not subject to Japanese income tax or corporation tax under Japanese tax law. U.S. holders are not subject to Japanese income or corporation tax with respect to such gains under the Treaty. Japanese inheritance tax and gift tax at progressive rates may be payable by an individual who has acquired shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation as a legatee, heir or donee even though neither the acquiring individual nor the deceased nor donor is a Japanese resident. Holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of these taxes and, in the case of U.S. holders, the possible application of the Estate and Gift Tax Treaty between the U.S. and Japan. United States Taxation with respect to shares of Common Stock and ADSs The U.S. dollar amount of dividends received (prior to deduction of Japanese taxes) by a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation will be included in income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of Sony Corporation as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by an individual prior to January 1, 2013 with respect to the ADSs or Common Stock will be subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent if the dividends are qualified dividends. Dividends paid on the ADSs or Common Stock will be treated as qualified dividends if Sony Corporation was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). Based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and relevant market and 126 Table of Contents shareholder data, Sony Corporation believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2010 taxable year. In addition, based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and Sony Corporations current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the 2011 taxable year. The U.S. Treasury has announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or Common Stock and intermediaries through whom such securities are held will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to treat dividends as qualified for tax reporting purposes. Because such procedures have not yet been issued, it is not clear whether Sony Corporation will be able to comply with them. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock of Sony Corporation should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of the considerations discussed above and their own particular circumstances. Subject to applicable limitations and special considerations discussed below, a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation will be entitled to a credit for Japanese tax withheld in accordance with the Treaty from dividends paid by Sony Corporation. For purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, dividends will be foreign source income, and will generally constitute passive income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term of hedged positions and may not be allowed in respect of arrangements in which economic profit, after non-U.S. taxes, is insubstantial. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of these rules in light of their particular circumstances. Dividends paid by Sony Corporation to U.S. corporate holders of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In general, a U.S. holder will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or disposition and the U.S. holders tax basis in the ADSs or Common Stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the ADSs or Common Stock have been held for more than one year on the date of the sale or disposition. The net amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder before January 1, 2013 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent. The net long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder after December 31, 2012 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20 percent. Under the Code, a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and possibly backup withholding with respect to dividends and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Common Stock, unless the U.S. holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is not additional tax and may be refunded or credited against the U.S. holders federal income tax liability, so long as the required information is furnished to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Sonys business is continuously exposed to market fluctuation, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates or stock prices. Sony utilizes several derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements in order to hedge the potential downside risk on the cash flow from the normal course of business caused by market fluctuation. Sony uses foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts primarily to reduce the foreign exchange volatility risk that accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in yen, U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies have through the normal course of Sonys worldwide business. Interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements are utilized to diversify funding conditions or to reduce funding costs, and in the Financial Services segment, these transactions are used for asset liability management. Sony uses these derivative financial instruments mainly for risk-hedging purposes as described above, and few derivative transactions, such as bond futures and bond options are held or utilized for trading purposes in the Financial Services segment. If hedge accounting cannot be applied because the accounts receivable or accounts payable to be hedged are not yet booked, or because cash flows from derivative transactions do not coincide with the underlying exposures recorded on Sonys balance sheet, such derivatives agreements are subject to a mark-to-market evaluation and their unrealized gains or losses are recognized in earnings. In addition, Sony holds marketable securities such as straight bonds, convertible bonds, and stocks in yen or other currencies in the Financial Services segment in order to obtain interest income or capital gain on the financial assets under management. Investments in marketable securities are also subject to market fluctuation. Sony measures the economic impact of market fluctuations on the value of derivatives agreements and marketable securities by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis in order to comply with Item 11 disclosure requirements. VaR in this context indicates the potential maximum amount of loss in fair value resulting from adverse market fluctuations for a selected period of time and at a selected level of confidence. The following table shows the results of VaR. These analyses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 indicate the potential maximum loss in fair value as predicted by the VaR analysis resulting from market fluctuations in one day at a 95 percent confidence level. The VaR of currency exchange rate risk principally consists of risks arising from the volatility of the exchange rates between the yen and U.S. dollar and between the yen and the euro, the currencies in which a significant amount of financial assets and liabilities and derivative transactions are maintained on a consolidated basis. The VaR of interest rate risk and stock price risk consists of risks arising from the volatility of the interest rates and stock prices against invested securities and derivatives transactions in the Financial Services segment. The net VaR for Sonys entire portfolio is smaller than the simple aggregate of VaR for each component of market risk. This is due to the fact that market risk factors such as currency exchange rates, interest rates, and stock prices are not completely independent, and potential profits and losses arising from each market risk may to some degree be mutually offsetting. The disclosed VaR amounts simply represent the calculated potential maximum loss on the specified date and does not necessarily indicate an estimate of actual or future loss.

Description of Securities Other Than Equity Securities Item 12(d). American Depositary Shares JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Depositary) serves as the depositary for Sony Corporations ADSs. ADS holders are required to pay various fees to the Depositary and the Depositary may refuse to provide any service for which a fee is assessed until the applicable fee has been paid. The following fees may at any time and from time to time be changed by agreement between Sony Corporation and the Depositary. Under the terms of the depositary agreement, ADS holders are required to pay the Depositary an annual fee of 0.05 U.S. dollar per ADS (or portion thereof) for administering the ADS program, and amounts in respect of expenses incurred by the Depositary or its agents on behalf of ADS holders, except expenses arising from (i) compliance with applicable law, taxes or other governmental charges, (ii) cable, telex or facsimile transmission, (iii) transfer or registration in connection with the deposit or withdrawal of deposited securities, and (iv) conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars. In each case, the fee may be charged on a periodic basis and the Depositary may decide in its sole discretion to seek payment by either billing holders or by deducting the fee from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions. Under the terms of the depositary agreement, ADS holders are required to pay additional fees for certain services provided by the Depositary, as set forth in the table below. Depositary service Fee payable by ADS holders Cash distribution of dividends 0.05 U.S. dollar or less per ADS Transfers of ADRs 1.50 U.S. dollars per ADS ADS holders also may be required to pay additional fees for certain services provided by the Depositary, as set forth in the table below. Depositary service Fee payable by ADS holders Issuance and delivery of ADRs, including in connection with share distributions, sales and stock splits 5.00 U.S. dollars for each 100 ADSs (or portion thereof) Distribution or sale of securities other than ADRs 5.00 U.S. dollars for each 100 shares Withdrawal, cancellation or reduction of shares underlying ADSs 5.00 U.S. dollars per 100 ADSs (or portion thereof) 129 Table of Contents Direct and Indirect Payments by the Depositary to Sony The Depositary reimburses Sony for certain expenses Sony incurs in connection with its ADR program, subject to a ceiling agreed upon by Sony and the Depositary from time to time. These reimbursable expenses currently include legal and accounting fees, listing fees, investor relations expenses and fees payable to service providers for the distribution of material to ADR holders. For the year ended March 31, 2011, such reimbursements totaled approximately 2.1 million U.S. dollars. In addition, as part of its service to Sony, the Depositary waives fees for the standard costs associated with the administration of the ADR program, associated operating expenses, investor relations advice and access to an internet-based tool used in Sonys investor relations activities. For the year ended March 31, 2011, the amount of these indirect payments was estimated to total 0.2 million U.S. dollars. Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies None Item 14.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures Sony has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Sonys management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Sonys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of March 31, 2011. Disclosure controls and procedures require that information to be disclosed in the reports Sony files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Sonys management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon Sonys evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of March 31, 2011, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Item 15(b). Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Sonys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sonys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Sonys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Sony; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Sony are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Sonys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 130 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Sonys management evaluated the effectiveness of Sonys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011 based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the evaluation, management has concluded that Sony maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011. Sonys independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, has issued an audit report on Sonys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, presented on page (F-2). Item 15(c). Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Refer to the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page (F-2). Item 15(d). Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in Sonys internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sonys internal control over financial reporting. Item 16. [Reserved] Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Sonys Board of Directors has determined that Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Kanemitsu Anraku each qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, both are determined to be independent as defined under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Corporate Governance Standards. Item 16B. Code of Ethics Sony has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 16B of Form 20-F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The code of ethics applies to Sonys Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, chief accounting officer and persons performing similar functions, as well as to directors and all other officers and employees of Sony, as defined in the code of ethics. The code of ethics is available at http://www.sony.net/code Item 16C.

(2) Audit-Related Fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services, and primarily include advisory services relating to the implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards, as well as audit services relating to benefit plans and audit services relating to business acquisitions and dispositions. (3) Tax Fees primarily consist of fees for tax advice. (4) All Other Fees comprise fees for all other services not included in any of the other categories noted above. Audit Committees Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures Consistent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding auditor independence, Sony Corporations Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, reviewing and setting compensation, retaining, and overseeing the work of Sonys independent auditor, so that the auditors independence will not be impaired, including overseeing any separate firm that audits the financial statements of any subsidiary if Sonys independent auditor expressly relies on the audit report of such firm. The Audit Committee established a formal policy requiring pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor to Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. The Audit Committee shall periodically review this policy with due regard for compliance with laws and regulations of host countries where Sony Corporation is listed. Prior to the engagement of the independent auditor for the following fiscal years audit, management shall submit an application form to the Audit Committee for comprehensive pre-approval of all recurring services expected to be rendered during that year. In order to obtain comprehensive pre-approval, management shall provide sufficient information regarding each service so that each service can be classified into one of four categories (Audit, Audit-Related, Tax, or All Other) as well as information regarding the fees expected to be budgeted for each service. Management shall describe each service in detail and indicate precisely and unambiguously the nature and scope of each particular service. Any additional services not contemplated in the application form shall require the Audit Committees separate pre-approval on an individual basis. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees, resulting from changes in the scope of services to be provided or from other circumstances. The Audit Committee Chair retains pre-approval authority and evaluates items for approval on a request basis. The Audit Committee or its designee shall establish procedures to assure that the independent auditor is aware in a timely manner of the services that have been pre-approved. Effective April 1, 2010, management shall review the individual services to confirm whether such individual services are within the scope of the comprehensive preapproval. Notwithstanding the comprehensive approval, significant individual services should be submitted to the Audit Committee for further individual approval. Management shall monitor the fees actually paid to the independent auditor and report on these individual services to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis to assure on-going transparency. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the Audit Committee continued, as a matter of Sonys policy, to generally exclude individual tax services and corporate tax services from the list of permissible services to enhance auditor independence. The Audit Committee carefully reviewed these services and only permitted exceptional instances, which were not prohibited under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These exceptions were only allowed in situations in which difficulties were encountered in finding an alternative service provider immediately, or when a transitional period was needed. Item 16D.

Disclosure About Differences in Corporate Governance The table below discloses the significant ways in which Sonys corporate governance practices differ from those required for U.S. companies under the listing standards of the NYSE. As a foreign private issuer listed on the NYSE, Sony is exempt from most of the exchanges corporate governance standards requirements. For further information on Sonys corporate governance practices and history, please refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Director, Senior Management and Employees. In the table below, any reference to Sony shall mean Sony Corporation. NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices Board Independence. A majority of board directors must be independent. Sony has adopted the Company with Committees system under the Companies Act. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors (attached as an exhibit 1.3 to this report) requires its board to consist of between 10 to 20 directors. The Companies Act does not require Sony to have a majority of independent (in the meaning given by the 133 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices NYSE Corporate Governance Standards) directors on its board; rather, it requires Sony to have a majority of outside directors (the definition of the term outside director is summarized below) on each of three statutory committees (the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee). In addition, the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange require Sony to have, at least one Independent Director on the Board of Directors. Independent Director is defined in the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as an outside director who is unlikely to have conflicts of interest with shareholders. As of June 28, 2011, 13 of the 15 members of Sonys Board of Directors are qualified as outside directors. In addition, all 13 outside directors are also qualified and designated as Independent Directors under the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Director Independence. A director is not independent if such director is (i) a person who the board determines has a material direct or indirect relationship with the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary; (ii) a person who, within the last three years, has been an employee of the company or has an immediate family member of an executive officer of the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary; (iii) a person who had received, or whose immediate family member had received, during any 12 month period within the last three years, more than 120,000 U.S dollars per year in direct compensation from the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary, other than director and committee fees or deferred compensation for prior services (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); (iv) (A) a person who is, or whose immediate family member is, a current partner or employee of a firm that is the companys internal or external auditor; (B) a person whose immediate family member is a partner of such a firm; (C) a person who has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who personally participates in the firms audit, assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (D) a person who was, or has an immediate family member who was, within the last three years, a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the listed companys audit within Outside director is defined in the Companies Act as: A director (i) who is not a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or a general manager or other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who has never been a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or a general manager or other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries. Under the Companies Act, a directors status as an outside director is unaffected by the directors compensation, his or her affiliation with business partners, or the boards affirmative determination of independence. On the other hand, under the Companies Act, a director who has had a career as a management director, corporate executive officer, or other employee of the company or its subsidiaries is by definition not an outside director. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors includes a provision requiring that each outside director: Shall not have received directly from Sony Group, during any consecutive 12 month period within the last three years, more than an amount equivalent to 120,000 U.S dollars, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such 134 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices that time; (v) a person who is, or whose immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the listed companys present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that companys compensation committee; or (vi) an executive officer or employee of a company, or has an immediate family member of an executive officer of a company, that makes payments to, or receives payments from, the listed company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of 1 million U.S. dollars or 2 percent of such other companys consolidated gross revenues compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); (ii) Shall not be a director, a statutory auditor, a corporate executive officer, a general manager or other employees of any company whose aggregate amount of transactions with Sony Group, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of an amount equivalent to 1,000,000 U.S. dollars, or 2 percent of the annual consolidated sales of such company; and (iii) Shall not be, or shall not have been, a director engaged in the business operation, a corporate executive officer, an accounting counselor, a general manager or other employees of Sony or its subsidiaries*. (* This provision of the Charter is based on the definition of outside director under the Companies Act.) In addition, the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange requires Sony to have, at least one Independent Director on the Board of Directors. Independent Director is defined in the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as an officer who is unlikely to have conflicts of interest with shareholders. As of June 28, 2011, 13 of the 15 members of Sonys Board of Directors qualified as outside directors. In addition, all those 13 outside directors are qualified and designated as Independent Directors under the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Executive Sessions. Non-management directors must meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. Independent directors should meet alone in an executive session at least once a year. An outside director, as defined under the Companies Act, is equivalent to a non-management director under the NYSE rules because an outside director does not engage in the execution of business operations of the company. Neither the Companies Act nor Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors requires non-management directors to meet regularly without management and nothing requires outside directors to meet alone in an executive session at least once a year. Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. A nominating/corporate governance committee of independent directors is required. The committee must have a charter that addresses the purpose, responsibilities (including development of corporate governance guidelines) and annual performance evaluation of the committee. Sonys Nominating Committee consists of at least five directors. Under the Companies Act, the Committee is responsible for determining the contents of proposals regarding the appointment and dismissal of directors to be submitted for approval to the shareholders meeting. Unlike listed U.S. companies under NYSE rules, it is not responsible for developing governance guidelines or overseeing the evaluation of the board and 135 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices management. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under the Companies Act. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors requires at least two of the directors on the Committee to be corporate executive officers. Compensation Committee. A compensation committee of independent directors is required. The committee must have a charter that addresses the purpose, responsibilities and annual performance evaluation of the committee. Sonys Compensation Committee consists of at least three directors. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under the Companies Act. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors recommends that at least one of the directors on the Committee be a corporate executive officer. The Charter prohibits the CEO and/or the COO (or a person at any equivalent position) from serving on the Compensation Committee. Under the Companies Act, the Committee is responsible for, among others, determining the compensation of each director and corporate executive officer. Audit Committee. An audit committee satisfying the independence and other requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The committee must have at least three members. All members must be independent. The committee must have a charter addressing the committees purpose, an annual performance evaluation of the committee and the duties and responsibilities of the committee. Sonys Audit Committee consists of at least three directors. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under the Companies Act. In addition, pursuant to the Companies Act, no member of the Committee shall be a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors also requires each member of the Audit Committee to meet the independence requirements of the applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations, and requires at least one member to meet the audit committee financial expert requirements. Currently, all the members of Sonys Audit Committee are also independent as defined in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards, and two members of the Committee are qualified as audit committee financial experts. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors discourages any Audit Committee member from concurrently being a member of other Committees. Equity Compensation Plans. Equity compensation plans require shareholder approval, subject to limited exemptions. Under the Companies Act, if Sony wishes to adopt an equity compensation plan under which stock acquisition rights are granted on specially favorable conditions, except where all of its shareholders are granted rights to subscribe for such stock acquisition 136 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices rights or such stock acquisition rights are gratuitously allocated to all of its shareholders, each on a pro rata basis, then Sony must obtain shareholder approval by a special resolution of a general meeting of shareholders, where the quorum is one-third of the total number of voting rights of all of its shareholders and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required under Sonys Articles of Incorporation. Corporate Governance Guidelines. Corporate governance guidelines must be adopted and disclosed. Sony is required to disclose the status of its corporate governance under the Companies Act and the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange; however, Sony does not have corporate governance guidelines that cover all the requirements described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards, as many of the provisions do not apply to Sony. Details of the status are posted on the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/control.html Code of Ethics. A code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees must be adopted and disclosed, along with any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. Although this provision of the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards does not apply to Sony, Sony has adopted a code of conduct to be observed by all its directors, officers and other employees. The code of conduct is available at http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/management/ compliance/code_of_conduct.pdf The codes content covers principal items described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards. 137 Table of Contents Item 17.
