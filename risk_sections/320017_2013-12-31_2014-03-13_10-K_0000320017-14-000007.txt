ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. The risks described below are not the only ones we face, but those we currently consider to be material. There may be other risks which we now consider immaterial, or which are unknown or unpredictable, with respect to our business, our competition, the regulatory environment or otherwise that could have a material adverse effect on our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITIONWe anticipate that we will need substantial additional financing in the future to continue our operations; if we are unable to raise additional capital, as and when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our product development programs, or expansion of our contract development and manufacturing operations and our business will be harmed. Our current operating plan will require significant levels of additional capital to fund, among other things, the continued development of our cell therapy product candidates and the operation, enhancement and expansion of our contract development and manufacturing operations to support our customers and our clinical development activities. Our research and development expenses increased significantly over the past two years as a result of the initiation of the AMR-001 Phase 2 clinical trial in 2012. This trial completed enrollment in December 2013. Research and development expenses also have been increasing with respect to our T Regulatory Cell Program, particularly due to the licensing of patents, data and collaboration with third parties. The Company's clinical activities are expected to continue to grow as AMR-001 is developed for AMI and other clinical trials for indications are launched under our CD34 Cell Program and T Regulatory Cell Program. These programs will require significant investment over a period of several years before they could be approved by FDA and commercialized by us, if ever. If the results of the current Phase 2 and other clinical trials are positive, we will need to conduct additional clinical studies of the product, including larger and more expensive pivotal Phase 3 studies. To do so, we will need to raise additional money in the capital markets, enter into collaboration agreements with third parties or undertake some combination thereof. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we will likely need to otherwise delay or abandon the trials. The amount and timing of our future capital requirements also will likely depend on many other factors, including:•the scope, progress, results, costs, timing and outcomes of our other cell therapy research and development programs and product candidates;•our ability to enter into any collaboration agreements with third parties for our other product candidates and the timing and terms of any such agreements; •the costs associated with the consummation of one or more strategic transactions;•the timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, a process which could be particularly lengthy or complex given the FDA's limited experience with marketing approval for cell therapy products; •the costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities; and•the cost of expansion of our contract development and manufacturing operations, including but not limited to the costs of expanded facilities, equipment costs, engineering and innovation initiatives and personnel.To both fund our clinical studies and support our future operations, we would likely seek to raise capital through a variety of different public and/or private financings vehicles. This could include, but not be limited to, use of our common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital, as described below, potential warrant exercises, option exercises, issuances of other debt or equity securities in public or private financings, and/or sale of assets. If we raise capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, it would result in dilution to our then existing stockholders. Servicing the interest and principal repayment obligations under debt facilities could divert funds that would otherwise be available to support research and development, clinical or commercialization activities. In certain cases, we also may seek funding through collaborative arrangements, that would likely require us to relinquish certain rights to our technology or product candidates and share in the future revenues associated with the partnered product. Ultimately, we may be unable to raise capital to enter into collaborative relationships on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. Our inability to obtain necessary capital or financing to fund our future operating needs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 28IndexWe have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations in the past, and expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future.We have a limited operating history, limited capital, and limited sources of revenue. Since our inception in 1980 through December 31, 2013, we have incurred aggregate net losses of approximately $236.4 million. Our net losses attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were approximately $39.0 million and $55.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were $46.1 million. The revenues generated in our cell therapy services business have not been, and are not expected in the foreseeable future to be, sufficient to cover costs attributable to that business or to our operations as a whole, including our development activities associated with our product candidates. Ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenue from our cell therapy services business for us to reach profitability, generate positive cash flow or sustain, on an ongoing basis, our current or projected levels of product development and other operations. Our stock price has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile. The market price of our common stock has been and in the future may continue to be highly volatile. For example, from January 1, 2013 through March 11, 2014 our common stock traded as low as $5.00 per share and as high as $9.89 per share; in 2012, our common stock traded as low as $3.00 per share and as high as $9.00 per share. The market price for our common stock is highly dependent on, among other things, our clinical development efforts the profitability and growth of our cell therapy services business and the growth of our business in general, the amount of our available cash and investments and our level of cash utilization. Future events could increase the volatility seen in our common stock and ultimately cause a significant decline in the price of our common stock and ultimately impact our ability to raise additional capital in the future. These events could include the following, among others:•low levels of trading volume for our shares;•capital-raising or other transactions that are, or may in the future be, dilutive to existing stockholders or that involve the issuance of debt securities;•delays in our clinical trials, negative clinical trial results or adverse regulatory decisions relating to our product candidates; •adverse fluctuations in our revenues or operating results or financial results that otherwise fall below the market's expectations;•disappointing developments concerning our cell therapy services clients or other collaborators for our product candidates; and•legal challenges, disputes and/or other adverse developments impacting our patents or other proprietary rights that protect our products.In addition, broader external events, such as news concerning economic or market conditions in the general economy or within our industry, the activities of our competitors, changes (or the threat of changes) in U.S. or foreign government regulations impacting the life sciences industry or the movement of capital into or out of our industry, are likely to affect the price of our Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not continue to fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition to potential dilution associated with future fundraising transactions, we currently have significant numbers of securities outstanding that are exercisable for our Common Stock, which could result in significant additional dilution and downward pressure on our stock price. As of December 31, 2013, there were 27,196,537 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. In addition, there were outstanding stock options and warrants representing the potential issuance of an additional 7,830,457 shares of our Common Stock. The issuance of these shares in the future would result in significant dilution to our current stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and the terms on which we could raise additional capital. In addition, the issuance and subsequent trading of shares could cause the supply of our Common Stock available for purchase in the market to exceed the purchase demand for our Common Stock. Such supply in excess of demand could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. Sales of our Common Stock to Aspire Capital pursuant to our Purchase Agreement may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and the sale of the shares of Common Stock acquired by Aspire Capital could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline. The Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC in March 2014, pursuant to which Aspire Capital committed to the purchase of up to $30 million of shares of the Company’s Common Stock over the term of that Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions. 29IndexPursuant to the agreement, after Aspire Capital acquires shares under the Purchase Agreement, it may sell all or some of those shares. Sales to Aspire Capital by us pursuant to the Purchase Agreement may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Aspire Capital and the Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us.Actual and beneficial ownership of large quantities of our Common Stock by our executive officers and directors may substantially reduce the influence of other stockholders. As of December 31, 2013, our executive officers and directors owned, of record and beneficially, an aggregate of approximately 11.41% and 16.86%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. As a result, such persons may have the ability to exercise enhanced control and influence over the approval process for actions that require stockholder approval, including the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other significant corporate transactions or other matters submitted for stockholder approval. Furthermore, at certain times the interests of our substantial stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. During the course of testing our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may identify and disclose material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that will have to be remedied. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal control may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain that adequacy or inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could result in our financial statements being unreliable, increase our operating costs and materially impair our ability to operate our business. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Additionally, failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could result in government investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities.Compliance with public company obligations, including the securities laws and regulations, is costly and requires significant management resources, and we may fail to comply. We are now an “accelerated filer,” and beginning with our Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2014 will no longer qualify to report under smaller reporting company disclosure rules, and as a result will be subject to more comprehensive disclosure obligations, with increased compliance costs.The federal securities laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting. Because the aggregate market value of our public float was in excess of $75 million as of June 30, 2013, we became an “accelerated filer” as of the end of our 2013 fiscal year. As a result, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements is now required to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The auditor attestation requirement applies to us for the first time with respect to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, beginning with our Form 10-Q for our first quarter of fiscal 2014, we will be required to satisfy all of the larger reporting company disclosure requirements. These requirements will increase our legal compliance obligations and costs, which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations. Relatively speaking, we are a small company with limited resources. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the added “accelerated filer” requirements by applicable deadlines and to maintain compliance in the future. If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting. 30IndexRISKS RELATED TO OUR CELL THERAPY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTSOur future success is dependent on the timely and successful development and commercialization of our CD34 Cell Program and T Regulatory Cell Program product candidates, and if we encounter delays or difficulties in the development of these product candidates, our business prospects would be significantly harmed.We are dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates which are in an early stages of development. Before we are able to seek regulatory approval, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. With infusion of the target population of 160 patients complete, the last patient primary endpoint follow-up for this study is expected in June 2014 followed by data lock and analysis with a submission for a possible presentation of the study at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions to be held November 15-19, 2014. We also expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for chronic heart failure in Europe in 2014 and are conducting preclinical studies in traumatic brain injury for which we expect data in 2014. In 2014, we expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in type 1 diabetes with Tregs; we also plan to initiate a Phase 1 study in Canada of Treg based therapeutics in support of a steroid resistant asthma indication in 2014. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. Importantly, a failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to complete our clinical studies, receive regulatory approval or commercialize our CD34 Cell Program and T Regulatory Cell Program product candidates, including the following: suspensions, delays or changes in the design, initiation, enrollment, implementation or completion of required clinical trials; adverse changes in our financial position or significant and unexpected increases in the cost of our clinical development program; changes or uncertainties in, or additions to, the regulatory approval process that require us to alter our current development strategy; clinical trial results that are negative, inconclusive or even less than desired as to safety and/or efficacy, which could result in the need for additional clinical studies or the termination of the product's development; and delays in the ability to manufacture the product in quantities or in a form that is suitable for any required clinical trials; intellectual property constraints that prevent us from making, using, or commercializing any of our CD34 Cell Program or T Regulatory Cell Program product candidates; and the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of these product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.During our Phase 1 trial of AMR-001 for post AMI patients, serious adverse events occurred in subjects treated with AMR-001. To date, in our Phase 2 trial of AMR-001 for post AMI patients, serious adverse events occurred which may or may not have been in the group of subjects treated with AMR-001 (which we will be able to confirm once the study is unblinded). There can be no assurance that similar or other additional events will not occur in the Phase 2 or any other future clinical trials, particularly, for AMR-001, in light of the impaired heart function of patients who will be the target subject population of AMR-001. No concerns have been articulated by the Data Safety Monitoring Board ("DSMB"), a group charged with looking at unblinded results during the course of the study and they recommended continuing our PreServe AMI Phase 2 clinical trial.Even if we are able to successfully complete our clinical development program for our product candidates, including AMR-001, and ultimately receive regulatory approval to market the product, we may, among other things: obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as the indications we sought; have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval; encounter issues with respect to the manufacturing of commercial supplies; be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; and/or be subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used.We may experience delays in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.We may not be able to initiate or complete as planned any clinical trials if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. For example, 31Indexwe had originally expected to complete enrollment for the PreSERVE AMI Phase 2 trial of AMR-001 earlier than its December 2013 completion. We also may be unable to engage a sufficient number of clinical trial sites to conduct our trials. The challenge of enrolling patients will become more difficult if we are required by the FDA or a similar regulatory agency outside the United States to conduct a trial on a larger population than we currently anticipate. In that event, we might be required to seek patients to participate in our trials from Europe or other foreign jurisdictions, which could raise regulatory uncertainties and increase clinical trial costs. Moreover, because PCT does not currently have manufacturing facilities operating outside of the United States, our ability to conduct trials outside of the U.S. may be constrained by our ability to transport trial materials to foreign destinations within the expiry period of such materials unless, and until we commence operation outside of the United States or find another source of supply.We may face challenges in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical trials due to the novelty of our cell-based therapies, the size of the patient populations and the eligibility criteria for enrollment in the trial. In addition, some patients may have concerns regarding cell therapy that may negatively affect their perception of therapies under development and their decision to enroll in the trials. Furthermore, patients suffering from diseases within target indications may enroll in competing clinical trials, which could negatively affect our ability to complete enrollment of our trials. Enrollment challenges in clinical trials often result in increased development costs for a product candidate, significant delays and potentially the abandonment of the clinical trial.The development of our cell therapy product candidates are subject to uncertainty because autologous cell therapy is inherently variable.When manufacturing an autologous cell therapy, the number and the composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale. As a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for autologous cell therapy products could be delayed or may never be completed.Any disruption to our access to the reagents we are using in the clinical development of our cell therapy product candidates could adversely affect our ability to perform clinical trials and seek future regulatory submissions. Reagents, devices, materials and systems that we are using in our clinical trials, that we intend to use in our planned clinical trials and that we may need or use in commercial production, are provided by unaffiliated third parties. Any lack of continued availability of these reagents, devices, materials and systems for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete these studies and could adversely impact our ability to achieve commercial manufacture of our planned therapeutic products. Although other available sources for these reagents, devices, materials and systems may exist in the marketplace, we have not evaluated their cost, effectiveness, or intellectual property foundation and therefore cannot guaranty the suitability or availability of such other potential sources. The initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for AMR-001 or any other cell therapy product candidate will require the validation and establishment of manufacturing controls that may delay the products' development timeline.If the results of our current and planned Phase 2 clinical trials are positive and support Phase 3 development, we expect to initiate and complete one or more pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. To do so, we are required to have certain validated and established manufacturing controls with respect to the safety, purity and potency of our product when administered to patients. We may not be successful in our efforts to address any chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, issues raised by the FDA. If we cannot initiate, or if we are delayed in initiating, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical program as a result of our failure to satisfy the FDA's CMC concerns or otherwise, the timing of our planned regulatory submission for commercialization of our product candidates would be delayed, or we may be unable to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our products at all.32IndexWe presently lack sufficient manufacturing capabilities to produce our CD34 Cell Program and T Regulatory Cell Program product candidates at commercial scale quantities and do not have an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the product.Currently, PCT exclusively provides the cell processing services necessary for clinical production of AMR-001 and will provide the cell processing services for our planned T Regulatory Cell Program clinical trials in type 1 diabetes and asthma and CD34 Cell Program in chronic heart failure. PCT also provides services and produces materials for clinical trials on behalf of unaffiliated third parties. To date, PCT has not produced any products at commercial scale quantities. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential commercial demand for AMR-001, our other CD34 Cell Program and T Regulatory Cell Program product candidates, if approved, as well as any of our other product candidates that might attain regulatory approval. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. Even if we increase our manufacturing capabilities, it is possible that we may still lack sufficient capacity to meet demand. Ultimately, if we are unable to supply our products to meet commercial demand, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, sales of the products and their long term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.We do not presently have any alternate supply for AMR-001 or other CD34 Cell Program our T Regulatory Cell Program product candidates. If our facility where these product candidates are currently being manufactured or equipment were significantly damaged or destroyed, or if there were other disruptions, delays or difficulties affecting manufacturing capacity, our planned and future clinical studies and commercial production for these product candidates would likely be significantly disrupted and delayed. It would be both time consuming and expensive to replace this capacity with third parties, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the regulatory requirements. Ultimately, if we are unable to supply our cell product candidates to meet commercial demand, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, our production costs could dramatically increase and sales of the product and its long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged. The commercial potential and profitability of our products is unknown and subject to significant risk and uncertainty.Even if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our cell therapy product candidates, the market may not understand or accept the product, which could adversely affect both the timing and level of future sales. Ultimately, the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates (or any of our future product candidates) will depend on a number of factors, including: the clinical effectiveness, safety and convenience of the product particularly in relation to alternative treatments; our ability to distinguish our products from any ethical and political controversies associated with stem cell products derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue; and the cost of the product, the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.Even if we are successful in achieving sales of our product candidates consistent with our expectations, it is not clear to what extent, if any, the products will be profitable. The costs of goods associated with production of cell therapy products are significant. While we are working to improve the speed and efficiency and lower the cost of our manufacturing processes, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. In addition, some changes in manufacturing processes or procedures generally require FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval prior to implementation. We may need to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates.We have limited experience in the development and marketing of cell therapies and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to establish a profitable business. Over the past three years, we shifted our business plan entirely to focus on capturing a piece of the burgeoning field of cell therapy. Despite being in business for over eight years, we have limited experience in the areas of cell therapy product development and marketing, and in the related regulatory issues and processes. While PCT currently provides services in connection with our development activities as a third party contractor, we cannot assure you that our management will successfully oversee our clinical development efforts and our plans to capture a piece of the cell therapy market.33IndexOur cell therapy business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive, risky and may not be understood by or accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our future value.The clinical development, commercialization and marketing of cell and tissue-based therapies is at an early-stage, substantially research-oriented, and financially speculative. To date, very few companies have been successful in their efforts to develop and commercialize a stem cell product. In general, stem cell products may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy, or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. Furthermore, the number of people who may use cell or tissue-based therapies is difficult to forecast with accuracy. Our future success is dependent on the establishment of a large global market for cell- and tissue-based therapies and our ability to capture a share of this market with our product candidates.Our development efforts with our cell therapy product candidates are susceptible to the same risks of failure inherent in the development and commercialization of therapeutic products based on new technologies. The novel nature of cellular therapeutics creates significant challenges in the areas of product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance. For example, the United States FDA has relatively limited experience regulating therapies based on cells, and there are few approved treatments utilizing cell therapy.If we are unable or unsuccessful in our efforts to discover or license, develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates, our long-term prospects will be negatively impacted. Our product candidates require governmental approvals prior to commercialization. We face the substantial risks of failure inherent in developing cell-based therapies. Our product candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will approve them for commercial use. There can be no assurance that these standards will remain consistent over time, further complicating our ability to obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates. To satisfy these standards, we will need to conduct significant additional research, preclinical testing and clinical trials.Preclinical testing and clinical development are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes; most product candidates are never approved for commercial use. Failure can occur at any stage of testing. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful or sufficient for regulatory approval. Based on results at any stage of clinical trials, we may decide to discontinue development of our product candidates. Even if we obtain approval and begin marketing a product, ongoing clinical trials, including for other indications, may result in additional information that could affect our ability or decision to continue marketing the product. Even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we must comply with applicable FDA post-marketing regulations governing manufacturing, promotion, labeling, risk management and reporting of adverse events and other information, as well as other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could subject us to criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, withdrawal of marketing approval, total or partial suspension of production or injunction, as well as other regulatory actions against our product or us.We have limited resources with which to conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies, which may limit or delay our ability to discover new products or develop our product candidates and increase the risk that our long-term business objectives will not be met. While we also seek to obtain government grants and other funding to further our research and development activities, there is no assurance that such monies will be available to us in the future. Without sufficient funding, we may have to significantly reduce the levels of such expenditures. Despite our limited resources, we intend to explore opportunities to expand our product portfolio by acquiring or in-licensing product candidates. Although we conduct extensive evaluations of product candidate opportunities as part of our due diligence efforts, there can be no assurance that our development efforts for such products will be successful or that we will not become aware of issues or complications that will cause us to alter, delay or terminate these efforts.We rely on third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials and those third parties may fail to perform as expected, which could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for or commercializing AMR-001 or other products. 34IndexWe rely on third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct and oversee our current Phase 2 PreSERVE AMI clinical trial and expect to engage a CRO for our planned clinical trials. We also rely upon various medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and all applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s good clinical practice regulations. These CROs play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials. We rely heavily on these parties for the execution of our clinical and preclinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA’s current good clinical practices requirements, or cGCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with cGCPs. If our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, our clinical trials may be delayed or we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Our CROs are not our employees, and we are not able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize AMR-001 or our other product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for AMR-001 or our other products would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. We may rely on third parties to help us develop or commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to commercialize such candidates may be impaired or delayed if our collaborations are unsuccessful.We may selectively pursue strategic collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates in the United States or abroad, which may require us to share any future profits or revenues, issue our equity securities or transfer certain other material rights. We anticipate that we may need to enter into a collaboration agreement with one or more third parties to conduct and fund Phase 3 clinical trials and to commercialize the products, if approved. Despite our efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable collaborators or negotiate collaboration agreements on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. In any future third-party collaboration, we would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation. Such collaborators may not cooperate or perform their obligations under their agreements with us. We may be unable to control the amount and timing of our collaborators' resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under their agreements with us. Collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements. Disputes with collaborators also could result in product development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.Contractual arrangements with licensors or collaborators may require us to pay royalties or make other payments related to the development of a product candidate, which would adversely affect the level of our future revenues and profits.Even if we obtain all applicable regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize one or more of our cell therapy product candidates, contractual arrangements between us and a licensor, collaborator or other third party in connection with the respective product may require that we make royalty or other payments to the respective third party, and as a result we would not receive all of the revenue derived from commercial sales of such product. Under the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Amorcyte, we are required to pay to the former Amorcyte shareholders certain earn-out payments following the first commercial sale of AMR-001, generally equal to 10% of net sales (or 30% of any sublicensing fees, royalties and milestone fees or profit sharing payments), less our out-of-pocket clinical development costs not previously paid or reimbursed and other expenses. Also, our license agreements relating to our T Regulatory Cell Program therapeutic product candidates include obligations to pay royalties on net sales of licensed products, maintenance fees and milestone fees upon events such as initiation of clinical trial stages, license application filings and regulatory approvals. 35IndexEven if we are successful in developing a therapeutic application using our cell technologies, it is unclear whether cell therapy can serve as the foundation for a commercially viable and profitable business.The cell therapy industry is rapidly developing and could undergo significant change in the future. Such rapid technological development could result in our technologies becoming obsolete. While we believe our cell therapy programs are promising, such technologies may fail to be successfully commercialized for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, competing technologies for the same indication. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop a commercially successful therapeutic application for any potential cell therapy technologies. Moreover, advances in other treatment methods or in disease prevention techniques could significantly reduce or entirely eliminate the need for our cell therapy services, planned products and therapeutic efforts. There is no assurance that cell therapies will achieve the degree of success envisioned by us in the treatment of disease. Additionally, technological or medical developments may materially alter the commercial viability of our technology or services, and require us to incur significant costs to replace or modify equipment in which we have a substantial investment. We are focused on cell therapy, and if this field is substantially unsuccessful, this could jeopardize our success or future results.If we are unsuccessful in building or contracting for commercial sales and marketing capabilities in the United States and abroad, our revenues from any future products will be adversely affected. We currently have no capabilities or experience in the selling, marketing or commercial distribution of cell therapy products. If any of our product candidates are ultimately approved for marketing, we would need to hire and develop an internal sales and marketing organization and/or outsource these functions to one or more third parties.We may be unable to establish sufficient marketing, sales and distribution capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize and gain market acceptance for any of our product candidates. In addition, co-promotion or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize product candidates could significantly limit the revenues we recognize from such product candidates, and these third parties may fail to commercialize the product candidates successfully.If competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer, or less expensive than our product candidates or offer other advantages, our commercial prospects will be limited.Our cell therapy development programs now face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding, both in the United States and abroad. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of drugs and other therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting with our product candidates.Because AMR-001 generally targets patients without other revascularization options, we do not believe it will compete directly with pharmaceutical therapies being developed to treat less severe stages of our target indications. However, to the extent that therapies are developed that reverse the progression of the ischemic damage or improve blood flow to damaged tissue, they could have the effect of reducing demand for our product. In addition, because AMR-001 requires the removal of bone marrow from the patient, potential competing products offering efficacious alternatives through a less invasive procedure may have a competitive advantage in terms of patient appeal. New pharmaceutical agents or devices that improve the repair of cardiac injury after a heart attack, with the result that fewer patients develop ischemic heart failure, would also represent a competitive threat for AMR-001. Furthermore, cell-based therapies, such as cardiac derived cells, bone marrow-derived stem cells and adipose cells are being pursued by companies such as Cardio3, Capricor, Mesoblast, Aastrom Biosciences, Inc., Angioblast Systems, Inc., Athersys, Inc., Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc., ReNeuron Group, Stemedica Cell Technologies Inc. and Bioheart, Inc. Some other companies, such as Cytori and Miltenyi, are developing medical devices to facilitate the production of therapeutic cell populations by clinicians for the treatment of AMR-001's target indications. Such devices may be approved by the FDA under a less rigorous regulatory process, and less extensive clinical testing and manufacturing controls than we are required to pursue for AMR-001 and thus could reach the market well before AMR-001.As a general matter, we also face competition from many other companies that are researching and developing cell therapies. Many of these companies have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience in testing pharmaceutical and other therapeutic products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and marketing and selling. If we ultimately obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we also will be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or 36Indexno commercial-scale experience. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in resources being even more concentrated by our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of our technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields.The same factors and competitors above could also impact the commercial prospects for our cell therapy for congestive heart failure. In addition new heart failure devices such as left ventricular assist devices are being advanced that may result in a degree of cardiac repair that obviates the need for cell therapy.Our T regulatory cell therapy product candidate for recent onset type 1 diabetes and steroid resistant asthma faces competition from other immunomodulatory drugs being developed for other autoimmune diseases as well from other cellular therapies that fall outside of the coverage of our intellectual property. If these therapies are easier to manufacture and have similar safety and efficacy profiles the commercial prospects of our T regulatory cell therapy may be limited. We may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, processing and marketing of cell therapy products. Such liability claims may be expensive to defend and result in large judgments against us. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our current and any future product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk with respect to any commercial sales of our products should they be approved. No product candidate has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore safety data is limited. Cell therapy companies derive the raw materials for manufacturing of product candidates from human cell sources, and therefore the manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims. We presently have product liability insurance limited to $5 million per incident and $5 million in annual aggregate. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin commercializing product candidates, if ever. At that time, we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our financial position could be significantly impaired.Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation that may arise, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, decreased demand for our products and injure our reputation.We seek to maintain errors and omissions, directors and officers, workers' compensation and other insurance at levels we believe to be appropriate to our business activities. If, however, we were subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim from our own limited resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business. Additionally, liability or alleged liability could harm our business by diverting the attention and resources of our management and damaging our reputation.We may be unable to retain key officers or employees or hire new key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop our products and businesses.Given the specialized nature of cell therapy and that it is a relatively new field, there is an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field. We are substantially dependent on the skills and efforts of current senior management for their management and operations, as well as for the implementation of our business strategy. In addition, our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel (including medical, scientific, technical, commercial, business and administrative personnel) necessary to support our anticipated growth, develop our business, perform our contractual obligations to third parties and maintain appropriate licensure. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining personnel required by us to continue to grow our operations. The loss of a key employee, the failure of a key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and/or retain skilled employees, as needed, could result in our inability to continue to grow our business or to implement our business strategy, or may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING BUSINESSCell therapy is in its early stages, it is still a developing field and a significant global market for our third party manufacturing services at PCT may never emerge. 37IndexCell therapy is in its early stages and is still a developing area of research, with few cell therapy products approved for clinical use. Many of the existing cellular therapy candidates are based on novel cell technologies that are inherently risky and may not be understood or accepted by the marketplace, making difficult their own funding to enable them to continue their business. At PCT, the current market and our existing contracts principally consist of providing consulting and manufacturing of cell and tissue-based therapeutic products in clinical trials and processing of stem cell products for transplantation programs. The number of people who may use cell or tissue-based therapies and thus the demand for stem cell processing services is difficult to forecast. If cell therapies under development by us or by others to treat disease are not proven effective, demonstrate unacceptable risks or side effects or, where required, fail to receive regulatory approval, our PCT business will be significantly impaired. While the therapeutic application of cells to treat serious diseases is currently being explored by a number of companies, to date there are only a handful of approved products in the United States. Ultimately, our success in developing our contract development and manufacturing business depends on the development and growth of a broad and profitable global market for cell- and tissue-based therapies and services and our ability to capture a share of this market through PCT. PCT's revenues may vary dramatically from period to period making it difficult to forecast future results. The nature and duration of PCT's contracts with customers often involve regular renegotiation of the scope, level and price of the services we are providing. If our customers reduce the level of their spending on research and development or marketing or are unsuccessful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions, reimbursement issues or other factors, our results of operations may be materially impacted. In addition, other factors, including the rate of enrollment for clinical studies, will directly impact the level and timing of the products and services we deliver. As such, the levels of our revenues and profitability can fluctuate significantly from one period to another and it can be difficult to forecast the level of future revenues with any certainty. We have a finite manufacturing capacity at PCT, which could inhibit the long-term growth prospects of this business.We currently provide services and produce materials for clinical trials at our existing manufacturing facilities in Allendale, New Jersey and Mountain View, California, which we have designed and operated to be compliant with FDA cGMP, and cGTP requirements. While we believe these facilities provide us with sufficient capacity to meet our expected near term demand, it is possible that the demand for our services and products could exceed our existing manufacturing capacity. It may become necessary or desirable for us to expand our manufacturing capabilities for cell therapy services and products in the future, which may require us to invest significant amounts of capital and to obtain regulatory approvals. In this regard, we are reviewing opportunities for expansion to both commercial level and international manufacturing capabilities. If we are unable to meet rising demand for products and services on a timely basis or unable to maintain cGMP compliance standards, then it is likely that our clients and potential clients will elect to obtain the products and services from competitors, which could materially and adversely affect the level of our revenues and our prospects for growth.Components of therapeutic products approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Manufacturers of cell-based product candidates such as AMR-001 and Tregs also must comply with the cGTP. In addition, therapeutic products may be required to modify their manufacturing process from time to time in response to FDA requests. Manufacture of live cellular-based products is complex and subjects companies to significant regulatory burdens that may change over time. We may encounter difficulties in the production of our product candidates due to our limited manufacturing experience. We will need to improve manufacturing efficiency at PCT if we are to realize meaningful gains in PCT's profitability.Together with our customers, PCT is working to improve the efficiency of cell therapy product development for our own product pipeline as well as our clients through the development of engineering and innovation solutions for the cost of goods sold and the profitability of the business. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to develop process enhancements that are acceptable to the FDA, on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any expected improvement in profitability will be realized. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to develop these improvements, we may be unable to profitably operate the PCT business and could face significantly higher capital expenditures, increased facility and personnel costs and other increased operating expenses. We have a limited marketing staff and budget for our PCT operations, which could limit our ability to grow this business.The degree of market acceptance of our products and services depends upon a number of factors, including the strength of our sales and marketing support. If our marketing is not effective, our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired. The newness of the industry and capital constraints provide challenges to our marketing and sales activities at PC, and the failure to attract a sufficient base of customers will affect our ability to increase our revenues and operate profitably.38IndexThe logistics associated with the distribution of materials produced by PCT for third parties and for us are significant, complex and expensive and may negatively impact our ability to generate and meet future demand for our products and improve profitability.Current cell therapy products and product candidates, including our own, have a limited shelf life, in certain instances limited to less than 12 hours. Thus, it is necessary to minimize the amount of time between when the cell product is extracted from a patient, arrives at one of our facilities for processing, and is returned for infusion in the patient. To do so, we need our cell therapy facilities to be located in major population centers in which patients are likely to be located and within close proximity of major airports. In the future, it may be necessary to build new facilities, which would require a significant commitment of capital and may not then be available to us. Even if we are able to establish such new facilities, we may experience challenges in ensuring that they are compliant with cGMP standards, FDA requirements, and/or applicable state or local regulations. We cannot be certain that we would be able to recoup the costs of establishing a facility in a given market. Given these risks, we could choose not to expand our cell processing and manufacturing services into new geographic markets which will limit our future growth prospects. To effectively and efficiently deliver cell therapy product, we also need to establish and maintain cost-effective relationships with reliable and experienced transportation carriers. Most existing transportation carriers are not optimally designed for the transportation of cell therapy products. For example, these carriers generally lack a true point-to-point chain of control, may have non-controlled X-ray and inspection, do not guarantee package orientation, handling or storage conditions and, in many cases, lack a standard, documented and tracked operating procedures. While reliable ground carriers with experience in the transport of blood products exist in major U.S. metropolitan areas, air carriers meeting such needs are limited. If carriers we currently use should cease medical shipping operations or otherwise become unable to properly meet our transportation needs, the lack of access to safe, reliable and effective transportation options could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' and our own needs.RISK RELATED TO OUR CORD BLOOD AND STEM CELL STORAGE BUSINESSThere is no guarantee that the market for our cord blood and adult stem cell collection and storage business will develop, and it exposes us to risks inherent in the collection and long-term storage of these products.Through NeoStem Family Storage, we provide services related to the collection and storage of umbilical cord blood units and adult stem cells, which we store at our Allendale, New Jersey facility. There currently is no significant global market for stem cell collection and storage, nor is there any guarantee that such markets will develop in the near future, or at all. Major medical institutions currently do not generally recommend private storage, and we believe that the medical community is supportive of the public cord blood collection system. Patients can donate their cord blood to the public cord blood collection system without charge. In addition, the value of our cord blood storage services is related to the higher success rate of autologous cord blood transplants over unrelated ones. If medical research discovers new and more effective medical procedures that make allogeneic cord blood transplants safer and more effective, the clinical advantage of storing a child's umbilical cord blood for his or her own future therapeutic use may significantly decline.The operation of a cord blood and adult stem cell storage system also exposes us to a number of risks. For example, adverse outcomes or limitations of our stem cell or cord blood collection and storage services, the damage, destruction or a failure in the performance of the cryopreservation storage facility or systems of our service providers, could harm our reputation and business and expose us to significant liability from customers. While we believe that we have procured insurance to cover certain of these risks, we may in fact have insufficient insurance to cover losses beyond the limits on its policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.39IndexRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONThe development and commercialization of our product candidates is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and abroad, and the failure to receive regulatory approvals for our cell therapy product candidates would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.To date, we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. If we seek approval of our cell therapy product candidates, we will be required to submit to FDA and European regulatory authorities extensive preclinical and clinical data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as information about the manufacturing process and to undergo inspection of our PCT manufacturing facilities, among other things. The process of obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is expensive, generally takes many years and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, particularly with complex and/or novel product candidates such as AMR-001 and our other product candidates. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application or may make it easier for our competitors to gain regulatory approval to enter the marketplace. Ultimately, the FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our product candidate data are insufficient for approval without the submission of additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying agency interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.Any of the following factors, among others, could cause regulatory approval for our product candidates to be delayed, limited or denied: the product candidates require significant clinical testing to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before applications for marketing approval can be filed with the FDA and other regulatory authorities; data obtained from preclinical and nonclinical animal testing and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways, and regulatory authorities may not agree with our respective interpretations or may require us to conduct additional testing; negative or inconclusive results or the occurrence of serious or unexpected adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate development efforts for a product candidate; and/or FDA and other regulatory authorities may require expansion of the size and scope of the clinical trials.Any difficulties or failures that we encounter in securing regulatory approval for our product candidates would likely have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to generate product sales, and could make any search for a collaborative partner more difficult.We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to comply with applicable federal, state and international laws and regulations, which could result in loss of licensure, certification or accreditation or other government enforcement actions or impact our ability to secure regulatory approval of our product candidates.Although we seek to conduct our business in compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are exceedingly complex and often subject to varying interpretations. The cell therapy industry is the topic of significant government interest, and thus the laws and regulations applicable to our business are subject to frequent change and/or reinterpretation. As such, there can be no assurance that we will be able, or will have the resources, to maintain compliance with all such healthcare laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such healthcare laws and regulations, as well as the costs associated with such compliance or with enforcement of such healthcare laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our operations or may require restructuring of our operations or impair our ability to operate profitably.Facilities engaged in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging or distribution of any HCT/Ps, or the screening or testing of a donor, are required to register with the FDA. Any third party retained by us to process our samples must be similarly registered with the FDA and comply with HCT/P regulations. We also are required to comply with FDA's cGTP regulations. If we fail to register or update registration information in a timely way, or fail to comply with cGTP regulations, we will be out of compliance with FDA regulations which could adversely affect our business. Our manufacture of certain cellular therapy products for ourselves or at PCT on behalf of our customers triggers additional FDA requirements applicable to HCT/Ps, or products comprised of HCT/Ps, which are regulated as a drug, biological product, or medical device. FDA's cGMP regulations govern the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of cell therapy products 40Indexregulated as drugs. FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, similarly governs the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of cell therapy products regulated as medical devices. We must comply with cGMP or QSR requirements including quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation for certain products. We may be unable to comply with these cGMP or QSR requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. These requirements may change over time and we or third-party manufacturers may be unable to comply with the revised requirements.If we are unable to conduct clinical studies in accordance with regulations and accepted standards, we may be delayed in receiving, or may never receive, regulatory approvals of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.To obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates in the United States and abroad, we must, among other requirements, complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory bodies that the product candidate is safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. If a serious adverse event occurs during one of our clinical studies, the FDA can place one or more of our clinical trials on hold if, among other reasons, it finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. If safety concerns develop, we may, or the FDA or an institutional review board may require us to, stop the affected trials before completion. Our Phase 1 trial of AMR-001 was subject to a clinical hold following the death of a subject in the study. We presented evidence that the death was the result of ventricular fibrillation attributed to recurrent myocardial infarction from stent thrombosis preceding infusion of AMR-001 and the FDA lifted the clinical hold.The completion of our clinical trials also may be delayed or terminated for a number of other reasons, including if: third-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices required by the FDA and other regulatory requirements, or other third parties do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; inspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or by institutional review boards of research institutions participating in the clinical trials, reveal regulatory violations that require the sponsor of the trial to undertake corrective action, suspend or terminate one or more sites, or prohibit use of some or all of the data in support of marketing applications; or the FDA or one or more institutional review boards suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site, or precludes enrollment of additional subjects.Our development costs will increase if there are material delays in our clinical trials, or if we are required to modify, suspend, terminate or repeat a clinical trial. If we are unable to conduct our clinical trials properly, we may never receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates.We will continue to be subject to extensive FDA regulation following any product approvals, and if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may suffer a significant setback in our business.Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to the requirements of and review by, the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in the areas of manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, adverse event reporting, labeling, advertising and promotional activities, among other things. In addition, any marketing approval we receive may be limited in terms of the approved product indication or require costly post-marketing testing and surveillance. Discovery after approval of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or manufacturing process, or a failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as: warning letters or other actions requiring changes in product manufacturing processes or restrictions on product marketing or distribution; product recalls or seizures or the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product from the market; and fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue, the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.The occurrence of any of these actions would likely cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Health care companies have been the subjects of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future.Both federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. There are numerous ongoing investigations of health care companies, as well as their executives and managers. In addition, amendments to the Federal False Claims Act, including under Healthcare Reform, have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” (whistleblower) 41Indexlawsuits against companies under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government. The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that an action can be brought against any person or entity that has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti-kickback law, Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA, may be considered a violation of the Federal False Claims Act. Penalties include substantial fines for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person or entity and/or exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, a majority of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.We are not aware of any government investigations involving any of our facilities or management. While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, any future investigations of our business or executives could cause us to incur substantial costs, and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.It is uncertain to what extent the government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the therapies and products to which our services relate. Availability for such reimbursement may be further limited by an increasing uninsured population and reductions in Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States.To the extent that health care providers cannot obtain coverage or reimbursement for our therapies and products, they may elect not to provide such therapies and products to their patients and, thus, may not need our services. Further, as cost containment pressures are increasing in the health care industry, government and private payors may adopt strategies designed to limit the amount of reimbursement paid to health care providers. Similarly, the trend toward managed health care and bundled pricing for health care services in the United States, which may accelerate under the healthcare reform legislation approved by Congress on March 23, 2010 and thereafter signed into law (“Healthcare Reform”), could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products, resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our therapeutic products under development.We may receive a portion of our revenues from services rendered to patients enrolled in federal health care programs, such as Medicare, and we may also directly or indirectly receive revenues from federal health care programs. Federal health care programs are subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could materially decrease the range of services covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid directly or indirectly for our products and services. To the extent that any health care reform favors the reimbursement of other therapies over our therapeutic products under development, such reform could affect our ability to sell our services, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.The limitation on reimbursement available from private and government payors may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the revenues generated from the sale of our products and services.Furthermore, there has been a trend in recent years towards reductions in overall funding for Medicare and Medicaid. There has also been an increase in the number of people who do not have any form of health care coverage in recent years and who are not eligible for or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The extent to which the reforms brought about under Healthcare Reform may be successful in reducing the number of such uninsured is unclear, and the reduced funding of governmental programs and increase in uninsured populations could have a negative impact on the demand for our services to the extent they relate to products and services which are reimbursed by government and private payors.Unintended consequences of recently adopted healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. may adversely affect our business.The healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the U.S., comprehensive programs are under consideration that seek to, among other things, increase access to healthcare for the uninsured and control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy. On March 23, 2010, healthcare reform legislation was approved by Congress and has been signed into law. While we do not believe this legislation will have a direct impact on our business, the legislation has only recently been enacted and requires the adoption of implementing regulations, which may have unintended consequences or indirectly impact our business. For instance, the scope and implications of the recent amendments pursuant to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”), have yet to be fully determined or adjudicated and as a result it is difficult to predict how future enforcement initiatives may impact our business. Also, in some instances our clients may be health insurers that will be subject to limitations on their administrative expenses and new federal review of 42Index“unreasonable” rate increases that could impact the prices they pay for our services. If the legislation causes such unintended consequences or indirect impact, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Competitor companies or hospitals may be able to take advantage of EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without a marketing authorization.The EU medicines rules allow individual member states to permit the supply of a medicinal product without a marketing authorization to fulfill special needs, where the product is supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of a healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility. This may in certain countries also apply to products manufactured in a country outside the EU and imported to treat specific patients or small groups of patients. In addition, advanced therapy medicinal products do not need a marketing authorization if they are prepared on a non-routine basis and are used within the same EU member state in a hospital in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient.These exemptions could allow our competitors to make sales in the EU without having obtained a marketing authorization and without undergoing the expense of clinical trials, especially if those competitors have cell processing facilities in the relevant EU member state. Similarly, certain hospitals may be able to compete with us on the basis of these rules. Because any such sales would be made without a marketing authorization, there would be no need for the competitor company or hospital to refer to the clinical data in our marketing authorization dossiers, and so any data exclusivity protection that we may obtain for our products would not prevent such competing sales.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYWe may be unable able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for new technologies, product candidates, products and processes and successfully defending such patents against third party challenges. To that end, we file patent applications, and have been issued patents, that are intended to cover certain methods and uses of stem cells, including very small embryonic-like stem cells, as well as compositions and methods relating to T regulatory cells and hematopoietic stem cells. These patent applications may never result in the issuance of patents.The patent positions of biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions and recent court decisions have introduced significant uncertainty regarding the strength of patents in the industry. Moreover, the legal systems of some foreign countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Any of the issued patents we own or license may be challenged by third parties and held to be invalid, unenforceable or with a narrower or different scope of coverage that what we currently believe, effectively reducing or eliminating protection we believed we had against competitors with similar products or technologies. If we ultimately engage in and lose any such patent disputes, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, we could be required to enter into third-party licenses or we could be required to cease using the disputed technology or product. In addition, even if such licenses are available, the terms of any license requested by a third party could be unacceptable to us. The claims of any current or future patents that may issue or be licensed to us may not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing the covered technologies and thus may provide us with little commercial protection against competing products. For instance, patents relating to our AMR-001 product candidate are limited to an isolated and non-expanded population of autologous mononuclear cells enriched for CD34 cells, which further contains a subpopulation of potent CD34/CXCR4 cells that have CXCR4 mediated chemotactic activity. Products that do not contain enriched CD34/CXCR4 cells, or which contain populations of cells that derive efficacy from a different mechanism of action, may not infringe the existing AMR-001 patents. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. To the extent a competitor can develop similar products using a different chemistry, our patents and patent applications may not prevent others from directly competing with us.Product development and approval timelines in the biotechnology industry are very lengthy. As such, it is possible that any patents that may cover an approved product may have expired at the time of commercialization or only have a short remaining period of exclusivity, thereby reducing the commercial advantages of the patent. In such case, we would then rely solely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which may provide less protection to our competitive position.43IndexLitigation relating to intellectual property is expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to protect against infringement by third parties or defend ourselves against claims of infringement. To protect our intellectual property, we may initiate litigation or other proceedings. In general, intellectual property litigation is costly, time-consuming, diverts the attention of management and technical personnel and could result in substantial uncertainty regarding our future viability, even if we ultimately prevail. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or other proceedings more effectively than can we because of their substantially greater financial resources. The loss or narrowing of our intellectual property protection, the inability to secure or enforce our intellectual property rights or a finding that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party could limit our ability to develop or market our products and services in the future or adversely affect our revenues. Furthermore, any public announcements related to such litigation or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Third parties may allege that the research, development and commercialization activities we conduct infringe patents or other proprietary rights owned by such parties. While we do not believe any of our current activities infringe the rights of others, we have not conducted an exhaustive search or analysis of third-party patent rights to determine whether our pre-clinical or clinical research and development or activities may infringe or be alleged to infringe any third-party patent rights. If we are found to have infringed the patents of a third party, we may be required to pay substantial damages; we also may be required to seek from such party a license, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, to continue our activities. A judicial finding or infringement or the failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from commercializing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to maintain our licenses, patents or other intellectual property we could lose important protections that are material to continuing our operations and our future prospects.To obtain and maintain patent protection and licensing rights under certain of our license agreement, we must, among other things, ensure the timely payment of all applicable filing and maintenance fees. Any failure to do so could result in the loss of some or all of our rights to proprietary technology or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection. Additionally, our license agreements require us to meet certain diligence obligations in the development of the licensed products. Our failure to meet these diligence obligations could result in the loss of some or all of our rights, which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects.If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets, our competitive position could be impaired.A significant amount of our technology, especially regarding manufacturing processes, is unpatented and is maintained as trade secrets. We expend significant efforts in an effort to protect these trade secrets, including through the use of confidentiality agreement. Even so, improper use or disclosure of our confidential information could occur and in such case adequate remedies may not exist. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our Company's competitive position.In certain countries, patent holders may be required to grant compulsory licenses, which would likely have a significant and detrimental effect on any future revenues in such country. Many countries, including some countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving products is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries, either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to our product candidates, which may limit our potential revenue opportunities, including with respect to any future revenues that may result from AMR-001 or Tregs.Changes to U.S. Patent Law may have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property rights.The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which was signed into law on September 16, 2011, significantly changes United States patent law. It may take some time to establish what the law means, since regulations that will govern how the new law is implemented have not yet been established, and since the law has not yet been implemented, it has not yet been interpreted by the lower courts, and reviewed by either the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, a process that will take years. The first major change is that AIA switches the U.S. patent system from a “first to invent” system to a “first to file” system. Once the first to file system is in effect, there is a risk that another company may independently develop identical or similar patents 44Indexat approximately the same time, and be awarded the patents instead of us. Once “first to file” is implemented, there will no longer be a need to determine who is the inventor of an invention. As a result, for the second major change, AIA abolishes interference proceedings, and establishes derivation proceedings to replace interference proceedings in all cases in which the time period for instituting an interference proceeding has not lapsed where an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed invention from a named inventor. Once derivation proceedings are in effect, there is a risk that the inventorship of any pending patent application can be challenged for reasons of derivation. The third major change is that AIA establishes post-grant opposition proceedings that will apply to patent applications filed after “first to file” becomes effective. Post-grant opposition will enable a person who is not the patent owner to initiate proceedings in the Patent office within 9 months after the grant of a patent that can result in cancellation of a patent as invalid. Therefore there is a risk that any of our patents once granted after the effective date of these provisions of the new law (March 16, 2013) may be subject to post-grant opposition, which will increase uncertainty on the validity of any newly granted patent or may ultimately result in cancellation of the patent.45IndexITEM 1B.
