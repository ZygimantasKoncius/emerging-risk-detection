Risk Factors-Risk factors relating to Us-Our ability to repay indebtedness at the holding company level may be impaired due to the lack of liquidity at such level. -162- Table of Contents Each of our subsidiaries is responsible for their own liquidity management. For a discussion of the Banks liquidity management, see -Banco Galicias Liquidity Management-Banco Galicia (Unconsolidated) Liquidity Management. Consolidated Cash Flows Our consolidated statements of cash flows were prepared using the measurement methods prescribed by the Argentine Central Bank, but in accordance with the presentation requirements of SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. See our consolidated cash flow statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006, included in this annual report. As of December 31, 2008, on a consolidated basis, we had Ps. 4,795.4 million in available cash (defined as total cash on hand and cash equivalents), representing a Ps. 1,029.2 million increase from the Ps. 3,766.2 million as of December 31, 2007. At the end of fiscal year 2007, our available cash (and cash equivalents) had decreased in the amount of Ps. 1,222.0 million from the Ps. 4,988.2 million of available cash (and cash equivalents) at the end of the prior fiscal year. Effective May 14, 2007, and in accordance with the provisions of Argentine Central Banks Communiqué A 4667, cash equivalents are comprised of the following: Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac) having a remaining maturity that does not exceed 90 days, securities in connection with reverse repurchase transactions with the Argentine Central Bank, short term call loans to corporations, local interbank loans, and overnight placements in correspondent banks abroad. Cash equivalents also comprise, in the case of the regional credit card companies, time deposit certificates and mutual fund shares. The table below summarizes the information from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, which is also discussed in more detail below.

In the last years, these activities have also included reducing our public-sector exposure through both sales and collections. Our financing activities primarily include raising customer deposits, in addition to entering into sales of government securities under repurchase agreements, issuing bonds in the local and foreign capital markets and borrowing from foreign and local banks and international credit agencies. In the last few years, these activities have also included reducing expensive liabilities incurred as a consequence of the 2001-2002 crisis. As shown by the table above, and explained in more detail below, in the last three years and consistently with our strategy of strengthening our balance sheet, we have generated significant amounts of cash from our exposure to the public sector, which represents mainly the Banks exposure, for approximately Ps. 3,080.8 million in 2006 and Ps. 2,683.9 million and Ps. 302.4 million, respectively, in 2007 and 2008, and have used cash generated by such assets (as well as these assets directly) mainly to repay debt with the Argentine Central Bank and restructured foreign debt, both representing liabilities incurred as a consequence of or related to the 2001-2002 crisis. Such public-sector assets are associated both with our operating activities (mainly Bogar Bonds and Boden 2012 Bonds) and our investing activities (Secured Loans). Cash was generated by proceeds from the sale of such public-sector assets as well as from the collection of principal and interest on such assets. Proceeds from Bogar Bonds and Secured Loans were mostly used for the repayment of Argentine Central Bank debt while proceeds from Boden 2012 Bonds were used for the repayment of restructured foreign debt. Proceeds from Boden 2012 Bonds were particularly significant in fiscal year 2006 when, due to the acquisition of most of the Hedge Bond, the Bank collected past due amortization and interest on the acquired Boden 2012 Bonds, corresponding to that year and to the prior fiscal year. In addition, sales of Secured Loans were most significant in 2006. The cash accumulated at the close of fiscal year 2006 was applied to the repayment of Argentine Central Bank debt and restructured foreign debt in early 2007. In 2008, due to the international economic crisis and its local impact, our main source of funds was funds available at the end of the fiscal year due to a decrease in loans to the private sector (in replacement of our principal source of funding: deposits). In years 2007 and 2006, due to the aggressive repayment of the above-mentioned liabilities, cash and cash equivalents generated by operating activities were used by investing activities and financing activities, except in fiscal year 2006 in which investing activities actually provided cash due to sales of Secured Loans. However, cash was generated also, to a large extent, by deposit raising and other sources (securitizations of loans, by both the Bank and the regional credit card companies, repurchases and bank borrowings in the case of the Bank and negotiable obligations issuances by the regional credit card companies) in amounts sufficient to fund our growing business with the private sector and the significant increases in our lending to such sector. -164- Table of Contents Management believes that cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalent balances, will be sufficient to fund our financial commitments and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009. Cash Flows from Operating Activities In fiscal year 2008, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our net income of Ps. 176.8 million and amounted to Ps. 888.6 million, due to the depreciation and amortization of intangibles assets, which represent non-cash expenses, of Ps. 161.3 million, loan loss provisions, which, similarly, do not require cash at the time of provision and which, net of reversals, amounted to Ps. 335.7 million and a decrease of Ps. 839.2 million of government securities attributable to the collection of amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds for Ps. 621.1 million, sales of Boden 2012 Bonds and Argentine bonds for Ps. 68.0 million and Ps. 64.5 million of Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac) having a remaining maturity that exceed 90 days. In addition, net cash was provided by other fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities: (i) Ps. 113.2 million capitalization of CER adjustment, (ii) Ps. 86.8 million of interest on repurchases, (iii) Ps. 76.0 million of minimum presumed income tax, and (iv) Ps. 79.3 million of securitization of loans which represents non-cash income. Cash generated from operating activities was lower than in fiscal year 2007, basically because of fewer sales of government securities. In fiscal year 2007, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our net income and amounted to Ps. 2,449.8 million, due to depreciation and amortization of intangibles assets, which represent non-cash expenses, for Ps. 214.6 million, and loan loss provisions, which, similarly, do not require cash at the time of provision and which, net of reversals, amounted to Ps. 269.2 million. In addition, net cash was provided by the following fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities: (i) a Ps. 1,589.5 million decrease in government securities mainly attributable to sales of Bogar Bonds excluding CER adjustments for Ps. 208.0 million, sales of Boden 2012 Bonds for Ps. 601.5 million, collection of amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds for Ps. 639.9 million, and collection of amortization and interest on Bogar Bonds and Secured Loans, (ii) Ps. 485.6 million collection of the CER adjustment associated with Bogar Bonds sold, net of payments for Ps. 161.3 million on other debt (premiums on repurchases, short-term loans, etc.). Cash generated from operating activities was lower than in fiscal year 2006, basically because in fiscal year 2006 collection on Boden 2012 Bonds was of an extraordinary amount, while such collection was normalized in 2007. In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to Ps. 3,548.1 million, due to depreciation and amortization, of Ps. 92.9 million, and loan loss provisions net of reversals of Ps. 80.9 million. In addition, net cash was provided by the following fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities: (i) a Ps. 1,267.5 million decrease in government securities, mainly due to sales of Bogar Bonds and the monthly collection of principal and interest on those bonds (excluding the CER adjustment), for Ps. 1,254.1 million, (ii) a Ps. 1,064.4 million decrease in other assets, mainly attributable to proceeds from Boden 2012 Bonds, for Ps. 1,126.2 million (collection of past due amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds corresponding to the portion of the Hedge Bond that was pending receipt as of the end of fiscal 2005 and that was delivered to us in late 2006, and amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds sold under agreements to repurchase), (iii) collection of Ps. 891.9 million associated with the CER adjustment mainly corresponding to public-sector assets sold, and (iv) a Ps. 162.3 million increase in debt with retailers of the regional credit card companies. The increase from the amount generated in 2005 is attributable to greater proceeds from our exposure to the public sector, mainly collection of past due principal and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds when these bonds were acquired and the cashing in of the CER adjustment on Secured Loans sold. -165- Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities In fiscal year 2008, net cash generated by investing activities decreased to Ps. 1,057.1 million. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease of Ps. 1,501.3 million in our private-sector loan portfolio. In addition, cash equal to Ps. 403.1 million was applied to bank premises and equipment, miscellaneous and intangible assets, including payments of deposits pursuant to amparo claims. Cash used by investing activities decreased from 2007, as our private-sector loan portfolio decreased, because of the international financial crisis and its local impact. In fiscal year 2007, net cash used by investing activities increased to Ps. 1,715.7 million. This increase was mainly attributable to the use of Ps. 1,410.8 million to fund the increase in the Banks loan portfolio resulting from a Ps. 2,027.8 million net increase in our private-sector loan portfolio (net of securitizations for Ps. 617.0 million) and was partially offset by the sale of Secured Loans. In addition, cash for Ps. 287.6 million was applied to bank premises and equipment, miscellaneous and intangible assets, mainly representing payments of deposits pursuant to amparo claims. Cash used by investing activities increased from 2006, as our private-sector loan portfolio increased, loan securitization was slightly lower and less cash was generated by the sale of Secured Loans. In fiscal year 2006 investing activities generated cash for Ps. 689.3 million, mainly due to the Ps. 894.1 million net decrease in the Banks loan portfolio resulting from the sale of Secured Loans, which more than offset the net increase in loans to the private sector. The use of cash to extend loans to the private sector was only of Ps. 27.3 million because this amount is net of the securitized loans of both the Bank and the regional credit card companies, which generated cash for Ps. 684.9 million in aggregate. In addition, cash for Ps. 196.3 million was applied to bank premises and equipment, miscellaneous and intangible assets, mainly representing payments of deposits pursuant to amparo claims. Cash Flows from Financing Activities In fiscal year 2008, financing activities used cash in the amount of Ps. 1,065.6 million, mainly due to: (i) a Ps. 474.0 million net decrease in long term credit facilities, mainly corresponding to: (a) payments of interest on restructured debt for US$ 49 million, (b) the payment of two amortization installments on debt due 2010 for US$ 68.4 million, (c) the prepayment of the Banks 2014 Notes for US$ 30.2 million, (d) a reduction of US$ 24.6 million of Banco Galicia Uruguays restructured debt structured as negotiable obligations, (e) an increase of Ps. 153.6 million of IFC loans and (f) a Ps. 80.5 million net decrease in funds obtained by the regional credit card companies through the issuance of negotiable obligations; (ii) a Ps. 376.6 million net decrease in repurchase transactions; -166- Table of Contents (iii) a Ps. 156.6 million net decrease in short-term borrowings, mainly due to: (a) the decrease in borrowings from local and foreign banks, for Ps. 81.0 million and (b) the payment of US$ 24.0 million as part of a US$ 80 million loan granted to us in last year; and (iv) a Ps. 57.0 million decrease in deposits, corresponding to: (a) a decrease of Ps. 908.4 million in time deposits and (b) an increase of Ps. 868.1 million in demand deposits. In fiscal year 2007, financing activities used cash in the amount of Ps. 2,003.9 million, mainly due to a Ps. 1,752.5 million net increase in deposits, a Ps. 229.9 million net increase in repurchase transactions, a Ps. 174.9 million net increase in long term credit facilities (representing funds obtained by the regional credit card companies through the issuance of negotiable obligations), and a Ps. 407.5 million increase in funds obtained mainly from financial institutions and credit agencies (including part of the US$ 80 million loan granted to us and a Ps. 102.9 million credit line from the Inter-American Development Bank for on lending to SMEs), which increases were more than offset by the following: (i) a Ps. 1,823.5 million decrease in long-term liabilities, mainly corresponding to: (a) payments of interest on restructured debt for Ps. 280.0 million, (b) principal amortization of the 2007 Notes for Ps. 121.6 million, (c) payments by the regional credit card companies on negotiable obligations for Ps. 151.0 million, (d) repurchases of loans due 2010 and 2014 for Ps. 593.3 million, (e) payment of two amortization installments on debt due 2010 for Ps. 277.9 million, (f) prepayment of 2010 Notes for Ps. 155.9 million and of 2014 Notes for Ps. 119.1 million, (g) prepayment of 2014 Notes triggered by the cash subscription for the Banks capital increase under our restructured foreign debt agreements, for Ps. 71.5 million, and (i) settlement by Galicia Uruguay of restructured debt, for Ps. 53.2 million, and (ii) a Ps. 2,332.5 million decrease of short-term borrowings, mainly due to the full repayment of financial assistance from the Argentine Central Bank, for Ps. 2,713.0 million, partially offset by an increase in borrowings from local banks, for Ps. 102.9 million. In fiscal year 2006 financing activities used Ps. 1,302.4 million of cash, mainly due to a Ps. 1,894.3 million net increase in deposits, a Ps. 934.4 million increase in repurchase transactions, and a Ps. 418.0 million increase in long term credit facilities (representing funds obtained by the regional credit card companies), which increases were more than offset by: (i) a Ps. 687.0 million decrease in long-term liabilities, mainly due to: (a) payments of interest on restructured debt for Ps. 326.2 million, (b) principal amortization on 2007 Notes for Ps. 118.5 million, (c) payments by the regional credit card companies on negotiable obligations for Ps. 178.9 million, and (d) settlement by Galicia Uruguay of restructured debt, for Ps. 30.5 million, and (ii) a Ps. 3,856.8 million decrease in short-term borrowings due to payments on short-term borrowings, mainly financial assistance from the Argentine Central Bank, for Ps. 2,665.0 million (including both scheduled payments and amounts settled in advance), and on the advance from such entity for the acquisition of the Hedge Bond, for Ps. 1,369.7 million, net of increased borrowings (short-term call loans) from local banks for Ps. 75.5 million and increased financing from the IFC, for Ps. 64.0 million. -167- Table of Contents For a description of the types of financial interests we use and the maturity profile of our debt, currency and interest rate structure, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Operating Results. Banco Galicias Liquidity Management Banco Galicia Consolidated Liquidity Gaps Liquidity risk is the risk that liquid assets are not available for the Bank to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities and meet demand for credit. To monitor and control liquidity risk, the Bank monitors and systematically calculates the gaps between financial assets and liabilities maturing within set time intervals based on contractual remaining maturity, on a consolidated basis with Galicia Uruguay and the regional credit card companies. All of the deposits in current accounts and other demand deposits and deposits in savings accounts are included in the first time interval. These figures are used to simulate different liquidity crisis scenarios based on assumptions stemming from historical experience. As of December 31, 2008, the consolidated gaps between maturities of the Banks financial assets and liabilities based on contractual remaining maturity were as follows: As of December 31, 2008 (1) Less than one Year 1  5 Years 5  10 Years Over 10 Years Total (in millions of Pesos, except ratios) Assets Cash and Due from Banks 1,368.4    1,368.4 Argentine Central Bank  Escrow Accounts 2,294.6    2,294.6 Overnight Placements 334.5    334.5 Loans  Public Sector 1,378.9 3.8   1,382.7 Loans  Private Sector 7,984.7 1,530.7 286.9 22.1 9,824.4 Government Securities 1,463.6 1,544.9   3,008.5 Negotiable Obligations and Corporate Securities 1.0 37.2 6.8 0.4 45.4 Financial Trusts 265.4 339.2 630.9 0.3 1,235.8 Special Fund Former Almafuerte Bank 230.5 154.9   385.4 Assets under Financial Lease 161.1 259.4 65.7 6.5 492.7 Other  Argentine Central Bank 359.4    359.4 Total Assets 15,842.1 3,870.1 990.3 29.3 20,731.8 Liabilities Savings Accounts 4,056.6    4,056.6 Demand Deposits 3,312.3    3,312.3 Time Deposits 6,587.6 47.2 0.1 0.1 6,635.0 Negotiable Obligations 552.3 1,284.0 989.3  2,825.6 International Banks and Credit Agencies 412.1 282.9 76.7  771.7 Domestic Banks 123.6 242.0 28.7  394.3 Other Liabilities (1) 2,392.9 290.8   2,683.7 Total Liabilities 17,437.4 2,146.9 1,094.8 0.1 20,679.2 Asset / Liability Gap (1,595.3 ) 1,723.2 (104.5 ) 29.2 52.6 Cumulative Gap (1,595.3 ) 127.9 23.4 52.6 52.6 Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Cumulative Liabilities (9.2 )% 0.7 % 0.1 % 0.3 % Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Total Liabilities (7.7 )% 0.6 % 0.1 % 0.3 % Principal plus CER adjustment. Does not include interest. (1) Includes, mainly, debt with retailers due to credit card operations, liabilities in connection with repurchase transactions, debt with domestic credit agencies and collections for third parties. The Less than One Year bucket also includes Ps. 5.8 million corresponding to the Banks foreign debt not tendered by its holders in the exchange offered to restructure such foreign debt, which was completed in May 2004. -168- Table of Contents The Banks Board of Directors has defined a maximum limit for liquidity mismatches. This limit has been established at -25% (minus 25%) for the ratio of cumulative gap to total liabilities within the first year. As shown in the table above, the Bank complies with said established policy since such gap was -7.7% (minus 7.7%) at the end of fiscal year 2008. As mentioned above, all of the deposits in current accounts and other demand deposits and deposits in savings accounts are included in the first time interval. However, historical experience shows that between 40% and 50% of these deposits represent a stable funding for the Bank and that such funding and the renewal of time deposits at maturity have funded the first-year negative gap. In addition, the Bank follows a liquidity policy based on the worst-case scenario of the recent economic history in Argentina, which policy is explained below. Banco Galicia (Unconsolidated) Liquidity Management The following is a discussion of the Banks liquidity management, excluding the consolidated companies. The Banks policy is to maintain a level of liquid assets that allows it to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities, and meet customers credit demand. To set the appropriate level, forecasts are made based on historical experience and on an analysis of possible scenarios. This enables management to project funding needs and alternative funding sources, as well as excess liquidity and placement strategies for such funds. As of December 31, 2008, the Banks unconsolidated liquidity structure was as follows: As of December 31, 2008 (in millions of Pesos) Legal Requirement Ps. 3,207.3 Excess Liquidity 1,497.9 Total Liquidity (1) Ps. 4,705.2 (1) Excludes cash and due from banks of consolidated companies. The legal requirement refers to the Minimum Cash Requirements set by Argentine Central Bank regulations, minus the permitted reduction in the requirement in the amount of the balance of the Special Fund Former Almafuerte Bank as per Resolution No. 408/03 of the Argentine Central Bank. For more information on the Argentine Central Bank regulations regarding reserve requirements for liquidity purposes, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Legal Reserve Requirements for Liquidity Purposes. Excess liquidity consists of the following items: (i) 100% of the balance of overnight placements in banks abroad, (ii) the net amount of the margin requirement for short-term loans (call loans) to prime companies, (iii) 90% of the Lebac balance, (iv) 100% of the market value of available government securities, due to the potential liquidity that might be obtained through sales or repurchase transactions, (v) net short-term interbank loans (call loans), and (vi) 100% of the balance at the Argentine Central Bank (including escrow accounts in favor of clearing houses) in excess of the necessary items to cover the Minimum Cash Requirements. -169- Table of Contents The Bank sets its total liquidity objective based on the analysis of the behavior of the Banks deposits during the 2001-2002 crisis, considered as the worst-case scenario. Two liquidity levels are taken into account: the operational liquidity (to address the Banks daily operations) and the additional liquidity (excess amount available). Deposits are classified into wholesale deposits and retail deposits. Operational liquidity was established at 5% of retail demand deposits and time deposits maturing in less than 10 days, plus the balance of the escrow accounts held at the Argentine Central Bank and the balances in correspondent banks needed to address foreign-trade operations. Additional liquidity varies according to the remaining maturity of the different types of deposits and to the currency in which such deposits are denominated. As a result of the analysis performed, the Bank defined a floor for the additional liquidity in Pesos at 50% of the necessary funds to face the worst-case scenario and for the additional liquidity in US Dollars the floor was set at 70% of the funds necessary to bear the worst-case scenario. Simultaneously, a margin must be kept in order to face a potential drop in deposits of 10% in Pesos and 15% in US Dollars without failing to meet the Minimum Cash Requirements. At the end of fiscal year 2008, the additional liquidity included in the above table amounted to Ps. 2,109.0 million and US$ 483.9 million, equivalent to 50% and to 154% of the worst-case scenario, respectively, with both percentages exceeding the policy limits established by the Bank. Capital Our capital management policy is designed to ensure prudent levels of capital. The following table analyzes our capital resources as of the dates indicated. As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions of Pesos, except ratios, multiples and percentages) Shareholders Equity Ps. 1,845.7 Ps. 1,654.5 Ps. 1,608.5 Shareholders Equity as a Percentage of Total Assets 7.46 % 7.25 % 6.81 % Total Liabilities as a Multiple of Total Shareholders Equity 12.40 x 12.80 x 13.68 x Tangible Shareholders Equity (1) as a Percentage of Total Assets 5.17 % 5.28 % 4.68 % (1) Tangible shareholders equity represents shareholders equity minus intangible assets.

Such amount cannot exceed six percent (6%) of the Banks net income before income tax or any other tax that may replace it. Article 25, section 2, of the Banks Bylaws establishes that among the powers and duties of the Board of Directors, the Board may determine, whenever it is deemed desirable for corporate interests, whether its members shall perform technical or administrative duties within the Company and receive remuneration for such activities, with such remuneration having to be reported at the shareholders meeting. In such cases, compensation for the relevant Directors set by the shareholders meeting shall be charged to general expenses. The Banks Board of Directors establishes the policy for compensation of the Banks personnel. The Banks managers receive a fixed compensation and they may receive a variable compensation, based on their performance. Seven directors and an alternate director are employees of the Bank and, therefore, receive a fixed compensation and may also receive a variable compensation based on their performance, provided that these additional payments do not exceed the standard levels of similar entities in the Argentine financial market, a provision that is applicable to managers as well. The compensation regime includes the possibility of acquiring a retirement insurance policy. The Bank does not maintain stock-option plans or pension plans or any other retirement plans for the benefit of its directors and managers. The Bank does not have a policy establishing any termination benefit for its directors. The compensation of the Board of Directors must be approved by the shareholders meeting after the end of the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2008, the Banks ordinary shareholders meeting held on April 28, 2009, approved remuneration for the Banks Board of Directors in the total amount of Ps. 20.2 million, which includes the following:  total compensation, including salaries, variable compensation and other related concepts for the directors that are also employees and for executive and supervision functions they perform, and  compensation for the independent directors. During 2008, provisions were established to cover the variable compensation of the Banks Board of Directors and managers for the fiscal year. In January 2008, the Banks Board of Directors decided to pay the variable compensation corresponding to fiscal year 2007, based on the compensation for similar or equivalent positions in the market, in recognition of the performance and professional development of the respective beneficiaries during said fiscal year. The corresponding amount was funded with reserves established during said fiscal year. In January 2009, the Banks Board of Directors decided to pay a variable compensation to certain Bank employees for the fiscal year 2008, based on the compensation for similar or equal job positions in the labor market, in recognition of the performance and professional development of the respective beneficiaries during fiscal year 2008. The corresponding amount was funded with reserves established during said fiscal year. The Banks senior managers, excluding directors that are employees of the Bank, received compensation of Ps. 8.71 million for fiscal year 2008 and compensation of Ps. 8.2 million for fiscal year 2007. These amounts include fixed and variable compensations. -186- Table of Contents Employees The following table shows the composition of our staff: As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Grupo Financiero Galicia S.A. 9 10 8 Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires S.A. 5,324 5,164 4,676 Branches 2,888 2,604 2,414 Head Office 2,436 2,560 2,262 Galicia Uruguay 10 13 13 Regional Credit-Card Companies 3,898 3,769 3,174 Sudamericana Consolidated 105 96 91 Other Subsidiaries 62 51 46 Total 9,408 9,103 8,008 Within the current legal framework, membership in an employee union is voluntary and there is only one union of bank employees with national representation. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 9.6% of the Banks employees were affiliated with the national bank employee union. The employees of the regional credit card companies are affiliated with the national commerce employee union, in a percentage that ranged from 2.8% to 7.2%, depending on the company, as of December 31, 2008. During the first four months of 2008 and 2007, and during the first quarter of 2006, the bank employee union and the national commerce employee union renegotiated their respective collective labor agreements in order to establish new minimum wages. As a result, between March and April of each year, salary increases were granted. Banco Galicia has not experienced a strike by its employees since 1973 and the regional credit card companies have not experienced any strike event. We believe that our relationship with our employees has developed within normal and satisfactory parameters. We have a human resources policy that aims at providing our employees possibilities for growth and personal and socio-economic achievement. We will continue our current policy of monitoring both wage levels and labor conditions in the financial industry in order to be competitive. Our employees receive fixed compensation and may receive variable compensation according to their level of achievement. We do not maintain any profit-sharing programs for our employees. The Fundación Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires (the Fundación) is an Argentine non-profit organization that provides various services to Banco Galicia employees. The various activities of the Fundación include, among others, managing the medical services of Banco Galicia employees and their families, purchasing school materials for the children of Banco Galicias employees and making donations to hospitals and other charitable causes, including cultural events. The Fundación is managed by a Council, certain members and alternate members of which are members of our Board of Directors and supervisory committee. Members and alternate members of the Council do not receive remuneration for their services as trustees. -187- Table of Contents Nasdaq Corporate Governance Standards Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(a), a foreign private issuer may follow home country corporate governance practices in lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350, provided that the foreign private issuer complies with certain mandatory sections of Rule 4350, discloses each requirement of Rule 4350 that it does not follow and describes the home relevant country practice followed in lieu of such requirement. The requirements of Rule 4350 and the Argentine corporate governance practice that we follow in lieu thereof are described below: (i) Rule 4350 (b) (1) (A)  Distribution of Annual and Interim Reports. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (b) (1) (A), we follow Argentine law, which requires that companies make public a Spanish language annual report, including annual audited consolidated financial statements, by filing such annual report with the CNV and the BASE, within 70 calendar days of the end of the companys fiscal year. Interim reports must be filed with the CNV and the BASE within 42 calendar days of the end of each fiscal quarter. The BASE publishes the annual reports and interim reports in the BASE bulletin and makes the bulletin available for inspection at its offices. In addition, our shareholders can receive copies of our annual reports and any interim reports upon such shareholders request. English language translations of our annual reports and interim reports are furnished to the SEC. We also post the English language translation of our annual reports and quarterly press releases on our website. Furthermore, under the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of June 22, 2000, among us, The Bank of New York, as depositary, and owners of ADSs issued thereunder, we are required to furnish The Bank of New York with, among other things, English language translations of our annual reports and each of our quarterly press releases. Annual reports and quarterly press releases are available for inspection by ADR holders at the offices of The Bank of New York located at, 101 Barclay Street, 22nd Floor, New York, New York. Finally, Argentine law requires that 20 calendar days before the date of a shareholders meeting, the board of directors must provide to the shareholders, at the companys executive office or through electronic means, all information relevant to the shareholders meeting, including copies of any documents to be considered by the shareholders (which includes the annual report), as well as proposals of the companys board of directors. (ii) Rule 4350 (c) (1)  Majority of Independent Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (c) (1), we follow Argentine law, which does not require that a majority of the board of directors be comprised of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that public companies in Argentina such as us must have a sufficient number of independent directors to be able to form an audit committee of at least three members, the majority of which must be independent pursuant to the criteria established by the CNV. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 4350 (c) (5), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 4350 (c) (1). -188- Table of Contents (iii) Rule 4350 (c) (2)  Executive Sessions of the Board of Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (c) (2), we follow Argentine law which does not require independent directors to hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only such independent directors are present (i.e., executive sessions). Our Board of Directors as a whole is responsible for monitoring our affairs. In addition, under Argentine law, the board of directors may approve the delegation of specific responsibilities to designated directors or non-director managers of the company. Also, it is mandatory for public companies to form a supervisory committee (composed of syndics), which is responsible for monitoring the legality of the companys actions under Argentine law and the conformity thereof with its by-laws. Finally, our audit committee has regularly scheduled meetings and, as such, such meetings will serve a substantially similar purpose as executive sessions. (iv) Rule 4350 (c) (3)  Compensation of Officers. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (c) (3), we follow Argentine law, which does not require companies to form a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. It also is not required in Argentine law that the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers be determined by either a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. Under Argentine law, the board of directors is the corporate body responsible for determining the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers, so long as they are not directors. In addition, under Argentine law, the audit committee shall give its opinion about the reasonableness of managements proposals on fees and option plans for directors or managers of the company. Finally, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 4350 (c) (5), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 4350 (c) (3). (v) Rule 4350(c)(4)  Nomination of Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (c) (4), we follow Argentine law which requires that directors be nominated directly by the shareholders at the shareholders meeting and that they be selected and recommended by the shareholders themselves. Under Argentine law, it is the responsibility of the ordinary shareholders meeting to appoint and remove directors and to set their compensation. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 4350 (c) (5), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 4350 (c) (4). (vi) Rule 4350 (d) (1)  Audit Committee Charter. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (d) (1), we follow Argentine law, which requires that audit committees have a charter but does not require that companies certify as to the adoption of the charter nor does it require an annual review and assessment thereof. Argentine law instead requires that companies prepare a proposed plan or course of action with respect to those matters, which are the responsibility of the companys audit committee. Such plan or course of action could, at the discretion of our audit committee, include a review and assessment of the audit committee charter. (vii) Rule 4350 (d) (2)  Audit Committee Composition. Argentine law does not require, and it is equally not customary business practice in Argentina, that companies have an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that companies establish an audit committee with at least three members comprised of a majority of independent directors as defined by Argentine law. Nonetheless, although not required by Argentine law, we have a three member audit committee comprised of entirely independent directors, as independence is defined in Rule 10 (A)-3 (b) (1), one of which the Board of Directors has determined to be an audit committee financial expert. In addition, we have a supervisory committee (comisión fiscalizadora) composed of three syndics, which are in charge of monitoring the legality, under Argentine law, of the actions of our board of directors and the conformity of such actions with our by-laws. -189- Table of Contents (viii) Rule 4350 (f)  Quorum. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (f), we follow Argentine law and our bylaws, which distinguish between ordinary meetings and extraordinary meetings and require, in connection with ordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of a majority of stock entitled to vote. If no quorum is present at the first meeting, a second meeting may be called at which the shareholders present, whatever their number, constitute a quorum and resolutions may be adopted by an absolute majority of the votes present. Argentine law and our bylaws require, in connection with extraordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of 60% of the stock entitled to vote. However, if such quorum is not present at the first meeting, our bylaws provide that a second meeting may be called which may be held with the number of shareholders present. In both ordinary and extraordinary meetings, decisions are adopted by an absolute majority of votes present at the meeting, except for certain fundamental matters (such as mergers and spin-offs (when we are not the surviving entity and the surviving entity is not listed on any stock exchange), anticipated liquidation, a change in our domicile to outside of Argentina, total or partial recapitalization of our statutory capital following a loss, any transformation in our corporate legal form or a substantial change in our corporate purpose) which require an approval by vote of the majority of all the stock entitled to vote (all stock being entitled to only one vote). (ix) Rule 4350 (g)  Solicitation of Proxies. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (g), we follow Argentine law which requires that notices of shareholders meetings be published, for five consecutive days, in the Official Gazette and in a widely circulated newspaper in Argentina no earlier than 45 calendar days prior to the meeting and at least 20 calendar days prior to such meeting. In order to attend a meeting and be listed on the meeting registry, shareholders are required to submit evidence of their book-entry share account held at Caja de Valores S.A. (Caja de Valores) up to three business days prior to the scheduled meeting date. If entitled to attend the meeting, a shareholder may be represented by proxy (properly executed and delivered with a certified signature) granted to any other person, with the exception of a director, syndic, member of the surveillance committee (consejo de vigilancia), manager or employee of the issuer, which are prohibited by Argentine law from acting as proxies. In addition, our ADR holders receive, prior to the shareholders meeting, a notice listing the matters on the agenda, a copy of the annual report and a voting card. (x) Rule 4350 (h)  Conflicts of Interest. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350 (h), we follow Argentine law which requires that related party transactions be approved by the audit committee when the transaction exceeds one percent (1%) of the corporations net worth, measured pursuant to the last audited balance sheet, so long as the relevant transaction exceeds the equivalent of three hundred thousand Argentine Pesos (Ps. 300,000). Directors can contract with the corporation only on terms consistent with prevailing market terms. If the contract is not in accordance with prevailing market terms, such transaction must be pre-approved by the board of directors (excluding the interested director). In addition, under Argentine law, a shareholder is required to abstain from voting on a business transaction in which its interests may be in conflict with the interests of the company. In the event such shareholder votes on such business transaction and such business transaction would not have been approved without such shareholders vote, such shareholder may be liable to the company for damages and the resolution may be declared void. Other than as noted above, we are in full compliance with all other applicable Nasdaq corporate governance standards. -190- Table of Contents Share Ownership For information on the share ownership of our directors and executive officers as of December 31, 2008, see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions-Major Shareholders. Item 7.

Currently, there is one member of the controlling families on the Banks Board of Directors and four members of these families on our Board of Directors. In addition, there are two alternate directors on our Board of Directors that are members of the controlling families. On September 13, 1999, the controlling shareholders of Banco Galicia formed EBA Holding S.A., an Argentine corporation, which is 100% owned by our controlling shareholders. EBA Holding holds 100% of our class A shares. Currently, EBA Holding only has class A shares outstanding. EBA Holdings bylaws provide for certain restrictions on the sale or transfer of its class A shares. While the class A shares of EBA Holding may be transferred to any other class A shareholder of EBA Holding, any transfer of such class A shares to third parties would automatically result in the conversion of the sold shares into class B shares of EBA Holding having one vote per share. In addition, EBA Holdings bylaws contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions and tag-along rights. A public shareholder of Banco Galicia, who indirectly owns approximately 4.5% of the outstanding capital stock of Banco Galicia, has granted a right of first refusal for the purchase of all or part of its shares to certain of our controlling shareholders in the event such public shareholder decides to sell all or part of its Banco Galicia shares. As of March 31, 2008, we had 49 identified United States record shareholders (not considering The Bank of New York), of which 26 held our class B shares and 23 held our ADSs. Such United States holders, in the aggregate, held approximately 55.2 million of our class B shares, representing approximately 4.5% of our total outstanding capital stock as of said date. -192- Table of Contents Related Party Transactions Other than as set forth below, Grupo Financiero Galicia and its non-banking subsidiaries are not a party to any transactions with, and have not made any loans to any (i) enterprises that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, control or are controlled by Grupo Financiero Galicia or its non-banking subsidiaries, (ii) associates (i.e. an unconsolidated enterprise in which Grupo Financiero Galicia or its non-banking subsidiaries has a significant influence or which has significant influence over Grupo Financiero Galicia or its non-banking subsidiaries), (iii) individuals owning, directly or indirectly, an interest in the voting power of Grupo Financiero Galicia or its non-banking subsidiaries that gives them significant influence over Grupo Financiero Galicia or its non-banking subsidiaries, as applicable, and close members of any such individuals family (i.e. those family members that may be expected to influence, or be influenced by, that person in their dealings with Grupo Financiero Galicia or its non-banking subsidiaries, as applicable), (iv) key management personnel (i.e. persons that have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of Grupo Financiero Galicia or its non-banking subsidiaries, including directors and senior management of companies and close members of such individuals family) or (v) enterprises in which a substantial interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by any person described in (iii) or (iv) or over which such a person is able to exercise significant influence nor are there any proposed transactions with such persons.
