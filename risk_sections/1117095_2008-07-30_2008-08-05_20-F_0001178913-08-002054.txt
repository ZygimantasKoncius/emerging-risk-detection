D. Risk Factors We believe that the occurrence of any one or some combination of the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks relating to our business We currently conduct no significant business activities. In July 2008, we acquired a minority stake in BioCancell Therapeutics, Inc., an Israel-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. Other than our involvement in the management of BioCancell, we do not currently conduct any significant operations. The growth of our business depends on our obtaining additional financing, which may be unavailable to us. In order to acquire stakes in additional operating companies, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. In addition, we may need to raise funds in order to help finance companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. For example, we provided $2.5 million to BioCancell in July 2008 and, if BioCancells development proceeds as planned, we will likely provide it with additional funds in 2009. We also hold a five-year warrant to purchase shares of BioCancell, for an aggregate exercise price of approximately $3.0 million. If we do not raise additional funds, we may not be able to provide BioCancell with the support it requires and we may not be able to acquire stakes in additional operating companies. We may be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all, which would harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not consummate transactions with additional operating companies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying and evaluating suitable business opportunities or in consummating transactions with additional operating companies. No particular industry or specific business within an industry has been selected for target companies. Accordingly, we may enter into a transaction with a business entity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential for immediate earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics. In the event that we complete a transaction with one or more operating companies, the success of our operations will be dependent upon the management of such target company or companies and numerous other factors. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate additional transactions on terms favorable to us, or at all. We may be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Following the sale of our business to STMicroelectronics in April 2003 and the investment of the cash proceeds of the sale, we may be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, unless we qualify for an exemption. The likelihood of being deemed to be an investment company increases over time if we do not enter into a business combination or develop an operating business. Even if we acquire minority stakes in one or more operating companies, we may be deemed an investment company if we do not have sufficient control over such companies or qualify for another exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we are deemed an investment company, we could be found to be in violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940. A violation of that law could make it more difficult for us to register securities and raise funding and subject us to other material adverse consequences. 4 Our shareholders may be subject to dilution of the value of our shares if we conduct a business combination or other type of acquisition. A business combination or the acquisition of stakes in operating companies, which are among the business alternatives considered by us, may involve the issuance of a significant number of additional shares. Depending upon the value of the assets acquired in such transaction, the per share value of our ordinary shares may increase or decrease, perhaps significantly. We may face tax liabilities relating to our asset sales. We have generated a significant amount of income from the sale of the ASIC business of Silicon Value in 2001 and our various agreements with STMicroelectronics in 2002 to 2003. Based on our assessment and that of our tax advisors, we believe that we have fully satisfied all tax due in relation with these transactions. The tax authorities may not agree with our view. Any such disagreement and subsequent tax dispute could result in tax liabilities in amounts which we currently can not estimate. We might lose money from the investment of our cash. We invest the majority of our cash on hand in a variety of financial instruments. If the obligor of any of the instruments we hold defaults or undergoes a reorganization in bankruptcy, we may lose all or a portion of our investment. This would harm our financial condition. For information on the types of our investments as of December 31, 2007, see Item 11  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk Management. We are subject to costs and risks associated with complying with extensive corporate governance and disclosure requirements. As a foreign private issuer subject to U.S. federal securities laws, we are required to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and various SEC regulations. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires managements annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these controls by our management and, commencing from fiscal year 2009, by our independent registered public accounting firm. There is no guarantee that these efforts will result in management assurance or an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that our internal control over financial reporting is adequate in future periods. If we complete a business combination, we will likely need to invest additional time and resources in connection with our compliance with Section 404 and the other applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to assure that we continue to comply with these requirements. The additional management attention and costs relating to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other corporate governance requirements could materially and adversely affect our financial results. 5 Risks relating to our holdings in BioCancell We provided $2.5 million of funding to BioCancell, an Israel-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, whose future is uncertain. Our success is now dependent to a significant degree on the success of BioCancell. We have provided $2.5 million of funding to BioCancell and designated a member of its board of directors, and we may provide BioCancell with additional funding in the future. BioCancell is developing new drugs for the treatment of various types of cancer. To be profitable, BioCancell must successfully research, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and distribute its drugs. The path necessary to achieve these goals for any drug product is long and uncertain. Before BioCancell can sell any drug, it will be required to demonstrate through clinical trials that it is safe and effective for human use in the treatment of individuals with cancer. Neither BioCancell nor its senior management has ever successfully commercialized a drug product and no assurance can be given that BioCancell will be able to successfully complete the clinical trials for its drugs in development in accordance with the standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration, or the FDA, or if it is able, that its drugs will prove to be safe and will produce the intended effects. If BioCancell does not successfully meet its scientific, regulatory, financial and commercial challenges, then the value of our investment in BioCancell may significantly decline and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially harmed. BioCancell will require additional funding, which may further draw on our resources or result in significant dilution of our ownership. BioCancell is expected to need additional funding for its operations in 2009 and may not be able to raise such funds without our participation. It is likely that we will allocate additional funds to support BioCancell in 2009, in which case our cash reserves will decline and the dependence of our results on the results of BioCancell will increase. If we do not allocate additional funds to BioCancell, our holding in BioCancell would be diluted, our influence over its business could weaken and the value of our holding could materially decline. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology market is highly competitive. If BioCancell is unable to compete effectively with existing products, new treatment methods and new technologies, it may be unable to commercialize any therapeutic products that it may develop. The biotechnology market is highly competitive, is subject to rapid technological change and is significantly affected by existing rival drugs and medical procedures, new product introductions and the market activities of other participants. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations pursue the research and development of technologies and drugs for the treatment of some or all of the diseases that BioCancell is targeting, including superficial bladder carcinoma, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. A significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. The competitors of BioCancell may develop products more rapidly or more effectively than BioCancell. They have: much greater experience and much greater financial, technical and human resources than BioCancell; more extensive experience in pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and in manufacturing and marketing therapeutic products; products that have been approved or are in late stages of development; established distribution networks; and entrenched and established relationships with healthcare providers and payors. As a result of any of the foregoing factors, the competitors of BioCancell may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any therapeutic products that it develops. The competitors of BioCancell therefore may be more successful in commercializing their products than BioCancell, which could adversely affect its competitive position and harm its business prospects. 6 BioCancell is exposed to a risk of substantial loss due to claims that may be filed against it in the future because BioCancell does not maintain insurance policies to cover the risk of loss associated with its operations. BioCancell is exposed to the risk of having claims seeking monetary damages being filed against it for loss or harm suffered by participants of its clinical studies or for loss or harm suffered by users of any drug that may receive approval for commercialization in the future. In either event, the FDA or the regulatory authorities of other countries or regions may commence investigations of the safety and effectiveness of any such clinical trial or commercialized drug, as well as the manufacturing processes and facilities or marketing programs utilized in respect of any such trial or drug. Such investigations may result in mandatory or voluntary recalls of any commercialized drug or other significant enforcement action, such as limiting the indications for which any such drug may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approval for any such drug. Investigations by the FDA or any other regulatory authority in other countries or regions also could delay or prevent the completion of any of BioCancells other clinical development programs. In the event that BioCancell is required to pay damages for any such claim, it may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection or to liquidate because its asset and revenue base may be insufficient to satisfy the payment of damages, and insurance, if any, that it obtained or may obtain for product or clinical trial liability may not provide sufficient coverage against its liabilities. BioCancells exclusive license to certain patents will expire in 2017, and BioCancell may face increased competition from third parties who will be able to license the patents that BioCancell has used in its research and development activities. Certain patents underlying the exclusive license that Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, or Yissum, has granted to BioCancell will expire beginning in 2017, after which time, any one or more of BioCancells competitors could develop generic alternatives to BioCancells prospective drugs. Such competitors may have greater resources and marketing potential than BioCancell, and the commercialization of a generic alternative would likely drive down the price that BioCancell is able to charge for its products. This would materially harm BioCancells results of operations. In addition, unless BioCancell is successful in extending the patent protection on its drugs beyond 2017, the value of BioCancells drugs from FDA approval of its drugs to market through 2017 may not commercially support the risks involved and expenses required to conclude FDA-approved clinical trials, thus resulting in an early termination of the development of its drugs. BioCancell is required, and may be required in the future, to license patent rights from third party owners in order to develop its prospective therapeutic products in the future. If BioCancell cannot obtain and comply with the terms of such licenses or if such owners do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, BioCancells competitive position and business prospects will be harmed. BioCancell currently licenses technologies and other patents from third parties for use in conducting its research and development activities and it may be required to obtain additional licenses in the future in the event that it believes it is necessary or useful for its business and its research and development efforts to use third party intellectual property or if its efforts would otherwise infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. 7 Additionally, should BioCancell succeed in obtaining any such license, its business prospects will depend in part on the ability of its licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for its licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents for which BioCancell secured exclusive rights, such as the exclusive license granted to BioCancell by Yissum in connection with its research on the H19 gene. If BioCancell were to breach any of its obligations under any such license, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. In addition, BioCancells licensors may fail to successfully prosecute or may fail to maintain their patent applications which they license to BioCancell, or, contrary to the view of BioCancell, may determine not to pursue litigation against other persons that are infringing these patents or, contrary to the view of BioCancell, may pursue such litigation less aggressively than BioCancell would. Without protection for the intellectual property that BioCancell has licensed and for which it may obtain licenses in the future, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect BioCancells competitive position and harm its business prospects. If BioCancell is not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for its inventions, its ability to develop and commercialize its prospective therapeutic products will be harmed. BioCancells success depends, to a considerable extent, on its ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that it develops under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, so that it may prevent others from unlawfully using its inventions and proprietary information. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including BioCancell, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and may change. There also is no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. Even if BioCancells rights are not directly challenged, disputes among third parties could lead to the weakening or invalidation of its intellectual property rights. Accordingly, BioCancell does not know the degree of future protection for its proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed with respect to any patents issued to it or to others. Additionally, the mere issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable against third parties. A third party may sue BioCancell for infringing its patent rights. Likewise, BioCancell may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to it or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights. In addition, a third party may claim that BioCancell has improperly obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information. The cost to BioCancell of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in its favor, could be significant, and the litigation would divert its managements efforts. From a financial perspective, there is a risk that BioCancell would not be able to sustain the costs of any such litigation and would be forced to seek bankruptcy protection or to liquidate because of its limited asset and revenue base. 8 BioCancell relies on one primary source and a limited number of third parties for the supply of certain major components for its drugs and other raw materials required for its research and development activities. If BioCancell is unable to reach agreements with these third parties or if it is unable to maintain its contractual relationships with these third parties, BioCancells research and development activities would be delayed. BioCancell relies on third parties for the provision of materials required for its research and development activities. Obtaining these materials requires various approvals as well as reaching a commercial agreement on acceptable terms with the provider of the materials. BioCancell may not be able to reach agreements with a sufficient number of suppliers or do so on terms acceptable to it. If BioCancell is unable to reach acceptable agreements with a sufficient number of suppliers of research materials, its research and development activities will be delayed and its ability to implement its business plan will be compromised. If BioCancell is unable to retain Professor Abraham Hochberg, Dr. Patricia Ohana and other qualified key management and scientists, staff consultants and advisors, its ability to implement its business plan may be adversely affected. BioCancells success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of certain of its senior management. The loss of the service of any of these persons, including Professor Abraham Hochberg its Co-Founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Scientific Officer, and Dr. Patricia Ohana, may significantly delay or prevent BioCancells achievement of product development and its other business objectives. Should either of Professor Hochberg or Dr. Ohana cease his or her employment with BioCancell or should BioCancell otherwise lose his or her services, its ability to conduct its research and development activities would be significantly compromised. BioCancells employment agreements with its key personnel, including Professor Abraham Hochberg and Dr. Patricia Ohana, are terminable by the employee upon the provision of 90 days or three months advance written notice to BioCancell. BioCancell does not carry key man life insurance on any of its executive officers or other key employees. Risks relating to our presence in Israel Our incorporation in Israel may limit our ability to find a target for a business combination or other transactions outside Israel. We are incorporated and headquartered in Israel, and BioCancell is headquartered in Israel. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Ongoing violence between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as tension between Israel, Iran, Syria and Lebanon, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. We cannot predict the effect on us of the increase in the degree of terror attacks against Israel, political instability in the region or military action elsewhere in the Middle East. Furthermore, several countries restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional companies may restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies as a result of an increase in hostilities. 9 It may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us, our officers and directors or to assert U.S. securities law claims in Israel. Service of process upon our directors and officers named herein may be difficult to effect within the United States because some of these people reside outside the United States. Any judgment obtained in the United States against us or these individuals or entities may not be enforceable within the United States. It may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if any Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing these matters. Subject to specified time limitations and legal procedures, under the rules of private international law currently prevailing in Israel, Israeli courts may enforce a U.S. final judgment in a civil matter, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws and including a monetary or compensatory judgment in a non-civil matter, provided that:  the judgment is enforceable in the state in which it was given;  adequate service of process has been effected and the defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to be heard;  the judgment and its enforcement are not contrary to the law, public policy, security or sovereignty of the State of Israel;  the judgment was not obtained by fraud and does not conflict with any other valid judgment in the same matter between the same parties; and  an action between the same parties in the same matter is not pending in any Israeli court at the time the lawsuit is instituted in the U.S. court. If a foreign judgment is enforced by an Israeli court, it generally will be payable in new Israeli shekels, which can then be converted into non-Israeli currency and transferred out of Israel. The usual practice in an action to recover an amount in non-Israeli currency is for the Israeli court to render judgment for the equivalent amount in new Israeli shekels at the rate of exchange on the date of payment, but the judgment debtor also may make payment in non-Israeli currency. Pending collection, the amount of the judgment of an Israeli court stated in new Israeli shekels ordinarily will be linked to the Israel Consumer Price Index plus interest at the annual rate (set by Israeli law) prevailing at that time. Judgment creditors bear the risk of unfavorable exchange rates. 10 Provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger or other business combination, which may depress out share price. Provisions of Israeli corporate law may have the effect of delaying, preventing or making more difficult a merger with, or acquisition of, us. The Israeli Companies Law generally provides that a merger be approved by the board of directors and a majority of the shares present and voting on the proposed merger. For purposes of the shareholder vote, unless a court rules otherwise, the merger will not be deemed approved if a majority of the shares not held by the other party to the merger (or by any person who holds 25% or more of the shares or the right to appoint 25% or more of the directors of the other party or its general manager) have voted against the merger. Upon the request of any creditor of a party to the proposed merger, a court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there is a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will be unable to satisfy the obligations of the surviving company. Finally, a merger may not be completed unless at least (i) 50 days have passed since the filing of a merger proposal signed by both parties with the Israeli Registrar of Companies and (ii) 30 days have passed since the merger was approved by the shareholders of each merging company. The Companies Law also provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a 25% or greater shareholder of the company, unless there is already another 25% or greater shareholder of the company. Similarly, an acquisition of shares must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a 45% or greater shareholder of the company, unless there is already a 45% or greater shareholder of the company. In any event, if as a result of an acquisition of shares the acquirer will hold more than 90% of a companys shares, the acquisition must be made by means of a tender offer for all of the shares. Finally, Israel tax law treats some acquisitions, such as stock-for-stock exchanges between an Israeli company and a foreign company, less favorably than U.S. tax laws. For example, Israeli tax law may, under certain circumstances, subject a shareholder who exchanges his ordinary shares for shares in another corporation, to taxation prior to the sale of the shares received in such stock-for-stock swap. The described restrictions could prevent or make more difficult an acquisition of Tikcro, which could depress our share price. Risks relating to the market for our ordinary shares Holders of our ordinary shares who are U.S. residents face income tax risks. As a consequence of our ownership of substantial cash and investment assets but no operating business assets, it is likely that we would be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having been a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, during each of 2005, 2006 and 2007. We could also be classified as a PFIC for 2008, although the determination of PFIC status is made separately for each year and our PFIC status could change. Classification as a PFIC could result in a reduction in the after-tax return to U.S. holders of our ordinary shares, which could, in turn, cause a reduction in the value of our ordinary shares. Classification as a PFIC also triggers the application of certain United States tax reporting requirements. 11 Complex rules apply to a U.S. holder of our ordinary shares if we are treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any year during such U.S. holders holding period. Accordingly, U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules. U.S. residents should carefully read Item 10.E Taxation  United States Federal Income Tax Consequences for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax risks related to owning and disposing of our ordinary shares and the consequences of PFIC status. The trading market for our ordinary shares has low liquidity, which could make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares at desired prices and amounts. Our ordinary shares currently are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic quotation medium regulated by the National Association of Securities Dealers. Currently, we do not meet the initial listing conditions of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The market for shares quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is typically less liquid than that for shares listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. This could make it more difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares at desired prices and amounts. Two shareholders may be able to control us. Izhak Tamir and Eric Paneth, directors of Tikcro, each beneficially own approximately 12.5% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Currently, Messrs. Paneth and Tamir are not party to a shareholders agreement. However, if Messrs. Paneth and Tamir act together, they effectively may have the power to control the outcome of all matters submitted for the vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of significant change in control transactions. Their combined equity interest in us may have the effect of making certain transactions more difficult and may result in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Tikcro unless approved by one or both of them. Our shareholder bonus rights plan may delay, prevent or make more difficult a hostile acquisition of Tikcro, which could depress our share price. In September 2005, we adopted a shareholder bonus rights plan pursuant to which share purchase bonus rights were distributed to our shareholders. These rights generally will be exercisable and transferable apart from our ordinary shares only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our ordinary shares, or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which that person or group would hold such a beneficial interest. Once these rights become exercisable and transferable, the holders of rights, other than the person or group triggering their transferability, will be generally entitled to purchase our ordinary shares at a discount from the market price. The rights will expire on December 31, 2015. While these rights remain outstanding, they may make an acquisition of us more difficult and result in delaying or preventing a change in control of Tikcro. 12
