Item 1A. Risk Factors (continued) - -------- ------------------------ New Products ------------ The successful operation of the Company depends on its ability to anticipate market needs and develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis. The Company must continue to develop leading-edge products and introduce them to the market quickly in order to be successful. The Company's failure to produce technologically competitive products in a cost-effective manner and on a timely basis could harm the business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company believes the products it is making under its new contracts with the U.S. Navy are new technologies that respond to market needs. Financial Results ----------------- As more fully discussed under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"), the Company is in a transitional phase between the end of its long-term AN/APM-480 contract and the commencement of deliveries under its new multi-year AN/USM-708 contract. As a result, revenues declined in 2007 and the Company sustained a loss. However, at March 31, 2007, new contracts and new orders have significantly increased the backlog over the last fiscal year, and management believes working capital is adequate to fund its plans over the next year (see Management's Discussion and Analysis). Deliveries under CRAFT and ITATS should commence in late calendar year 2008. Financial results are dependent upon delivery of its new products in a timely and compliant manner. The Company expects to meet its commitment. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments - -------- ------------------------- None.
