The Corporation, through its subsidiary bank, offers a full range of commercial banking services. These banking services include deposits, business and personal checking accounts, savings and individual retirement accounts, time deposit instruments, electronically accessed banking products, residential and commercial real estate financing, commercial lending, consumer financing, debit cards, safe deposit box services, money transfer services, automated teller machines, access to insurance products and corporate and personal trust and investment management services. The principal markets for the Corporations commercial banking services are communities within Michigan in which the Corporations subsidiary bank branches are located and the areas immediately surrounding those communities. As of December 31, 2006, the Corporation operated through one subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank, headquartered in Midland, Michigan, serving 89 communities through 127 banking offices and 1 loan production office located in 31 counties across Michigans lower peninsula. In addition to its banking offices, the Corporation operated 137 automated teller machines, both on- and off-bank premises. On December 31, 2005, a corporate internal consolidation was completed resulting in the consolidation of the Corporations three commercial bank charters into one commercial subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank. The Corporations sole subsidiary bank continues to operate through an organizational structure of community banks. The principal source of revenue for the Corporation is interest and fees on loans, which accounted for 72% of total revenues in 2006, 69% of total revenues in 2005 and 67% of total revenues in 2004. Interest on investment securities is also a significant source of revenue, accounting for 10% of total revenues in 2006, 13% of total revenues in 2005 and 15% of total revenues in 2004. Business volumes tend to be influenced by overall economic factors including market interest rates, business and consumer spending, and consumer confidence, as well as competitive conditions in the marketplace. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS The following discussion and analysis is intended to cover the significant factors affecting the Corporations consolidated statements of financial position and income included in this report. It is designed to provide shareholders with a more comprehensive review of the consolidated operating results and financial position of the Corporation than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value on the financial statements warrants an impairment write-down or a valuation reserve to be established. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated by management primarily through the use of internal discounted cash flow analysis. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Corporation are presented in Note A to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other notes to the consolidated financial statements and in Managements Discussion and Analysis, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates and assumptions underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, pension plan accounting, income and other taxes, capitalization and valuation of real estate mortgage loan servicing rights, and the evaluation of goodwill impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such, could be most subject to revision as new continued on next page 3 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) or additional information becomes available or circumstances change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb inherent loan losses of the loan portfolio. The loan portfolio represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statements of financial position. The determination of the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans and on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The principal assumption used in deriving the allowance is the estimate of a loss percentage for each type of loan. It is extremely difficult to precisely measure the amount of losses that are inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio. The Corporation uses a rigorous process to accurately quantify the necessary allowance and related provision for loan losses, but there can be no assurance that the modeling process will successfully identify and estimate all of the losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. As a result, the Corporation could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that have been recorded in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. Note A to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance. In addition, a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance is included under the subheading Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Pension Plan Accounting The Corporation has a defined benefit pension plan for certain salaried employees. Effective June 30, 2006, benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were frozen for approximately two-thirds of the Corporations salaried employees. Pension benefits continued unchanged for the remaining salaried employees. The Corporations pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts and measurements. Benefits under the plan are based on years of vested service, age and compensation. Assumptions are made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and pension expense. The key actuarial assumptions used in the pension plan are the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic pension expense, as well as the respective benefit obligation amounts. The Corporation evaluates these critical assumptions annually. At December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the Corporation calculated the discount rate for the pension plan using the results from a bond matching technique, which matched cash flows of the pension plan against both a bond portfolio derived from the S&P bond database of AA or better bonds and the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve, to determine the discount rate. As of December 31, 2006, the discount rate was established at 6.0% to reflect market interest rate conditions. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting primarily of equities and fixed income investments. When determining the expected long-term return on pension plan assets, the Corporation considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes in which the Corporation expects the pension funds to be invested. The expected long-term rate of return is based on both historical and forecasted returns of the overall stock and bond markets and the actual portfolio. The Corporation reduced its projection of forecasted returns on the portfolio of pension plan assets during 2006. The following rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the long-term return on pension plan assets assumption: December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006 December 31, 2004 Equity securities 8%  9% 9%  10% Debt securities 4%  6% 5%  7% Other 3%  5% 3%  5% 4 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The long-term return on pension plan assets is used to compute the subsequent years expected return on assets, using the market-related value of pension plan assets. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension plan assets during the year is either an asset gain or loss, which may be deferred and amortized over future periods when determining net periodic pension expense. The actual average annual return on pension plan assets was 6.8% over the ten years ended December 31, 2006. Other assumptions made in the pension plan involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality turnover and the rate of compensation increase. The key actuarial assumptions that will be used to calculate 2007 pension expense for the defined benefit pension plan are a discount rate of 6.0%, a long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.0% and a rate of compensation increase of 4.25%. Pension expense in 2007 is expected to be approximately $1.0 million, a decrease of $0.9 million from $1.9 million of pension expense in 2006. The projected decrease in 2007, compared to 2006, is mostly attributable to the partial freeze of the pension plan during 2006 and an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of the pension plans obligations. A change in the discount rate of fifty basis points in 2007 was estimated to have an impact on pension expense of $0.25 million. There are uncertainties associated with the underlying key actuarial assumptions, and the potential exists for significant, and possibly material, impacts on either the results of operations or cash flows (e.g., additional pension expense and/or additional pension plan funding, whether expected or required) from changes in the key actuarial assumptions. If the Corporation were to determine that more conservative assumptions are necessary, pension expense would increase and have a negative impact on results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). The Corporation adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, as required. The purpose of SFAS 158 is to improve the overall financial statement presentation of pension and other postretirement plans, but does not impact the determination of the net periodic benefit cost or measurement of plan assets or obligations. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the over- or under-funded status of a plan as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The impact of the adoption of SFAS 158 on the statement of financial position at December 31, 2006 is summarized in Note L to the consolidated financial statements. Income and Other Taxes The Corporation is subject to the income and other tax laws of the United States and the state of Michigan. These laws are complex and are subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. In determining the provisions for income and other taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws, related regulations and case law. In the process of preparing the Corporations tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on managements ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law. The Corporation and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for federal income taxes is based on income and expenses, as reported in the consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on the Corporations federal income tax return. When income and expenses are recognized in different periods for tax purposes than for book purposes, applicable deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective federal and state tax rates based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on an annual basis, or sooner, if business events or circumstances warrant. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are reviewed continued on next page 5 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, net federal income tax benefits of $0.23 million and $0.94 million, respectively, were recorded based on the regular reassessment of required tax accruals for these uncertain tax positions. No such tax benefits were recorded in 2004. Real Estate Mortgage Loan Servicing Rights At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had approximately $2.4 million of real estate mortgage loan servicing rights capitalized on the consolidated statement of financial position. The two critical assumptions involved in establishing the value of this asset are the estimated future prepayment speeds on the underlying real estate mortgage loans and the interest rate used to discount the net cash flows from the real estate mortgage loan portfolio being serviced. Other assumptions include the estimated amount of ancillary income that will be received in the future (such as late fees) and the estimated cost to service the real estate mortgage loans. The Corporation utilizes a third-party modeling software program to value mortgage servicing rights. The Corporation believes the assumptions utilized in the valuation are reasonable based upon market interest rates and accepted industry practices for valuing mortgage servicing rights and represent neither the most conservative nor the most aggressive assumptions. Goodwill At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had $70.1 million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position. Goodwill increased $6.8 million during 2006 from the acquisition of two branch banking offices. Under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), amortization of goodwill ceased, and instead, goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The Corporations goodwill impairment review is performed at least annually by management and additionally assessed by an independent third-party appraisal firm utilizing the methodology and guidelines established in SFAS 142. This methodology involved assumptions regarding the valuation of the Corporations subsidiary bank that purchased the acquired entities and resulted in the recording of goodwill. The Corporation believes that the assumptions utilized are reasonable, and even utilizing more conservative assumptions on the valuation would not presently result in impairment in the amount of goodwill that has been recorded. However, the Corporation may incur impairment charges related to goodwill in the future due to changes in business prospects or other matters that could affect the valuation assumptions. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS The Corporations primary method of expansion into new banking markets has been through acquisitions of other financial institutions and bank branches. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, the Corporation completed the following acquisition: In August 2006, the Corporation acquired two branch bank offices in Hastings and Wayland, Michigan from First Financial Bank, N.A., headquartered in Hamilton, Ohio, operating as Sand Ridge Bank. The Corporation acquired deposits of $47 million, loans of $64 million and other miscellaneous assets of $1.7 million. The Corporation recorded goodwill of $6.8 million, including purchase accounting adjustments of $2.5 million, and core deposit intangible assets of $2.7 million. The core deposit intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over ten years, with $0.2 million of amortization expense recognized in 2006. The loans acquired were comprised of $6 million in commercial loans, $13 million in real estate commercial loans, $38 million in real estate residential loans and $7 million in consumer loans. During December 2006, the Corporation sold $14 million of long-term fixed interest rate real estate residential loans that were acquired in this transaction and recognized gains totaling approximately $1 million. On December 31, 2005, the Corporation completed an internal consolidation whereby two of its wholly-owned subsidiary banks, Chemical Bank Shoreline and Chemical Bank West, were consolidated into Chemical Bank and Trust Company (CBT). CBTs name was changed to Chemical Bank on December 31, 2005. 6 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS NET INCOME Net income in 2006 was $46.8 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, net income in 2005 was $52.9 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, and net income in 2004 was $56.7 million, or $2.25 per diluted share. Net income in 2006 represented an 11.4% decrease from 2005 net income, while 2005 net income represented a 6.7% decrease from 2004 net income. Net income per share in 2006 was 10.5% less than in 2005, while net income per share in 2005 was 6.7% less than in 2004. The decreases in net income in both 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to decreases in net interest income. The Corporations return on average assets was 1.24% in 2006, 1.40% in 2005 and 1.47% in 2004. The Corporations return on average shareholders equity was 9.2% in 2006, 10.7% in 2005 and 12.0% in 2004. DEPOSITS Total deposits at December 31, 2006 were $2.90 billion, an increase of $78 million, or 2.8%, over total deposits at December 31, 2005 of $2.82 billion. The increase in total deposits was largely attributable to the acquisition of two branch banking offices from First Financial Bank, N.A. in Hastings and Wayland, Michigan in August 2006. The acquisition added total deposits of $47 million. The Corporations average deposit balances and average rates paid on deposits for the past three years are included in Table 1. Average total deposits in 2006 were $2.86 billion, $24 million, or 0.8%, lower than in 2005. Average deposits of $2.89 billion in 2005 were $90 million, or 3.0%, less than in 2004. The decreases in average deposits in 2006 and 2005, compared to the prior year, were primarily attributable to declines in consumer deposits that resulted from intense competition in the marketplace for retail deposits. The Corporation did not have any brokered deposits as of December 31, 2006, compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2005. It is the Corporations strategy to develop customer relationships that will drive core deposit growth and stability. The Corporation has historically gathered deposits from the local markets of its subsidiary bank, although rising market interest rates and strong competition impeded the Corporations ability to internally generate deposits during the three years ended December 31, 2006. The growth of the Corporations deposits is also impacted by competition from other investment products, such as brokerage accounts, mutual funds and various annuity products. These investment products are sold by a wide spectrum of organizations, such as brokerage and insurance companies, as well as by financial institutions. The Corporation also competes with credit unions in most of its markets. These institutions are challenging competitors, as credit unions are exempt from federal income taxes, allowing them to potentially offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates to customers. In response to the competition for other investment products, the Corporations subsidiary bank, through CFC Investment Center, offers a wide array of mutual funds, annuity products and market securities through an alliance with an independent, registered broker/dealer. During 2006 and 2005, customers purchased $73 million and $52 million, respectively, of annuity and mutual fund investments through CFC Investment Center. ASSETS Average assets were $3.76 billion during 2006, a decrease of $25.4 million, or 0.7%, from average assets during 2005 of $3.79 billion. The decrease in average assets during 2006 was primarily attributable to the utilization of available liquidity resulting from a portion of investment securities maturities to pay off a portion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances  long-term that matured during 2006. The Corporation acquired two branch banking offices on August 18, 2006, increasing total assets by $73.3 million as of the acquisition date. Average assets of $3.86 billion in 2005 were $67.6 million, or 1.8%, less than average assets in 2004. Average assets declined in 2005 due to the Corporation utilizing a portion of investment securities maturities to fund a slight decline in total deposits. 7 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CASH DIVIDENDS The Corporations annual cash dividends paid per share over the past five years, adjusted for all stock dividends, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Annual Dividend $ 1.10 $ 1.06 $ 1.01 $ 0.95 $ 0.87 During 2006, cash dividends paid per share of $1.10 were up 3.8% over cash dividends paid per share in 2005 of $1.06. The Corporation has paid regular cash dividends every quarter since it began operating as a bank holding company in 1973. The compound annual growth rate of the Corporations cash dividends paid per share over the past five- and ten-year periods ended December 31, 2006 was 5.8% and 8.7%, respectively. The earnings of the Corporations subsidiary bank are the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders. Cash dividends are dependent upon the earnings of the Corporations subsidiary bank, as well as capital requirements, regulatory restraints and other factors affecting the Corporations subsidiary bank. NET INTEREST INCOME Interest income is the total amount earned on funds invested in loans, investment and other securities, other interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. Interest expense is the amount of interest paid on interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, time deposits, short-term borrowings and FHLB advances  long-term. Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, is the difference between interest income and interest expense adjusted for the tax benefit received on tax-exempt commercial loans and investment securities. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income (FTE) by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, or free funds (principally demand deposits and shareholders equity) also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the net interest spread. The presentation of net interest income on a FTE basis is not in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) but is customary in the banking industry. This non-GAAP measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investment securities. The adjustments to determine tax equivalent net interest income were $2.11 million, $1.61 million and $1.54 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These adjustments were computed using a 35% tax rate. Net interest income is the most important source of the Corporations earnings and thus is critical in evaluating the results of operations. Changes in the Corporations net interest income are influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in the level of interest-earning assets, changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the level and direction of interest rates, the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates (the steepness of the yield curve), and the general strength of the economies in the Corporations markets. Risk management plays an important role in the Corporations level of net interest income. The ineffective management of credit risk, and more significantly interest rate risk, can adversely impact the Corporations net interest income. Management monitors the Corporations consolidated statement of financial position to reduce the potential adverse impact on net interest income caused by significant changes in interest rates.

Table 1 presents for 2006, 2005 and 2004 average daily balances of the Corporations major categories of assets and liabilities, interest income and expense on a FTE basis, average interest rates earned and paid on the assets and liabilities, net interest income (FTE), net interest spread and net interest margin. Net interest income (FTE) in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $134.3 million, $143.5 million and $149.2 million, respectively. Net interest income (FTE) in 2006 was $9.1 million, or 6.4%, lower than 2005 net interest income (FTE) of $143.5 million, while net interest income (FTE) in 2005 was $5.7 million, or 3.8%, lower than 2004 net interest income (FTE) of $149.2 million. The decreases in net interest income in 2006 and 2005 were primarily attributable to the continuing effect of the interest rate environment, lower interest-earning assets, funds migrating within the deposit portfolio from lower cost transaction and savings accounts to higher cost savings and time deposits and continued pricing pressure on loans. continued on next page 9 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS NET INTEREST INCOME (CONTINUED) TABLE 2.

(2) The change in interest income and interest expense due to both volume and rate has been allocated to the volume and rate change in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. The $9.1 million decrease in net interest income (FTE) during 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to a combination of the adverse impact of the increase in short-term interest rates and the flat interest yield curve on interest expense on deposits and short-term borrowings, a $29 million decrease in average interest-earning assets between 2006 and 2005 and changes in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities from lower cost transaction and savings deposits to higher cost time and municipal customer deposits. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets and a positive change in the mix of interest-earning assets, with average loans up $126 million, or 4.8%, in 2006, as compared to 2005. The reduction in average interest-earning assets during 2006 was primarily attributable to a reduction in investment securities. The Corporations investment securities portfolio declined partially as investment securities maturities were used to decrease Federal Home Loan Bank advances  long-term. In 2006, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the Discount and Federal Funds rates by twenty-five basis points four times during the year that did result in an equal increase each time in the prime rate. The Discount and Federal Funds rates were 5.25% on December 31, 2006, compared to 4.25% on December 31, 2005. The prime rate was 8.25% on December 31, 2006, compared to 7.25% on December 31, 2005. While short-term interest rates increased throughout 2006, long-term interest rates rose only slightly to produce an inverted interest yield curve at December 31, 2006. The ten-year U.S. Treasury note, which is generally used to price both 15- and 30-year residential mortgage loans, was 4.71% at the end of 2006, compared to 4.35% at the end of 2005. Net interest margin was 3.82% in 2006, compared to 4.04% in 2005. The decrease in net interest margin during 2006, compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to the increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets not keeping pace with the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, as occurred in 2005 although to a lesser extent. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 57 basis points to 6.23% in 2006. In comparison, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 105 basis points to 3.16% in 2006. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was attributable to a combination of factors, including the overall increase in market interest rates, the migration of customer funds from lower 10 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS yielding deposit products into higher yielding time deposits and a slight change in the mix of deposits, with a slight decline in lower cost consumer deposits being offset by increases in higher cost business and municipal customer deposits. The yield on the Corporations loan portfolio has increased only moderately during a two-year period of continually rising interest rates due to the loan portfolio being comprised predominately of fixed interest rate loans or loans with interest rates fixed for at least five years. In addition, the competition for loan volume remained strong in the Corporations local markets, resulting in heightened pricing competition for new loan originations, and lower than expected yields on new and refinanced loans, considering the overall increase in market interest rates. The Corporations competitive position within many of its market areas limits its ability to materially increase deposits without adversely impacting the weighted average cost of core deposits. Accordingly, the increase in short-term market interest rates in both 2006 and 2005 and strong competition resulted in a significant increase in the average cost of deposits and wholesale borrowings, and a decrease in consumer deposits in 2006, compared to 2005. Table 2 allocates the dollar change in net interest income (FTE) between the portion attributable to changes in the average volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, and changes in average interest rates earned and paid. The $9.1 million reduction in net interest income (FTE) in 2006, as compared to 2005, is analyzed in detail in Table 2. The net impact on net interest income (FTE) in 2006 from the favorable effect of an increase in average loans and the unfavorable effect of a lower level of interest-earning assets and change in the composition of deposit accounts, was an increase in net interest income (FTE) of $1.3 million. This increase was more than offset by the Corporation experiencing a $10.4 million reduction in net interest income (FTE) due to the effect of the rising interest rate environment and the flattening of the interest yield curve. Interest income on loans, investment securities and other investable funds increased $16.4 million due to rising interest rates and the repricing of loans and investment securities, although interest expense on deposits and borrowings increased $26.8 million, as market interest rates increased and deposits and wholesale borrowings repriced in 2006. The Corporations balance sheet was liability sensitive throughout 2006, with a higher percentage of interest-bearing liabilities repricing than interest-earning assets. In 2005, the FOMC raised the Discount and Federal Funds rates by twenty-five basis points eight times that did result in an equal increase each time in the prime rate. The prime rate was 5.25% on January 1, 2005 and 7.25% on December 31, 2005. While short-term interest rates increased throughout 2005, long-term interest rates rose only slightly to produce a virtually flat interest yield curve at December 31, 2005. The ten-year U.S. Treasury note, which is generally used to price both 15- and 30-year residential mortgage loans, was 4.24% at the end of 2004 compared to 4.35% at the end of 2005. Net interest income (FTE) in 2005 was $143.5 million, $5.7 million, or 3.8%, lower than in 2004. The decline in net interest income during 2005 was primarily attributable to a slight decrease in average interest-earning assets and the effects of the significant increase in short-term interest rates and the flattening of the interest yield curve during the year. These factors were partially offset by a positive change in the mix of interest-earning assets with average loans up $73.5 million, or 2.9%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Average interest-earning assets of $3.55 billion in 2005 were down $57.5 million, or 1.6%, from 2004. The reduction in average interest-earning assets during 2005 was primarily attributable to a reduction in investment securities. A portion of investment securities maturities in 2005 were used to fund a slight decline in total deposits. Net interest margin was 4.04% in 2005, compared to 4.13% in 2004. The decrease in net interest margin in 2005 occurred as a result of the increases in the average yield on interest-earning assets not keeping pace with the increases in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. In 2005, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased 37 basis points to 5.66%, while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 63 basis points to 2.11%. Consequently, the increase in the interest yield on loans was not sufficient to offset the increase in the Corporations funding costs. Short-term market interest rates increased throughout 2005, although the yield on the Corporations loan portfolio increased only modestly as the majority of the loan portfolio was and remains comprised primarily of fixed interest rate loans. The competition for loan volume was strong in 2005 in the Corporations local markets, which resulted in lower interest rates on new and renewed loans than otherwise would have been expected. 11 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LOANS The Corporations subsidiary bank is a full-service commercial bank and, therefore, the acceptance and management of credit risk is an integral part of the Corporations business. The Corporation maintains conservative loan policies and credit underwriting standards. These standards include the granting of loans generally only within the Corporations market areas. The Corporations lending markets generally consist of small communities across the middle to southern and western sections of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The Corporation has no foreign loans or any loans to finance highly leveraged transactions. The Corporations lending philosophy is implemented through strong administrative and reporting controls at the subsidiary bank level, with additional oversight at the corporate level. The Corporation maintains a centralized independent loan review function, which monitors asset quality of the loan portfolio. The Corporations subsidiary bank has extended loans to its directors, executive officers and their affiliates. The loans were made in the ordinary course of business upon normal terms, including collateralization and interest rates prevailing at the time and did not involve more than the normal risk of repayment by the borrower or present other unfavorable features. Note F to the consolidated financial statements includes more information on loans to the Corporations directors, executive officers and their affiliates. The Corporation experiences competition for commercial loans primarily from larger regional banks located both within and outside of the Corporations market areas, and from other community banks located within the Corporations lending markets. The Corporations competition for real estate residential loans primarily includes community banks, larger regional banks, savings associations, credit unions and mortgage companies. The competition for real estate residential loans has increased over the last five years as mortgage lending companies have expanded their sales and marketing efforts. The Corporation experiences competition for consumer loans mostly from captive automobile finance companies, larger regional banks, community banks and local credit unions. The Corporations loan portfolio is generally diversified along industry lines and, therefore, the Corporation believes that its loan portfolio is reasonably sheltered from material adverse local economic impact. Table 3 includes the composition of the Corporations loan portfolio, by major loan category, as of December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Total loans at December 31, 2006 were $2.81 billion, an increase of $101 million, or 3.7%, over total loans at December 31, 2005. The growth in the loan portfolio was largely due to the acquisition of two branch banking offices from First Financial Bank, N.A. in Hastings and Wayland, Michigan (2006 branch transaction). The purchase added total loans of $64 million. The loans acquired were comprised of $6 million in commercial loans, $13 million in real estate commercial loans, $38 million in real estate residential loans and $7 million in consumer loans. During December 2006, the Corporation sold $14 million of the real estate residential loans that were acquired in this transaction and recognized gains totaling approximately $1 million. The numbers set forth in the following discussion include the loans generated by the acquired branches unless stated otherwise. Commercial loans totaled $545.6 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $27.7 million, or 5.4%, from total commercial loans at December 31, 2005 of $517.9 million. A portion of the increase in commercial loans during 2006 was attributable to the 2006 branch transaction. The internal growth of commercial loans was low during 2006 as a result of a slower than average economic climate within the Corporations market areas during the year. Commercial loans increased $48.9 million, or 10.4%, in 2005 from $469.0 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in commercial loans in 2005 was largely attributable to the Corporations emphasis to increase this portion of the loan portfolio. Commercial loans represented 19.4%, 19.1% and 18.2% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 12 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TABLE 3.

At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, real estate loans totaled $1.71 billion, $1.65 billion and $1.58 billion, respectively. Real estate loans increased $59.5 million, or 3.6%, in 2006. Approximately 62% of the increase in real estate loans was attributable to the 2006 branch transaction, which added $37 million in real estate loans, net of the sale of $14 million of loans sold, as discussed above. Real estate loans increased $71 million, or 4.5%, in 2005. Real estate loans as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 60.9%, 60.9% and 61.1%, respectively. Real estate commercial loans increased $21.9 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 to $726.6 million at December 31, 2006. This includes $13 million attributable to the 2006 branch transaction. Real estate commercial loans increased $6.9 million, or 1.0%, during 2005 to $704.7 million at December 31, 2005. The modest internal growth in this category of loans in 2006 and 2005 was largely due to minimal economic expansion in the majority of the Corporations community bank market areas. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, real estate commercial loans as a percentage of total loans were 25.9%, 26.0% and 27.0%, respectively. continued on next page 13 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LOANS (CONTINUED) Commercial lending and real estate commercial lending are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than one-to four-family residential lending. Such lending typically involves large loan balances concentrated in a single borrower. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the success of the operation of the related project and is typically affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the economy. The Corporation generally attempts to mitigate the risks associated with commercial lending by, among other things, lending primarily in its market areas and using conservative loan-to-value ratios in the underwriting process. Real estate construction loans are originated for both business, including land development, and residential properties. These loans generally convert to a real estate loan at the completion of the construction or development period. Real estate construction loans were $145.9 million at December 31, 2006, a decrease of $12.4 million, or 7.9%, from December 31, 2005. The decrease in real estate construction loans during 2006 was largely reflective of the economic climate within Michigan in 2006 and a corresponding reduction in business expansion and development throughout most of the Corporations community bank market areas. Real estate construction loans increased $37.5 million, or 31.0%, during 2005 from $120.9 million at December 31, 2004, as the economic climate was favorable in 2005. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, real estate construction loans as a percentage of total loans were 5.2%, 5.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Construction lending involves a higher degree of risk than one- to four-family residential lending because of the uncertainties of construction, including the possibility of costs exceeding the initial estimates and the need to obtain a tenant or purchaser of the property if it will not be owner-occupied. The Corporation generally attempts to mitigate the risks associated with construction lending by, among other things, lending primarily in its market areas, using conservative underwriting guidelines, and closely monitoring the construction process. Table 4 presents the maturity distribution of commercial, real estate commercial, and real estate construction loans. These loans represented 51% of total loans at both December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. The percentage of these loans maturing within one year was 33% at December 31, 2006, compared to 30% at December 31, 2005. The percentage of these loans maturing beyond five years remained low at 9% at both December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Of those loans with maturities beyond one year, the percentage of loans with variable interest rates was 17% at December 31, 2006, compared to 23% at December 31, 2005. The decrease in variable interest rate loans with maturities greater than one year was due to both a strong customer preference to secure fixed interest rate financing in a rising interest rate environment and equally strong competitive conditions. Real estate commercial loans are generally written as balloon-type mortgages at fixed interest rates for balloon time periods ranging from three to ten years. As of December 31, 2006, the Corporation held $129 million in commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans that had maturities extending beyond five years, with the majority of these loans having fixed interest rates. Real estate residential loans increased $50.1 million, or 6.4%, during 2006 to $835.3 million. The 2006 branch transaction added $24 million in real estate residential loans, after a portion of the loans acquired were sold in December 2006. The internal growth of real estate residential loans was low as the housing market across much of the state of Michigan was weak throughout the year. Real estate residential loans increased $27.8 million, or 3.7%, during 2005 to $785.2 million. The increase in real estate residential loans during 2005 was primarily attributable to growth in the adjustable interest rate loan type, that includes a fixed interest rate period for one, three, five or seven years. Market interest rates of this type loan decreased during 2005 making these loans more attractive to customers. The Corporation generally keeps adjustable interest rate loans in its loan portfolio, rather than selling them in the secondary mortgage market. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, real estate residential loans as a percentage of total loans were 29.8%, 29.0% and 29.4%, respectively. The Corporations real estate residential loans primarily consist of one- to four-family residential loans with original terms of less than fifteen years. The loan-to-value ratio at the time of origination is generally 80% or less. Loans with more than an 80% loan-to-value ratio generally require private mortgage insurance. 14 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TABLE 4.

The Corporation sold $118 million of long-term fixed rate real estate residential loans during 2006 in the secondary market, excluding $14 million of loans sold that were acquired in the 2006 branch transaction, compared to the sale of $111 million of real estate residential loans during 2005. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation was servicing $552 million of real estate residential loans that had been originated by the Corporation in its market areas and subsequently sold in the secondary mortgage market. At December 31, 2005, the Corporation serviced for others approximately $544 million of real estate residential loans. The loans sold from the 2006 branch transaction were sold servicing retained and account for the increase in the Corporations servicing portfolio during 2006. Consumer loans totaled $554.3 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $13.7 million, or 2.5%, from total consumer loans at December 31, 2005 of $540.6 million. Approximately $7 million of the 2006 increase was attributable to the 2006 branch transaction. Consumer loans increased $3.5 million, or 0.7%, during 2005 from $537.1 million at December 31, 2004. The minimal increases during both 2006 and 2005 were largely attributable to increased competition from captive auto finance companies on new personal vehicle loans and slow economic conditions in the Corporations market areas, as evidenced by the unemployment level in Michigan at approximately twice the national average at December 31, 2006. Consumer loans represented 19.7%, 20.0% and 20.8% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than one- to four-family residential lending because of the type and nature of the collateral. Collateral values, particularly those of automobiles, are negatively impacted by many factors, such as new car promotions, vehicle condition and a slow economy. Consumer lending collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal situations. 15 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS NONPERFORMING ASSETS A five-year history of nonperforming assets is presented in Table 5. Nonperforming assets are comprised of loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis, accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments, and other real estate and repossessed assets. There were no restructured loans at December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 or 2002. Nonaccrual loans were $20.2 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $14.6 million at December 31, 2005 and $8.4 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in nonaccrual loans in 2006 was partially attributable to the decline in the Michigan economy and the resultant level of unemployment in the state of Michigan of 7.1%, approximately twice that of the national average. Accordingly, the decline in the economic condition in Michigan has resulted in higher business and consumer delinquencies, bankruptcies and foreclosures. At December 31, 2006, eight commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction  commercial nonaccrual loans, totaling $10.4 million, comprised 51% of total nonaccrual loans as of that date. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans were 0.72% at December 31, 2006, 0.54% at December 31, 2005 and 0.32% at December 31, 2004. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $6.7 million at December 31, 2006, $5.1 million at December 31, 2005 and $1.7 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporation experienced an improvement in real estate residential past due loans 90 days or more of $0.5 million during 2006, although this reduction was offset by increases in past due loans greater than 90 days in commercial loan types of $1.3 million and consumer loans of $0.8 million. Total nonperforming loans were $26.9 million, or 0.96% of total loans, at December 31, 2006, compared to $19.7 million, or 0.73% of total loans, at December 31, 2005. As previously discussed, the level and composition of nonperforming loans were affected by economic conditions in the state of Michigan and in the Corporations local markets. Other real estate and repossessed assets totaled $8.9 million at December 31, 2006, and consisted of commercial real estate of $6.0 million, residential real estate of $2.6 million and other repossessions, mostly automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles, of $0.3 million. Other real estate and repossessed assets totaled $6.8 million at December 31, 2005, and consisted of commercial real estate of $3.8 million, residential real estate of $2.6 million and other repossessions, mostly automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles, of $0.4 million. The increase in other real estate during 2006 was primarily attributable to the foreclosure on a twelve-unit residential condominium project in Bay City, Michigan. Based on current economic conditions, the Corporation anticipates a two-year time frame to fully liquidate this property. The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when management determines it is probable that all of the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan will not be collected. The Corporation measures impairment on commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans. In most instances, the impairment is measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Impairment may also be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. Impaired loans were $19.8 million as of December 31, 2006, $9.8 million as of December 31, 2005 and $4.6 million as of December 31, 2004. All nonaccrual commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction  commercial loans, which totaled $16.4 million at December 31, 2006, met the definition of an impaired loan. The Corporation also identified loans in each of these loan types totaling $3.4 million that were in an accrual status as of December 31, 2006 that met the definition of an impaired loan. After analyzing the various components of the customer relationships and evaluating the underlying collateral of impaired loans, it was determined that the total of impaired loans requiring an allowance for loan losses was $3.8 million at December 31, 2006, $5.1 million at December 31, 2005 and $0.8 million at December 31, 2004. The allowance for loan losses on impaired loans was $0.9 million at December 31, 2006, $1.3 million at December 31, 2005 and $0.4 million at December 31, 2004. The process of measuring impaired loans and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses requires judgment and estimation, therefore the eventual outcome may differ from the estimates used on these loans. 16 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TABLE 5.

Additional interest income of $1.1 million would have been recorded during 2006 on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms. 17 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The provision for loan losses (provision) is the amount added to the allowance for loan losses (allowance) to absorb inherent loan losses (charge-offs) in the loan portfolio. A summary of the activity in the allowance for years 2006 back through 2002 is included in Table 3. Management quarterly evaluates the allowance to ensure the level is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This evaluation is based on a continuous review of the loan portfolio, both individually and by category, and includes consideration of changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience and loan loss trends, the financial condition of the borrowers, industry and geographical exposures within the portfolio, economic conditions and employment levels of the Corporations local markets, and special factors affecting business sectors. A formal evaluation of the allowance is prepared quarterly to assess the risk in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance. The Corporations loan review function is independent of the loan origination function and reviews this evaluation. The Corporations loan review function was performed by a combination of internal staff and third-party consulting firms during 2006 and 2005. Prior to 2005, the loan review function was performed solely by internal staff. Loan review performs a detailed credit quality review at least annually on large commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans, particularly focusing on loans that have deteriorated below certain levels of credit risk. The allowance provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio but that have not been specifically identified. The allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific allowances (assessed for loans that have known credit weaknesses), allowances based on assigned risk ratings, general allowances on the remainder of the loan portfolio based primarily on historical loan loss experience, and an unallocated allowance for the imprecision in the subjective nature of the specific and general allowance methodology. Factors contributing to the determination of specific allocations include the financial condition of the borrower, changes in the value of pledged collateral and general economic conditions. The Corporation establishes the allowance allocations by the application of projected loss percentages to adversely-graded commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans by grade categories. General allowances are allocated to all other loans by loan category, based on a defined methodology, that focuses on loan loss experience and trends. Allocations to loan categories are developed based on historical loss and past due trends, managements judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors, including delinquency, default, and loss rates, as well as general economic conditions. Some loans will not be repaid in full. Therefore, an allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents managements best estimate of inherent losses within the loan portfolio. In determining the allowance and the related provision for loan losses, the Corporation considers four principal elements: (i) specific allocations based upon probable losses identified during the review of impaired commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loan portfolios, (ii) allocations established for adversely-rated commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans, (iii) allocations on all other loans based principally on historical loan loss experience, and (iv) an unallocated allowance based on the imprecision in the overall allowance methodology. The first element reflects the Corporations estimate of probable losses based upon the systematic review of impaired commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial adversely-graded loans. These estimates are based upon a number of objective factors, such as payment history, financial condition of the borrower, and discounted collateral exposure. The Corporation measures the investment in an impaired loan based on one of three methods: the loans observable market price, the fair value of the collateral, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. The second element reflects the application of the Corporations loan grading system. This grading system is similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulators. Commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans that are risk rated below a certain predetermined risk grade are assigned a loss allocation factor that is based upon a historical analysis of losses incurred within the specific risk grade category. The lower the grade assigned to a loan or category, the greater the allocation percentage that is generally applied. The third element is determined by assigning allocations based principally upon the three-year average of loss experience for each type of loan. Average losses may be adjusted based on current loan loss and delinquency trends and for the projected impact of loans acquired in branch and bank acquisitions. Loan loss analyses are conducted at least annually. 18 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The fourth element is based on factors that cannot be associated with a specific credit or loan category and reflects an attempt to ensure that the overall allowance for loan losses appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in the estimates of expected loan losses. Management maintains an unallocated allowance to recognize the uncertainty and imprecision underlying the process of estimating projected loan losses. Determination of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio, which are not necessarily captured by the allocation methodology discussed above, involves the exercise of judgment. The unallocated allowance associated with the imprecision in the risk rating system is based on a historical evaluation of the accuracy of the risk ratings associated with loans. This unallocated portion of the allowance is judgmentally determined and generally serves to compensate for the uncertainty in estimating losses, particularly in times of changing economic conditions, and also considers the possibility of improper risk ratings. The unallocated allowance considers the lagging impact of historical charge-off ratios in periods where future loan charge-offs are expected to increase, trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, the changing portfolio mix in terms of collateral, average loan balance, loan growth, the degree of seasoning in the various loan portfolios, and loans recently acquired through acquisitions. The underlying credit quality of the Corporations real estate residential and consumer loan portfolios is dependent primarily on each borrowers ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the value of the collateral, if any, securing the loan. A borrowers ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions, although other factors may also impact a borrowers ability to pay. The provision for loan losses was $5.20 million in 2006, $4.29 million in 2005, and $3.82 million in 2004. The Corporation experienced net loan charge-offs of $5.65 million in 2006, $4.30 million in 2005 and $2.83 million in 2004. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.20% in 2006, 0.16% in 2005 and 0.11% in 2004. The increase in net loan charge-offs in 2006 occurred in the commercial loan types. The three largest commercial loan charge-offs were real estate based loans and totaled $2.1 million. These three loan charge-offs represented 51% of total gross commercial loan type charge-offs in 2006. The Corporations allowance was $34.1 million at December 31, 2006 and represented 1.21% of total loans, compared to $34.1 million and 1.26% of total loans at December 31, 2005. During 2006, the Corporation acquired an allowance of $0.4 million in the 2006 branch transaction. The Corporations provision for loan losses was approximately $0.9 million higher in 2006 than in 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net loan charge-offs in 2006, as compared to 2005. The calculation of the provision for loan losses is based upon the results of the Corporations analysis of its loan portfolio, net loan charge-offs and allowance for loan loss methodology. The Corporations provision for loan losses in 2006 was lower than net loan charge-offs primarily due to a $0.4 million decrease in the specific allocation of the allowance on impaired loans. The Corporations total specific allowance on impaired loans decreased to $0.9 million at December 31, 2006 from $1.3 million at December 31, 2005. Impaired loans were $19.8 million as of December 31, 2006, $9.8 million as of December 31, 2005 and $4.6 million as of December 31, 2004. After analyzing the various components of the customer relationships and evaluating the underlying collateral of impaired loans, it was determined that the total of impaired loans requiring an allocation of the allowance for loan losses was $3.8 million at December 31, 2006, $5.1 million at December 31, 2005 and $0.8 million at December 31, 2004. The allowance for loan losses allocated to impaired loans was as follows: $0.9 million at December 31, 2006, $1.3 million at December 31, 2005, and $0.4 million at December 31, 2004. The process of measuring impaired loans and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses requires judgment and estimation, therefore the eventual outcome may differ from the estimates used on these loans. While the Corporation uses relevant information to recognize losses on loans, additional provisions for related losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, customer circumstances and other credit risk factors. continued on next page 19 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONTINUED) The allocation of the allowance in Table 6 is based upon ranges of estimates and is not intended to imply either limitations on the usage of the allowance or exactness of the specific amounts. The entire allowance is available to absorb future loan losses without regard to the categories in which the loan losses are classified. The allocation of the allowance is based upon a combination of factors, including historical loss factors, credit-risk grading, past-due experiences, and the trends in these, as well as other factors, as discussed above.

Noninterest income increased $0.9 million, or 2.4%, in 2006 and declined $0.1 million, or 0.3%, in 2005 compared to the prior year. Noninterest income as a percentage of net revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) was 23.3% in 2006, 21.7% in 2005 and 21.0% in 2004. The following schedule includes the major components of noninterest income during the past three years. TABLE 7.

The increases of $0.6 million, or 3.1%, in 2006 and $1.1 million, or 5.5%, in 2005 were primarily attributable to increases in fees assessed and a higher level of customer activity in areas where fees and service charges are applicable. Trust and investment services revenue (trust services revenue) was $7.9 million in 2006, $7.9 million in 2005 and $7.4 million in 2004. Trust services revenue in 2006 was virtually unchanged from trust services revenue in the prior year, as discretionary assets under management were approximately the same during 2006 and 2005. While positive investment returns in the equity markets produced additional trust services revenue in 2006, it was offset by the effect of modest changes in the composition of assets under management. Trust services revenue increased $0.5 million, or 6.9%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in 2005 was due primarily to increases in discretionary assets coupled with investment returns in the equity markets. Other fees for customer services were $3.1 million in 2006, $2.4 million in 2005 and $2.1 million in 2004. The 2006 increase of $0.7 million, or 29.8%, was primarily attributable to $0.6 million of float income earned on the sale of bank money orders to customers that was recognized in noninterest income in 2006, compared to being recognized in interest income in 2005, as a result of the transfer of the bank money order proceeds to a third party vendor. The 2005 increase of $0.2 million, or 11.4%, was due to increases in both fees assessed and volume generated. ATM and network user fees were $2.7 million in 2006, $2.7 million in 2005 and $2.5 million in 2004. ATM and network user fees in 2006 were virtually unchanged from the prior year, while they increased $0.2 million, or 7.3%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Management believes that the expansion of ATMs by non-banking institutions was the primary reason for the lack of growth of this revenue in 2006. Investment fees of $2.5 million in 2006 were up $0.6 million, or 32%, compared to investment fees of $1.9 million in 2005. Investment fees in 2005 increased $1.3 million, or 214% compared to investment fees of $0.6 million in 2004. The increase in investment fees in 2006 was a result of a broader mix of products and services being offered to customers through the CFC Investment Center program. The significant increase in 2005 was primarily attributable to a change in the operation of the Corporations CFC Investment Center program on January 1, 2005. Prior to January 1, 2005, the sales of mutual fund and annuity investment products and life insurance products were accomplished through a third party vendor relationship, an independent, registered broker/dealer. The Corporation incurred minimal operating expenses with this program through December 31, 2004, as the individuals responsible for the sales of mutual fund and annuity investment products were employees of the third party vendor. Effective January 1, 2005, the Corporation brought the program in-house and the continued on next page 21 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS NONINTEREST INCOME (CONTINUED) employees of the third party vendor associated with the CFC Investment Center program became employees of the Corporation. The Corporation continued to utilize the same third party vendor to facilitate the operation of the CFC Investment Center program in 2006 and 2005 as in 2004. Accordingly, both investment fees earned and operating expenses incurred increased as of January 1, 2005. Insurance commissions were $0.8 million in 2006, $0.9 million in 2005 and $1.3 million in 2004. The decrease in 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily attributable to lower title insurance commissions, which occurred as a direct result of lower real estate residential loan activity and the sale of the Corporations property and casualty insurance business in 2004. Mortgage banking revenue (MBR) was $1.74 million in 2006, $1.66 million in 2005 and $3.33 million in 2004. During 2006, the Corporation sold $118 million of real estate residential loans in the secondary market, compared to $111 million in 2005 and $153 million in 2004. During 2006, generally all fifteen-year and longer term mortgages were sold in the secondary market. Based on similar market conditions and amount of loans sold, MBR for 2006 compared to 2005 was relatively unchanged. Real estate residential loan activity, both refinancing and new loan originations, declined in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher market interest rates and slower economic conditions. The Corporation generally sells the majority of its long-term fixed interest rate real estate residential loan originations in the secondary market as a part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The reduction in real estate residential loans sold in the secondary market in 2005 was partially attributable to the Corporations success in marketing balloon and adjustable interest rate type loans which are held in the Corporations loan portfolio. Consequently, MBR of $1.66 million in 2005 was $1.67 million or 50% less than MBR earned in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation recognized a $1.1 million gain on the sale of $14 million in long-term fixed interest rate real estate residential mortgage loans that were acquired in the 2006 branch transaction. There was no such sale of loans from acquisitions in 2005 or 2004. The Corporation recognized losses on the sale of investment securities of $1.3 million during 2006, net gains of $0.5 million in 2005 and net gains of $1.4 million in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation sold $68 million of U.S. Treasury and government sponsored agency investment securities scheduled to mature in 2007 and 2008 that had an average yield of 3.12%, and realized a $1.3 million loss. The Corporation had a significant volume of investment securities maturing in 2007 and management deemed it prudent to sell and reinvest a portion of these securities during 2006 as part of its interest rate risk management program. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested in U.S. Treasury and government sponsored agency investment securities with an average life of 3 years and an average yield of 4.81%. In 2005, the Corporation extended the average life of the investment securities portfolio and funded loan growth by selling $109 million of short-term investment securities for a net gain of $0.5 million. In 2004, the Corporation extended the average life of the investment securities portfolio by selling $106 million of short-term investment securities and reinvesting in longer-term securities resulting in a $1.4 million net gain. Noninterest income, excluding investment securities net gains and losses and the gain on the sale of loans in 2006, was $40.4 million in 2006, $38.7 million in 2005 and $38.0 million in 2004. Noninterest income, excluding investment securities net gains and losses and the gain on the sale of loans in 2006, increased $1.7 million, or 4.5%, in 2006 and increased $0.7 million, or 1.9%, in 2005. The increase in 2006, compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to increases in service charges on deposit accounts, other fees for customer services and investment fees. The increase in 2005, compared to 2004, was primarily attributable to higher service charges on deposit accounts, investment fees and trust services revenue that was partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue and insurance commissions. 22 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses were $97.9 million in 2006 and $98.5 million in 2005 and 2004. The following schedule includes the major categories of operating expenses during the past three years. TABLE 8. OPERATING EXPENSES Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and wages $ 44,959 $ 44,304 $ 44,763 Employee benefits 11,053 12,462 12,734 Occupancy 9,534 9,421 9,165 Equipment 9,168 8,867 8,955 Postage and courier 2,599 2,559 3,123 Supplies 1,335 1,145 1,082 Professional fees 3,062 3,736 2,841 Outside processing/service fees 1,815 1,347 1,000 Michigan single business tax 1,391 2,012 1,645 Advertising and marketing 1,645 1,720 1,659 Intangible asset amortization 2,087 2,152 2,273 Telephone 1,868 1,696 1,797 Loan and collection 2,482 1,359 1,064 Other 4,876 5,683 6,368 Total Operating Expenses $ 97,874 $ 98,463 $ 98,469 Full-time equivalent staff (at December 31) 1,478 1,434 1,506 Efficiency ratio 56.1 % 54.2 % 52.6 % Operating expenses were $97.9 million in 2006, a decline of $0.6 million, or 0.6%, compared to 2005. The decline in 2006 was primarily due to decreases in employee benefits, professional fees and Michigan single business tax that were partially offset by increases in salaries and wages, equipment expense, outside processing/service fees and loan and collection costs. Operating expenses in 2005 were virtually unchanged from operating expenses in 2004. Operating expenses in 2005 remained stable as increases in occupancy, professional fees, outside processing/service fees and Michigan single business tax were offset by decreases in salaries and wages, employee benefits, postage and courier and other expenses. Total operating expenses as a percentage of total average assets were 2.60% in 2006, 2.60% in 2005 and 2.55% in 2004. Salaries, wages and employee benefits remain the largest components of operating expenses. These expenses totaled $56.0 million in 2006, $56.8 million in 2005 and $57.5 million in 2004. Salaries and wages increased by only $0.7 million, or 1.5%, in 2006 as salary increases and additional salaries attributable to the 2006 branch transaction were largely offset by staff reductions resulting from the Corporations internal consolidation and the closure of eight under-performing branch banking offices during the year. Employee benefits declined $1.4 million, or 11.3%, in 2006. The decline was primarily due to lower pension expense and group health insurance costs. Pension expense in 2006 declined $1.2 million, or 32.5%, compared to 2005, due primarily to the partial freeze of the defined benefit pension plan and the transition to a defined contribution plan for two-thirds of the employees on June 30, 2006. Group health insurance costs declined $0.5 million, or 11.4%, in 2006 due to lower employee healthcare claims experience. Salaries and wages declined by $0.5 million, or 1.0%, in 2005 while the Corporations number of employees, on a full-time equivalent basis, decreased 72 employees, or 5%, during 2005. A major portion of this decrease occurred late in 2005 as the Corporation began to implement its internal bank charter consolidation. Incentive compensation expense, included in this component of operating expenses, was $1.3 million lower in 2005 than in 2004. Conversely, compensation costs of the Corporations CFC Investment Center program recorded in salaries and wages totaled $0.9 million in 2005, compared to no similar costs in 2004. Prior to January 1, 2005, the CFC Investment Center program was outsourced through a third party vendor that provided the Corporation with investment fees, without any corresponding operating costs. The Corporation incurred $1.2 million in total operating costs in 2005 related to the CFC Investment Center program and the change in this program accounts for the increase in the Corporations employees during 2005. Personnel expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses were 57.2% in 2006, 57.7% in 2005 and 58.4% in 2004. continued on next page 23 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OPERATING EXPENSES (CONTINUED) In anticipation of the adoption of the modified prospective method of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), the board of directors of the Corporation in December 2005 accelerated the vesting of certain unvested out-of-the-money nonqualified stock options previously awarded to employees, including executive officers, under the Corporations stock incentive compensation plan. As a result of this action, stock options that otherwise would have vested in years 2006-2009 became fully vested on December 31, 2005. Options to purchase 167,527 shares of the Corporations common stock, or 90% of outstanding unvested options, were accelerated. The weighted average exercise price of the options subject to acceleration was $39.23 per share. The purpose of the acceleration was to enable the Corporation to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in its consolidated statements of income upon adoption of SFAS 123(R) in January 2006. The Corporation also believes that because the options that were accelerated had exercise prices in excess of the then-current market value of the Corporations common stock, the options had limited economic value and were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention. The acceleration of the vesting of these options reduced non-cash compensation expense in years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in the amounts of $0.61 million, $0.37 million, $0.22 million and $0.09 million, respectively, following the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006. In addition, the board of directors granted options to purchase 177,450 shares in December 2005 that became immediately vested. Based on an estimated value calculation using the Black-Scholes methodology, these options had a grant date fair value of $1.66 million. As the 177,450 options granted in December 2005 were vested as of December 31, 2005, the Corporation will not recognize future non-cash compensation expense in conjunction with these options. The Corporation recognized total non-cash compensation expense in 2006, on unvested options that vested in 2006, in accordance with the compensation provisions of SFAS 123(R), of approximately $0.01 million. Occupancy expense of $9.5 million in 2006 increased $0.1 million, or 1.2%, during 2006 and included $0.1 million of internal consolidation costs, primarily related to the closure of eight under-performing branches. Occupancy expense in 2006 remained flat in relation to 2005, due primarily to the reduction in operating costs associated with the closure of the eight branch offices. Occupancy expense increased $0.3 million, or 2.8%, in 2005, due to inflationary increases in several occupancy expense categories. Equipment expense of $9.2 million in 2006 increased $0.3 million, or 3.4%, in 2006, due to higher third-party software maintenance expense being partially offset by lower depreciation expense. Equipment expense declined $0.1 million, or 1.0%, in 2005, due to lower depreciation and software maintenance expenses. Depreciation expense on equipment was $3.5 million, $3.8 million and $4.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Professional fees of $3.1 million in 2006 were $0.7 million, or 18.0%, lower than in 2005. In 2005, professional fees were $0.9 million, or 31.5%, higher than in 2004. The decrease in professional fees in 2006 was mostly attributable to the impact of the change in independent auditors between 2005 and 2006, with a portion of the reduction attributable to lower fees and a portion related to the timing of the services provided between the two years. Accordingly, professional fees are expected to be modestly higher in 2007, as the timing of the services provided in 2006 and 2007 are expected to be similar. The increase in professional fees in 2005 was primarily attributable to increases in internal and external audit fees related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and consulting fees related to the analysis of the branch delivery system during 2005. Outside processing/service fees were $1.8 million in 2006, $1.3 million in 2005 and $1.0 million in 2004. The $0.5 million, or 35%, increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to conversion to a new and enhanced internet banking software platform which increased operating costs during 2006. The $0.35 million, or 35%, increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was largely attributable to increased data processing costs. Michigan single business tax was $1.4 million in 2006, $2.0 million in 2005 and $1.6 million in 2004. The Michigan single business tax is not an income tax and therefore deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recorded related to this tax, which can result in moderate fluctuations in expense between years. The decline in 2006 was primarily attributable to a reduction in taxable income and the reversal of $0.4 million in expense related to the reversal of contingent tax reserves no longer required due to the expiration of the statutory audit period. There were no similar tax reserve reversals recorded during 2005 and 2004. The increase in loan and collection expense reflects higher costs associated with holding and disposing of other real estate and repossessed assets and collection costs associated with these assets. Other categories of operating expenses include a wide array of expenses, including postage and courier, supplies, advertising and marketing expenses, intangible asset amortization, telephone costs and other expenses. In total, these other categories of 24 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS operating expenses totaled $14.4 million in 2006, $14.9 million in 2005 and $16.3 million in 2004. The decrease in the other categories of operating expenses in 2006, as compared to 2005, of $0.5 million, or 3.6%, was primarily attributable to the settlement of a lawsuit in the fourth quarter of 2006 that was assumed in the acquisition of Bank West Financial Corporation in 2001, at $0.4 million less than the amount recorded as a contingent liability at the time of the acquisition. In 2005, the $1.4 million, or 8.6%, decrease in other operating expense categories, as compared to 2004, was primarily attributable to decreases in postage and other expenses. The postage expense reduction in 2005 of $0.6 million, as compared to 2004, was mainly attributable to the Corporation offering customers check safe-keeping services on certain checking accounts whereby cancelled checks are no longer returned with customers monthly statements. A portion of the decrease in postage expense was also attributable to the Corporations ability to process image-type customer transaction account statements. The Corporations efficiency ratio, which measures total operating expenses divided by the sum of net interest income (fully taxable equivalent) and noninterest income was 56.1% in 2006, 54.2% in 2005 and 52.6% in 2004. The increases in 2006 and 2005 were primarily attributable to lower net interest income. INCOME TAXES The Corporations effective federal income tax rate was 32.4% in 2006, 32.5% in 2005 and 33.1% in 2004. In 2006 and 2005, the Corporations provision for federal income taxes was reduced primarily as a result of the reassessment of uncertain tax positions. The amount of the reduction in the provision for federal income taxes resulting from the reassessment of uncertain tax positions was $0.2 million in 2006 and $0.9 million in 2005. The fluctuations in the Corporations effective federal income tax rate also reflect changes each year in the proportion of interest income exempt from federal taxation, nondeductible interest expense and other nondeductible expenses relative to pretax income and tax credits. Tax-exempt income (FTE), net of related nondeductible interest expense, totaled $5.6 million for 2006, $4.9 million for 2005 and $4.6 million for 2004. Tax-exempt income (FTE) as a percentage of total interest income (FTE) was 2.5% in 2006, 2.4% in 2005 and 2.4% in 2004. Income before income taxes (FTE) was $71.4 million in 2006, $79.9 million in 2005 and $86.2 million in 2004. LIQUIDITY RISK The Corporation manages its liquidity to ensure that it has the ability to meet the cash withdrawal needs of its depositors, provide funds for borrowers and at the same time ensure that the Corporations own cash requirements are met. The Corporation accomplishes these goals through the management of liquidity at two levels  the parent company and the subsidiary bank. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, the parent companys primary source of funds was subsidiary dividends. The parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the cash necessary to pay dividends to shareholders, invest in new subsidiaries, enter new banking markets, pursue investment opportunities and satisfy other operating requirements. Federal and state banking laws place certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company. Such restrictions have not had, and are not expected to have, any material effect on the Corporations ability to meet its cash obligations or impede its ability to manage its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2006, the Corporations sole subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank, could pay dividends totaling $45.9 million to the parent company without obtaining prior regulatory approval. In addition to these funds, the parent company had $9.6 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006. Chemical Bank manages liquidity to ensure adequate funds are available to meet the cash flow needs of depositors and borrowers. Chemical Banks most readily available sources of liquidity are federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with unaffiliated banks, investment securities classified as available for sale and investment securities classified as held to maturity maturing within one year. These sources of liquidity are supplemented by new deposits, loan payments received from customers and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. At December 31, 2006, Chemical Bank had $49.5 million in federal funds sold, $5.7 million of interest-bearing deposits with unaffiliated banks, $520.9 million in investment securities available for sale continued on next page 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LIQUIDITY RISK (CONTINUED) and $26.8 million in other investment securities maturing within one year. These short-term assets totaled $602.9 million and represented 20.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2006. The Corporations investment securities portfolio historically has been short-term in nature. The average life of the investment securities portfolio, which expresses the average number of years that each principal dollar will be outstanding, was 3.4 years as of December 31, 2006, compared to 3.5 years as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, $153.5 million, or 25.0%, of the Corporations investment securities portfolio will mature during 2007, and another $154.7 million or 25.1%, of the investment securities portfolio will mature during 2008. The combination of the 2007 and 2008 scheduled maturities results in 50.1% of the Corporations investment securities portfolio maturing within two years, as of December 31, 2006. Information about the Corporations investment securities portfolio is summarized in Tables 9, 10 and 11. TABLE 9.

Time deposits of $100,000 or more and the percentage of these deposits to total deposits have increased during the past two years. These deposits increased $46.0 million during 2006 to $355.7 million at December 31, 2006 and increased $91.5 million during 2005 to $309.7 million at December 31, 2005, due primarily to increases in time deposit interest rates during 2006 and 2005, as compared to the interest rates on interest-bearing transaction and savings deposit accounts. Brokered time deposits of $100,000 or more were $3.25 million and $8.29 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2006. Time deposits of $100,000 or more represented 12.3%, 11.0% and 7.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. TABLE 12.

Short-term borrowings are comprised of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB advances that have original maturities of one year or less. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are amounts advanced by customers that are secured by investment securities owned by the Corporations subsidiary bank, as they are not covered by FDIC insurance. Reverse repurchase agreements are a means of raising funds in the capital markets by providing specific securities as collateral. During 2005, the Corporation entered into a $10 million reverse repurchase agreement with another financial institution by selling $11 million in U.S. treasury notes under an agreement to repurchase these notes. This reverse repurchase agreement was repaid during 2006. Short-term FHLB advances are borrowings from the FHLB with original maturities of one year or less and are generally used to fund short-term liquidity needs. FHLB advances, both short-term and long-term combined, are secured under a blanket security agreement by real estate residential first lien loans with an aggregate book value equal to at least 145% of the advances. Short-term borrowings are highly interest rate sensitive. Total short-term borrowings were $209.0 million at December 31, 2006, $203.6 million at December 31, 2005 and $101.8 million at December 31, 2004. Long-term debt, comprised of FHLB advances  long-term, was $145.1 million at December 31, 2006 and $196.8 million at December 31, 2005. FHLB advances  long-term that will mature in 2007 total $15 million. FHLB advances long-term are borrowings that are generally used to fund loans and a portion of the investment securities portfolio. A summary of FHLB advances  long-term outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, is included in Note N to the consolidated financial statements. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS During January 2004, the Corporation borrowed $150 million from the FHLB in fixed interest rate advances with maturities ranging from November 2004 through May 2006. The weighted average life of the $150 million borrowing was 1.6 years and the weighted average interest cost was 1.85%. The Corporation invested the proceeds from the $150 million FHLB borrowing transaction equally in five- and seven-year balloon type mortgage-backed securities that had a projected average yield of 3.40%, a projected weighted average life of 3.03 years and a projected duration of 2.75 years, at the date of the transaction. The Corporation partially renewed these borrowings as they matured in 2005 and 2006 to approximately match the remaining mortgage-backed securities held. At December 31, 2006, approximately $80 million of FHLB advances outstanding were attributable to this transaction. FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS The Corporation has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations, that may require future cash payments. Table 13 summarizes the Corporations obligations and estimated future payments at December 31, 2006. These payments do not include interest.

Interest rate risk is the Corporations primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities and changes in relationships between rate indices. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. Consistency of the Corporations net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Corporations business due to differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change differently from the interest costs on liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity is determined by the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities repricing within a specific time period and the magnitude by which interest rates change on the various types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The management of interest rate sensitivity includes monitoring the maturities and repricing opportunities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity management aims at achieving reasonable stability in both net interest income and the net interest margin through periods of changing interest rates. The Corporations goal is to avoid a significant decrease in net interest income and thus an adverse impact on the profitability of the Corporation in periods of changing interest rates. It is necessary to analyze projections of net interest income based upon the repricing characteristics of the Corporations interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the varying magnitude by which interest rates may change on loans, investment securities, interest-bearing deposit accounts and borrowings. The Corporations interest rate sensitivity is managed through policies and risk limits approved by the boards of directors of the Corporation and its subsidiary bank and an Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). The ALCO, which is comprised of executive management from various areas of the Corporation, including finance, lending, investments and deposit gathering, meets regularly to execute asset and liability management strategies. The ALCO establishes guidelines and monitors the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates. The goal of the ALCO process is to maximize net interest income and the net present value of future cash flows within authorized risk limits. The Corporation has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative financial instruments in the management of interest rate risk, other than best efforts forward commitments utilized to offset the interest rate risk of interest rate lock commitments provided to customers on unfunded real estate residential mortgage loans intended to be sold in the secondary market. In the normal course of the mortgage loan selling process, the Corporation enters into a best efforts forward loan delivery commitment with an investor. The Corporations exposure to market risk on these best efforts forward loan delivery commitments is not significant. The primary technique utilized by the Corporation to measure its interest rate risk is simulation analysis. Simulation analysis forecasts the effects on the balance sheet structure and net interest income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in interest rates, changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, changes in interest rate relationships, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities and loan prepayments. These forecasts are compared against net interest income projected in a stable interest rate environment. While many assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms, several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require an evaluation to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis include prepayments on loans, probable calls of investment securities, changes in market conditions, loan volumes and loan pricing, deposit sensitivity and customer preferences. These assumptions are inherently uncertain as they are subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment. As a result, the simulation analysis cannot precisely forecast the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to many factors such as changes in balance sheet components, interest rate changes, changes in market conditions and management strategies. Management performed various simulation analyses throughout 2006. The Corporations interest rate sensitivity is estimated by first forecasting the next twelve months of net interest income under an assumed environment of constant market interest rates. The Corporation then compares various simulation analyses results to the constant interest rate forecast. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Corporation projected the change in net interest income during the next twelve months assuming short-term market interest rates were to uniformly and gradually increase or decrease by up to 200 basis points over the same time period. These projections were based on the Corporations assets and liabilities remaining static over the next twelve months, while factoring in probable calls of U.S. agency securities and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, real estate residential mortgage loans and certain consumer loans. Mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loan prepayment assumptions were developed from industry averages of prepayment speeds, adjusted for the historical prepayment performance of the Corporations own loans. The Corporations forecasted net interest income sensitivity is monitored by the ALCO within 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS established limits as defined in the Corporations funds management policy. The Corporations policy limits the adverse change of a 200 basis point increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the succeeding twelve months to no more than five percent of managements most likely net interest income forecast. At December 31, 2005, the Corporations net interest income simulation process projected that a 100 basis point increase in general market interest rates during 2006 would decrease net interest income approximately 0.5% during the year, assuming no change in the mix or volume of interest-earning assets or liabilities or change in the shape of the interest yield curve. During 2006, while short-term market interest rates gradually increased 100 basis points, the Corporation experienced a 6.8% decrease in net interest income. Net interest income declined more than projected in 2006 due primarily to the following factors: a change in the interest yield curve during the year that produced a slightly inverted position with long-term interest rates slightly below short-term interest rates at December 31, 2006, a lower level of interest-earning assets in 2006 than in 2005, deposit funds migrating from lower cost transaction and savings accounts to higher cost savings and time deposits, a slight decline in lower cost consumer deposits that were replaced with higher cost business and municipal deposits and heightened pricing competition in all loan categories. Summary information about the interest rate risk measures, as described above, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 is presented below: Year-End 2006 Twelve Month Projection Interest Rate Change Projection (in basis points) −200 −100 0 +100 +200 Percent change in net interest income vs. constant rates 2.6 % 1.4 %  (1.4 )% (3.1 )% Year-End 2005 Twelve Month Projection Interest Rate Change Projection (in basis points) −200 −100 0 +100 +200 Percent change in net interest income vs. constant rates 0.5 % 0.5 %  (0.5 )% (1.1 )% At the end of 2006, the Corporations interest rate risk position was liability sensitive, meaning net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise, other factors being unchanged. CAPITAL Capital provides the foundation for future growth and expansion. Total shareholders equity was $507.9 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $6.8 million, or 1.4%, from total shareholders equity at December 31, 2005. The increase in 2006 was derived primarily from earnings retention (net income less cash dividends paid) of $19.4 million. A summary of the other changes in shareholders equity follows. During 2006, the Corporation issued new shares of stock which increased shareholders equity $1.6 million and experienced a reduction in unrealized losses on securities available for sale, net of taxes, of $2.6 million. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation adopted a new accounting principle, SAB 108. The effect of the adoption of SAB 108 was an increase in shareholders equity of $4.6 million as of January 1, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 is explained in Note B to the consolidated financial statements. These increases in shareholders equity were partially offset by the following decreases in shareholders equity. During 2006, shareholders equity decreased $9.3 million due to the repurchase of 318,558 shares of the Corporations common stock at an average price of $29.33 per share. During December 2006, the board of directors of the Corporation declared its first quarter 2007 cash dividend of $0.285 per share that is payable to shareholders in March 2007. This dividend was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006 in the amount of $7.1 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation adopted a second new accounting principle, SFAS 158. The effect of the adoption of SFAS 158 was to record a reduction in shareholders equity of $5.0 million as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 158 is explained in Notes B and L to the consolidated financial statements. The ratio of shareholders equity to total assets was 13.4% at December 31, 2006, compared to 13.4% at December 31, 2005 and 12.9% at December 31, 2004. The Corporations tangible equity to assets ratio was 11.6%, 11.7% and 11.1% at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines in effect for both banks and bank holding companies, minimum capital levels are based upon perceived risk in the Corporations various asset categories. These guidelines assign risk weights to on- continued on next page 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CAPITAL (CONTINUED) and off-balance sheet items in arriving at total risk-adjusted assets. Regulatory capital is divided by the computed total of risk-adjusted assets to arrive at the risk-based capital ratios. The Corporations capital ratios exceeded the minimum levels prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board at December 31, 2006, as shown in the following table. December 31, 2006 Risk-Based Leverage Capital Ratios Ratio Tier 1 Total Chemical Financial Corporations capital ratios 11.9 % 16.2 % 17.5 % Regulatory capital ratios  well capitalized definition 5.0 6.0 10.0 Regulatory capital ratios  minimum requirements 3.0 4.0 8.0 The Corporations Tier 1 and Total regulatory capital ratios are significantly above the regulatory minimum and well capitalized levels due to the Corporation holding $70 million of investment securities and other assets that are assigned a 0% risk rating, $745 million of investment securities and other assets that are assigned a 20% risk rating, and $1 billion of loans secured by first liens on real estate residential properties and other assets that are assigned a 50% risk rating. These three categories of assets represented 48% of the Corporations total assets at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Corporations subsidiary banks capital ratios exceeded the minimum required of a well-capitalized institution, as defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. See Note T to the consolidated financial statements. From time to time, the board of directors approves common stock repurchase programs allowing management to repurchase shares of the Corporations common stock in the open market. On April 22, 2005, the Corporation announced a new repurchase authorization program of up to 500,000 shares of the Corporations common stock under a stock repurchase program. This authorization rescinded all previous authorizations approved by the board of directors. Under the April 2005 program, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, including the projected parent company cash flow requirements and the Corporations share price. During 2006, 318,558 shares were repurchased under the repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 million. All such repurchases, except for one privately negotiated transaction for 21,458 shares, were made in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which provides a safe harbor for purchases in a given day if an issuer of equity securities satisfies the manner, timing, price and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own common shares in the open market. At December 31, 2006, 54,542 shares of common stock were available for repurchase under the April 2005 authorization. During 2006, 39,036 shares of the Corporations common stock were delivered or attested in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligations by holders of employee stock options. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The following table summarizes the Corporations total monthly share repurchase activity for the year ended December 31, 2006: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Total Average Total Number of Shares Maximum Number of Number of Price Purchased as Part of Shares that May Yet Period Beginning on First Day of Shares Paid Per Publicly Announced Be Purchased Under Month Ended Purchased(1) Share Plans or Programs the Plans or Programs January 31, 2006 3,359 $ 32.67  373,100 February 28, 2006    373,100 March 31, 2006    373,100 April 30, 2006 81,262 29.93 76,500 296,600 May 31, 2006 106,500 29.21 106,500 190,100 June 30, 2006 114,454 29.17 114,100 76,000 July 31, 2006 21,458 29.18 21,458 54,542 August 31, 2006 693 29.90  54,542 September 30, 2006 5,948 29.60  54,542 October 31, 2006 11,260 30.20  54,542 November 30, 2006 8,038 30.96  54,542 December 31, 2006 4,622 33.23  54,542 Total 357,594 $ 29.52 318,558 (1) Includes shares delivered or attested in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligations by holders of employee stock options who exercised options in 2006. The Corporations stock compensation plans permit employees to use stock to satisfy such obligations based on the market value of the stock on the date of exercise. OUTLOOK The Corporations philosophy is that it intends to be a family of community banks that operate under the direction of a combined corporate and subsidiary bank board of directors, a holding company and community bank management team and community bank advisory boards of directors. The Corporation is committed to the community banking philosophy and to the communities it serves. Community bank advisory boards of directors have been established in the communities where the legal bank charter was merged into Chemical Bank. The purpose of the internal bank charter consolidations was to provide the Corporation with increased opportunities for revenue growth and operating efficiencies. The Corporation strives to remain a quality sales and service organization and is dedicated to sustained profitability through the preservation of the community banking concept in an ever-changing and increasingly competitive environment. The Corporation believes it has designed its policies regarding asset/liability management, liquidity, lending, investment strategy and expense control to provide for the safety and soundness of the organization, and future earnings growth.

Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Effective May 11, 2006, the board of directors of the Corporation dismissed Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) as the Corporations independent registered public accounting firm. The dismissal of E&Y was recommended and approved by the Audit Committee of the Corporations board of directors on April 17, 2006. On that same date, the Audit Committee recommended and approved the engagement of KPMG LLP (KPMG) as independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2006. The change in accounting firms was based on the results of a competitive bidding process. The audit reports of E&Y on the Corporations consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and E&Ys report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the calendar years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and from December 31, 2005 through the effective date of E&Ys dismissal (the Relevant Period), there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(l)(iv) of Regulation S-K issued under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and its related instructions) between the Corporation and E&Y on any matters of accounting principle or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in connection with its reports. Also during the Relevant Period, there were no reportable events between the Corporation and E&Y (as described in Item 304(a)(l)(v) of Regulation S-K issued under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and its related instructions). During the Relevant Period, the Corporation did not consult with KPMG regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction (either completed or proposed), the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Corporations financial statements, or any other matter that was the subject of a disagreement or reportable event. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting that is designed to produce reliable financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management and tested for reliability through a program of internal audits. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Management assessed the Corporations system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Managements assessment is based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, its system of internal control over financial reporting was effective and meets the criteria of the Internal Control  Integrated Framework. The Corporations independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the Corporations consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on the Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 and managements assessment of the internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 36. David B. Ramaker Lori A. Gwizdala Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President and Treasurer February 28, 2007 February 28, 2007 35 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Chemical Financial Corporation We have audited Managements Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Chemical Financial Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Chemical Financial Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Chemical Financial Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also, in our opinion, Chemical Financial Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial position of Chemical Financial Corporation and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Detroit, Michigan February 28, 2007 36 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Chemical Financial Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Chemical Financial Corporation and subsidiary as of December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of Chemical Financial Corporation as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were audited by other auditors whose report dated February 24, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Chemical Financial Corporation and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Notes B and L to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of measuring prior-year uncorrected misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements and its method of accounting for defined benefit and postretirement obligations in 2006. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Chemical Financial Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

consolidated financial statements. 41 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting and reporting policies of Chemical Financial Corporation (the Corporation) and its subsidiary conform to United States generally accepted accounting principles and prevailing practices within the banking industry. Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant accounting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiary are described below: Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements of the Corporation include the accounts of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Chemical Bank. On December 31, 2005, Chemical Bank Shoreline and Chemical Bank West, wholly owned subsidiaries, were consolidated into Chemical Bank and Trust Company (CBT). As of that date, CBT was renamed Chemical Bank and became the sole subsidiary of the Corporation. All significant income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Corporation consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) in which it is the primary beneficiary. In general, a VIE is an entity that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3) has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. If any of these characteristics are present, the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation model, and consolidation is based on variable interests, not on ownership of the entitys outstanding voting stock. Variable interests are defined as contractual, ownership, or other money interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entitys net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE; the primary beneficiary is defined as the enterprise that absorbs a majority of expected losses or receives a majority of residual returns (if the losses or returns occur), or both. The Corporation is a significant limited partner in one low income housing tax credit partnership that was acquired in 2001 as part of the merger with Shoreline Financial Corporation. This entity meets the FASBs Interpretation No. 46(R) definition of a VIE. The Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE in which it holds an interest, and therefore the equity investment in the VIE is not consolidated in the financial statements. Exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with this entity at December 31, 2006 was limited to approximately $1.5 million recorded as the Corporations investment, which includes unfunded obligations to this project of $1.1 million. The Corporations investment in the project is recorded in interest receivable and other assets and the future financial obligation to this project is recorded in interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position at December 31, 2006. Reclassification: Certain amounts in the 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform with the 2006 presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on shareholders equity or net income. Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from unaffiliated banks and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods. Investment Securities: Investment securities include investments in debt securities and certain equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Investment securities are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). SFAS 115 requires investments to be classified within one of three categories (trading, held to maturity, or available for sale), based on the type of security and managements intent with regard to selling the security. The Corporation held no trading investment securities during the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. Designation as an investment security held to maturity is made at the time of acquisition and is based on the Corporations intent and ability to hold the security to maturity. Investment securities held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity, based on the effective interest yield method. 42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investment securities that are not held to maturity are accounted for as securities available for sale, and are stated at estimated fair value, with the aggregate unrealized gains and losses, not deemed other-than-temporary, classified as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities available for sale and other-than-temporary impairment changes, are determined using the specific identification method and are included within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. Premiums and discounts on investment securities available for sale are amortized over the estimated lives of the related investment securities, based on the effective interest yield method. On November 3, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. FSP 115-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005, and addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. The guidance in FSP 115-1 amends SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, SFAS 124, Accounting for Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. FSP 115-1 also replaced the impairment evaluation guidance (paragraphs 10-18) of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-01, and superseded EITF Topic No. D-44, Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value. The disclosure requirements of EITF 03-01 remain in effect. FSP 115-1 clarified that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not been made. The adoption of FSP 115-1 did not have a significant impact on the Corporation in 2006. Other Securities: Other securities consisted of Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLB) stock of $16.2 million and $19.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock of $5.9 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other securities are recorded at cost or par, which is deemed to be the net realizable value of these assets. The Corporation is required to own FHLB stock and FRB stock in accordance with its membership in these organizations. The FHLB requires its members to provide a five year advance notice of any request to redeem FHLB stock. Loans: Loans are stated at their principal amount outstanding. Loan origination costs and commitment points are deferred. The amount deferred is reported as part of loans and is recognized as interest income over the term of the loan as a yield adjustment. Loan performance is reviewed regularly by loan review personnel, loan officers and senior management. Loan interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The past-due status of a loan is based on the loans contractual terms. A loan is placed in the nonaccrual category when principal or interest is past due ninety days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when, in the opinion of management, there is sufficient reason to doubt the collectibility of future principal or interest. Interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed and charged against interest income at the time the loan is placed in nonaccrual status. The subsequent recognition of interest income on a nonaccrual loan is then recognized only to the extent cash is received and where future collection of principal is probable. Loans are returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are brought current and collectibility is no longer in doubt. Interest income on restructured loans is recognized according to the terms of the restructure, subject to the above described nonaccrual policy. Nonperforming loans are comprised of those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis, accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and other loans for which the terms have been restructured to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower. All nonaccrual commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans have been determined by the Corporation to meet the definition of an impaired loan. In addition, other commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans may be considered an impaired loan. A loan is defined to be impaired when it is probable that continued on next page 43 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) payment of principal and interest will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. A portion of the allowance for loan losses may be allocated to impaired loans. All impaired loans are evaluated individually to determine whether or not a specific impairment allowance is required. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market. The value of mortgage loans held for sale and other residential mortgage loan commitments to customers are hedged by utilizing best efforts forward commitments to sell loans to investors in the secondary market. Such forward commitments are generally entered into at the time when applications are taken to protect the value of the mortgage loans from increases in interest rates during the period held. Mortgage loans originated are generally sold within a period of thirty to forty-five days after closing, and therefore, the related fees and costs are not amortized during that period. Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses (allowance) represents managements assessment of probable losses inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio. The Corporation maintains formal policies and procedures to monitor and control credit risk. Managements evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on a continuing review of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, underlying value of the collateral, risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, the level and composition of nonperforming loans, the financial condition of the borrowers, balance of the loan portfolio, loan growth, economic conditions, employment levels of the Corporations local markets, and special factors affecting specific business sectors. The allowance provides for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio, but that have not been specifically identified. Internal risk ratings are assigned to each commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loan at the time of approval and are subject to subsequent periodic reviews by senior management. The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly on all large loans that have deteriorated below certain levels of credit risk, and may allocate a specific portion of the allowance to such loans based upon this review. A portion of the allowance is allocated to the remaining loans by applying projected loss ratios, based on numerous factors. Projected loss ratios incorporate factors such as recent charge-off experience, trends with respect to adversely risk rated commercial, real estate commercial and real estate construction-commercial loans, trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual loans and current economic conditions and trends, and are supported by underlying analysis. This evaluation involves a high degree of uncertainty. Management maintains an unallocated allowance to recognize the uncertainty and imprecision underlying the process of estimating projected loan losses. Determination of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio, which are not necessarily captured by the allocation methodology discussed above, involves the exercise of judgment. The unallocated allowance associated with the imprecision in the risk rating system is based on a historical evaluation of the accuracy of the risk ratings associated with loans. While the Corporation uses relevant information to recognize losses on loans, additional provisions for related losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, customer circumstances, changes in value of underlying collateral and other credit risk factors. Although the Corporation periodically allocates portions of the allowance to specific loans and loan portfolios, the entire allowance is available for any loan losses that occur. Collection efforts may continue and recoveries may occur after a loan is charged against the allowance. Loans which are deemed uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance. The provision for loan losses and recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is presented as a reserve against loans. The Corporation utilizes the loss experience of other banking institutions and regulatory guidance in addition to its own loss experience. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment on information available to them at the time of their examination. 44 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Mortgage Banking Operations: The origination of real estate residential (mortgage) loans is an integral component of the business of the Corporation. The Corporation generally sells its originations of long-term fixed interest rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. Gains and losses on the sales of these loans are determined using the specific identification method. Long-term fixed interest rate residential mortgage loans originated for sale are generally held for forty-five days or less. The Corporation sells mortgage loans in the secondary market on either a servicing retained or released basis. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate basis. The Corporation accounts for mortgage servicing rights in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS 140). SFAS 140 requires that an asset be recognized for the rights to service mortgage loans, including those rights that are created by the origination of mortgage loans that are sold with the servicing rights retained by the originator. The recognition of the asset results in an increase in the gains recognized upon the sale of the mortgage loans sold. The Corporation amortizes mortgage servicing rights in proportion to, and over the life of, the estimated net future servicing income and performs a periodic evaluation of the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights. Prepayments of mortgage loans result in increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights as the remaining book value of the mortgage servicing right is expensed at the time of prepayment. Any impairment of mortgage servicing rights is recognized as a valuation allowance, resulting in a reduction of mortgage banking revenue. The valuation allowance is recovered when impairment no longer exists. For purposes of measuring fair value, the Corporation utilizes a third-party modeling software program, which stratifies capitalized mortgage servicing rights by interest rate, term and loan type. Servicing income is recognized in noninterest income when received and expenses are recognized when incurred. Premises and Equipment: Land is recorded at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Premises and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are generally 25 to 39 years for buildings and three to ten years for all other depreciable assets. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Other Real Estate: Other real estate (ORE) is comprised of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. ORE is recorded at the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of transfer, with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount, not to exceed the initial carrying value of the assets at the time of transfer. Changes in the fair value of ORE subsequent to transfer are recorded in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of ORE are also recognized in other operating expenses on the date of sale. Other real estate totaling $8.5 million and $6.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is included in the consolidated statements of financial position in interest receivable and other assets. Intangible Assets: Intangible assets consist of goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles, and mortgage servicing rights. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with SFAS 142. Core deposit intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from three to 15 years on a straight-line or accelerated basis, as applicable. Other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the life of, the estimated net future servicing income. Stock Options: Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under that method, compensation cost is recognized for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123). continued on next page 45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) The resulting fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for share-based awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and over the requisite service period for share-based awards granted after the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The requisite service period is the shorter of the vesting period or the period of retirement eligibility. The Corporation did not recognize compensation expense in accounting for awards of options under its stock option plans prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). If the Corporation had elected to recognize compensation expense for options vested in 2005 and 2004, based on the fair value of the options granted at the grant dates, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands, except per share data): 2005 2004 Net income  as reported $ 52,878 $ 56,682 Proforma stock-based employee compensation cost, net of tax (2,592 ) (552 ) Net income  pro forma $ 50,286 $ 56,130 Basic earnings per share  as reported $ 2.10 $ 2.26 Basic earnings per share  pro forma 2.00 2.24 Diluted earnings per share  as reported 2.10 2.25 Diluted earnings per share  pro forma 2.00 2.23 Refer to Note R to the consolidated financial statements. Short-term Borrowings: Short-term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB advances. These borrowings have original scheduled maturities of one year or less. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent amounts advanced by customers that are secured by investment securities owned by the Corporations subsidiary bank, as they are not covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. Reverse repurchase agreements are a means of raising funds in the capital markets by providing specific securities as collateral. See the description of FHLB advances below. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances, Short-term and Long-term: FHLB advances are borrowings from the FHLB to fund short-term liquidity needs as well as a portion of the loan and investment securities portfolios. These advances are secured under a blanket security agreement by first lien real estate residential loans with an aggregate book value equal to at least 145% of the FHLB advances. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions: The Corporations defined benefit pension, supplemental pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts and measurements within the framework of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (SFAS 106), respectively. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. Other assumptions involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increase. The Corporation evaluates the critical and other assumptions annually. The discount rate enables the Corporation to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Corporation utilized the results from a bond matching technique to match cash flows of the defined benefit pension plan against both a bond portfolio derived from the S&P bond database of AA or better bonds and the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to determine the discount rate. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension, supplemental pension and postretirement benefit expenses. The Corporation increased the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations to 6.00% as of December 31, 2006 from 5.60% as of December 31, 2005 to reflect market interest rate conditions. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets, the Corporation considers the current and expected asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plan, as well as historical and expected returns on each asset class. A lower expected rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets will increase pension expense. The long-term expected rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets was 7% in 2006, and 8% in both 2005 and 2004. See Note L to the consolidated financial statements. 46 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). The Corporation adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, as required. The purpose of SFAS 158 is to improve the overall financial statement presentation of pension and other postretirement plans, but does not impact the determination of the net periodic benefit cost or measurement of plan assets or obligations. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the over- or under-funded status of a plan as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The impact of the adoption of SFAS 158 on the statement of financial position at December 31, 2006 is summarized in Note L to the consolidated financial statements. Income and Other Taxes: The Corporation is subject to the income and other tax laws of the United States and the state of Michigan. These laws are complex and are subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. In determining the provision for income and other taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws, related regulations and case law. In the process of preparing the Corporations tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on managements ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law. The Corporation and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for federal income taxes is based on income and expenses, as reported in the consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on the Corporations federal income tax return. When income and expenses are recognized in different periods for tax purposes than for book purposes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective federal and state tax rates based upon its current best estimate of taxable income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on an annual basis, or sooner, if business events or circumstances warrant. Reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations of audits. Management also assesses the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis using information about the Corporations current and historical financial position and results of operations. Management expects to realize the full benefits of the deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2006. Earnings Per Share: Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share (SFAS 128). All earnings per share amounts for all periods presented conform to the requirements of SFAS 128, including the effects of stock dividends. Basic earnings per share for the Corporation is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share for the Corporation is computed by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. continued on next page 47 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) The Corporations common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of stock options granted under the Corporations stock option plans, using the treasury stock method.

The Corporation displays comprehensive income as a component in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity. Operating Segment: The Corporation operates in a single operating segment  commercial banking. The Corporation is a financial holding company that operated one commercial bank, Chemical Bank, at December 31, 2006. On December 31, 2005, a corporate internal consolidation was completed resulting in the consolidation of the Corporations three commercial bank charters into one subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank. Chemical Bank continues to operate through an organizational structure of community banks, offering a full range of commercial banking and fiduciary products and services to the residents and business customers in their geographical market areas. The products and services offered by Chemical Bank, through branch bank offices, are generally consistent throughout the Corporation, as generally is the pricing of these products and services. Chemical Bank branch bank offices operate exclusively within the state of Michigan. The marketing of products and services by Chemical Banks branch offices is generally uniform. The distribution of products and services is uniform throughout the Corporation and is achieved primarily through retail branch bank offices, automated teller machines and electronically accessed banking products. The Corporations primary sources of revenue are from its loan products and investment securities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets: The FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS 156), which amends SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS 156 permits an entity to choose either of the following subsequent measurement methods for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities:  Amortization Method  Amortize servicing assets or servicing liabilities in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income or net servicing loss and assess the servicing assets or liabilities for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date.  Fair Value Measurement Method  Measure servicing assets or servicing liabilities at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair value in earnings in the periods in which the changes occur. The Corporation adopted the amortization method on January 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 156 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 48 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair Value Measurements: In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) on fair value measurement. SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. Over forty current accounting standards within generally accepted accounting principles require (or permit) entities to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. Prior to SFAS 157, the methods for measuring fair value were diverse and inconsistent, especially for items that are not actively traded. In the case of derivatives, the FASB consulted with investors, who generally supported fair value, even when market data are not available, along with expanded disclosure of the methods used and the effect on earnings. Under SFAS 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts such sales or transfers. SFAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. In support of this principle, SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data, for example, the reporting entitys own data. Under SFAS 157, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation has not determined the impact that SFAS 157 will have on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: The FASB released the final interpretation of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) is only addressed if step one has been satisfied (i.e., the position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained). Under step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48s use of the term more-likely-than-not in steps one and two is consistent with how that term is used in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than 50 percent). Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period in which they meet the more-likely-than-not standard, or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. FIN 48 includes expanded disclosure requirements, including a tabular roll forward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months. These disclosures are required at each annual reporting period unless a significant change occurs in an interim period. The Corporation adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE B  ADOPTION OF CERTAIN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet perspective (iron curtain approach) and income statement perspective (rollover approach) and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The Corporation historically used the rollover approach, which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement, including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements. This approach quantified misstatements based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement. The iron curtain approach considers the misstatements existing at each balance sheet date, irrespective of the period of origin of the misstatement. The Corporation does not believe any of the amounts described below are material to the periods in which they originated using the rollover approach. The Corporation completed its analysis under both the rollover and iron curtain approaches and adopted SAB 108 as of January 1, 2006. Upon the adoption of SAB 108, the Corporation determined that, using the iron curtain approach, the quantitative cumulative misstatements aggregating approximately $4.6 million on a net basis that existed as of December 31, 2005, are material to the 2006 financial statements. As permitted when first applying the guidance in SAB 108, prior year financial statements were not restated. In accordance with the adoption of SAB 108, the Corporation recorded a $4.6 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $2.5 million, to retained earnings as of January 1, 2006 for the items described below. The Corporation reversed operating expense accruals related to employee benefit expenses and other operating expenses of $4.3 million as of January 1, 2006. These over-accrued operating expenses occurred as a result of actual expense amounts being less than originally estimated and recorded during a time period ended prior to December 31, 2003. The Corporation historically recorded certain fee-based revenue, primarily trust services revenue and commissions earned on the sale of alternative investment products, such as annuities and mutual funds, on a cash basis versus an accrual basis. This method resulted in one month of this revenue not being recorded. The Corporation recorded a receivable for one-month of this revenue of $0.7 million as of January 1, 2006. The Corporation capitalized $0.9 million of expense related to prepaid property taxes that were paid, although expensed in prior years, as was the Corporations historical practice through December 31, 2005. The Corporation historically, through December 31, 2005, recorded direct fees paid to third-party dealers to purchase consumer loans, primarily automobile loans, on a cash basis versus capitalizing these costs and amortizing them over the life of the applicable loan by the interest yield method, as required by SFAS No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases (SFAS 91). This methodology resulted in the reduction of the yield on the applicable loan in the period of origination versus over the life of the loan as prescribed in SFAS 91. In accordance with SAB 108, the Corporation capitalized $1.2 million of costs as of January 1, 2006 that were previously recorded as reductions in net interest income in years 2003 through 2005. The amortization of a portion of the $1.2 million of capitalized costs in 2006, as prescribed by SFAS 91, reduced net interest income $0.7 million in 2006. The net impact of the adoption of SAB 108 at January 1, 2006 was an increase in the Corporations shareholders equity of $0.18 per share. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. The Corporation adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, as required. The purpose of SFAS 158 is to improve the overall financial statement presentation of pension and other postretirement plans, but does not impact the determination of the net periodic benefit cost or measurement of plan assets or obligations. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the over- or under-funded status of the plan as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adoption of SFAS 158 on the consolidated statement of financial position at December 31, 2006 reduced total assets by $5.9 million, decreased total liabilities by $0.9 million and increased accumulated other comprehensive loss by $5.0 million. Additional information is contained in Note L to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE C  MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS The Corporations primary method of expansion into new banking markets has been through acquisitions of other financial institutions and bank branches. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, the Corporation completed he following acquisition: In August 2006, the Corporation acquired two branch bank offices in Hastings and Wayland, Michigan from First Financial Bank, N.A., headquartered in Hamilton, Ohio, operating as Sand Ridge Bank (2006 branch transaction). The Corporation acquired deposits of $47 million, loans of $64 million and other miscellaneous assets of $1.7 million. The Corporation recorded goodwill of $6.8 million, including purchase accounting adjustments of $2.5 million, and core deposit intangible assets of $2.7 million. The core deposit intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over ten years, with $0.2 million of amortization expense recognized in 2006. The loans acquired were comprised of $6 million in commercial loans, $13 million in real estate commercial loans, $38 million in real estate residential loans and $7 million of consumer loans. During December 2006, the Corporation sold $14 million of loans acquired in this transaction and recognized gains totaling approximately $1 million. The loans sold were long-term fixed interest rate real estate residential loans. On December 31, 2005, the Corporation completed an organizational internal consolidation whereby two of its wholly-owned subsidiary banks, Chemical Bank Shoreline and Chemical Bank West, were consolidated into Chemical Bank.

The Corporation recognized losses on investment securities of $1.33 million during 2006, net gains of $0.54 million in 2005 and net gains of $1.37 million in 2004. Gross gains on securities transactions were $1.18 million during 2005 and $1.39 million during 2004. Gross losses on securities transactions during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $1.33 million, $0.64 million and $0.02 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation sold $68 million of U.S. Treasury and government sponsored agency investment securities scheduled to mature in 2007 and 2008 that had an average yield of 3.12% and realized a $1.33 million loss. The Corporation has a significant volume of investment 52 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS securities maturing in 2007 and 2008 and management deemed it prudent to sell and reinvest a portion of these securities during 2006. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested in similar type securities with an average life of 3 years and an average yield of 4.81%. An analysis is performed quarterly by the Corporation to determine whether unrealized losses in its investment securities portfolio are temporary or other-than-temporary. The Corporation reviews factors such as financial statements, credit ratings, news releases and other pertinent information of the underlying issuer or company to make its determination. Management does not believe any individual unrealized loss as of December 31, 2006 represents an other-than-temporary impairment. Management believes that the unrealized losses on investment securities are temporary in nature and due primarily to changes in interest rates and not as a result of credit-related issues. The Corporation has both the intent and ability to hold the investment securities with unrealized losses to maturity or until such time as the unrealized losses recover. The Corporation did not have a trading portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2006.

The prepayment speed and the discount rate are the most significant factors affecting the MSR valuation. Increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced. Expected loan prepayment rates are validated by a third-party model. At December 31, 2006, the weighted average constant prepayment rate used was 20% and the discount rate was 8%. During 2006 and 2005, the Corporation did not record an impairment provision as there was no decline in the estimated fair value of MSRs compared to the recorded book value. During 2004, the Corporation recovered the impairment valuation allowance of $0.79 million, as the estimated fair value of the MSRs at December 31, 2004 exceeded the book value (original cost less accumulated amortization) of MSRs.

Effective June 30, 2006, benefits under the Pension Plan were frozen for approximately two-thirds of the Corporations salaried employees. Pension benefits continued unchanged for the remaining salaried employees. Normal retirement benefits under the Pension Plan are based on years of vested service and the employees average annual pay for the five highest consecutive years during the ten years preceding retirement, except for employees whose benefits were frozen. Benefits, for employees with less than fifteen years of service or whose age plus years of service were less than sixty-five at June 30, 2006, will be based on years of vested service at June 30, 2006 and generally the average of the employees salary for the five years ended June 30, 2006. Pension Plan contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service-to-date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future, for employees whose benefits were not frozen at June 30, 2006. As a result of the Pension Plan being partially frozen, the Corporation recognized a curtailment gain of $0.11 million in 2006. Employees hired after June 30, 2006 and employees affected by the partial freeze of the Pension Plan began receiving four percent of their eligible pay as a contribution to their 401(k) Savings Plan account on July 1, 2006. The assets of the Pension Plan are invested by the trust and investment management services department of the Corporations bank subsidiary, Chemical Bank. The investment policy and allocation of the assets of the pension trust were approved by the Compensation and Pension Committee of the board of directors of the Corporation. The assets of the Pension Plan are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. Government Treasury notes, U.S. Government agency notes, high quality corporate bonds and equity securities (primarily blue chip stocks) and equity-based mutual funds. International stocks are also allowable investments of the Pension Plan. The notes and the bonds purchased are rated A or better by the major bond rating companies and mature within five years from the date of purchase. The stocks are diversified among the major economic sectors of the market and are selected based on balance sheet strength, expected earnings growth, the management team, and position within their industries, among other characteristics. The Pension Plans asset allocation by asset category at December 31 was as follows: Asset Category 2006 2005 Equity securities 61 % 60 % Debt securities 33 31 Other 6 9 Total 100 % 100 % As of December 31, 2006, based upon current market conditions, the Corporations strategy was to maintain equity securities between 60% and 70% of Pension Plan assets and the Other category was expected to be maintained at less than 10% of Pension Plan assets. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, equity securities included 211,395 shares of the Corporations common stock. During 2006, $0.23 million in cash dividends were paid on the Corporations common stock held by the Pension Plan. The fair value of the Corporations common stock held in the Pension Plan was $7.0 million at December 31, 2006 and $6.7 million at December 31, 2005, and represented 8.8% of Pension Plan assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005. continued on next page 59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE L  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (CONTINUED) The following table sets forth the changes in the projected benefit obligation and plan assets of the Corporations Pension Plan: 2006 2005 (In thousands) Projected benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 84,772 $ 75,367 Service cost 3,177 4,879 Interest cost 4,452 4,273 Net actuarial (gain) loss (9,993 ) 2,797 Benefits paid (2,864 ) (2,544 ) Curtailment obligation (3,964 )  Benefit obligation at end of year 75,580 84,772 Fair value of plan assets: Beginning fair value 76,155 71,937 Actual return on plan assets 6,582 698 Employer contributions  6,064 Benefits paid (2,864 ) (2,544 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 79,873 76,155 Funded (unfunded) status of the plan 4,293 (8,617 ) Unrecognized net actuarial loss 8,581 23,550 Unrecognized prior service benefit (26 ) (147 ) Prepaid benefit cost before adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 12,848 14,786 Additional liability under SFAS 158 (8,555 )  Prepaid benefit cost  Pension Plan $ 4,293 $ 14,786 The Corporations accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 for the Pension Plan was $66.6 million and $66.2 million, respectively. During 2006, the Corporation did not make any contributions to the Pension Plan. The 2007 minimum required Pension Plan contribution, as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, was estimated at zero. The Corporation does not anticipate making a contribution to the Pension Plan in 2007 as the Pension Plan was overfunded at December 31, 2006. Weighted-average rate assumptions of the Pension Plan follow: 2006 2005 2004 Discount rate used in determining benefit obligations  December 31 6.00 % 5.60 % 5.75 % Discount rate used in determining pension expense(1) 6.00 5.75 6.00 Expected long-term return on Pension Plan assets 7.00 8.00 8.00 Rate of compensation increase 4.25 5.00 5.00 (1) The Pension Plan discount rate was 5.60% from January 1 through May 31, 2006. The discount rate was changed to 6.25% effective June 1, 2006 in conjunction with the partial freeze of the Pension Plan, resulting in an average discount rate of 6.00% in 2006.

The Internal Revenue Code limits both the amount of eligible compensation for benefit calculation purposes and the amount of annual benefits that may be paid from a tax-qualified retirement plan. As permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Corporation established the Supplemental Plan that provides payments to certain executive officers of the Corporation, as determined by the Compensation and Pension Committee, the benefits to which they would have been entitled, calculated under the provisions of the Pension Plan, as if the limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code did not apply. The following table sets forth the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets of the Supplemental Plan: 2006 2005 (In thousands) Projected benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 789 $ 674 Service cost 21 15 Interest cost 43 38 Net actuarial (gain) loss (180 ) 103 Benefits paid (41 ) (41 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 632 789 Fair value of plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year   Employer contributions 41 41 Benefits paid (41 ) (41 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year   Unfunded status of the plan 632 789 Unrecognized net actuarial gain (loss) 79 (102 ) Accrued benefit cost before adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 711 687 Reduction of liability under SFAS 158 (79 )  Liability for Supplemental Plan benefits $ 632 $ 687 The Supplemental Plans accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $0.53 million and $0.71 million, respectively.

Through December 31, 2001, eligibility for such benefits was age 55 with at least ten years of service with the Corporation. Effective January 1, 2002, the Corporation adopted a revised retiree medical program (Postretirement Plan), which substantially reduced the future obligation of the Corporation for retiree medical and dental costs. Retirees and certain employees that met age and service requirements as of December 31, 2001 were grandfathered under the Postretirement Plan. As of December 31, 2006, the Postretirement Plan included 29 active employees that were in the grandfathered group and 115 retirees. The majority of the retirees are required to make contributions toward the cost of their benefits based on their years of credited service and age at retirement. All 29 active employees are currently eligible to receive benefits and will be required to make contributions toward the cost of their benefits upon retirement. Retiree contributions are generally adjusted annually. The accounting for these postretirement benefits anticipates changes in future cost-sharing features such as retiree contributions, deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate these benefits at any time. Employees who retire at age 55 or older and have at least ten years of service with the Corporation are provided access to the Corporations group health insurance coverage for the employee and a spouse, with no employer subsidy, and are not considered participants in the Postretirement Plan. 62 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table sets forth changes in the Corporations Postretirement Plan benefit obligation: 2006 2005 (In thousands) Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 5,427 $ 5,328 Interest cost 271 281 Net actuarial (gain) loss (613 ) 112 Benefits paid, net of retiree contributions (306 ) (294 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 4,779 5,427 Fair value of plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year   Employer contributions, net of retiree contributions 306 294 Benefits paid, net of retiree contributions (306 ) (294 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year   Unfunded status of the plan 4,779 5,427 Unrecognized net actuarial loss (1,095 ) (1,710 ) Unrecognized prior service credit 1,921 2,246 Accrued postretirement benefit cost before adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 5,605 5,963 Reduction of liability under SFAS 158 (826 )  Liability for Postretirement Plan benefits $ 4,779 $ 5,963 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost of the Postretirement Plan consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Service cost $  $  $ 30 Interest cost 271 281 316 Amortization of prior service credit (325 ) (324 ) (324 ) Amortization of unrecognized net loss 56 61 324 Pension expense $ 2 $ 18 $ 346 The estimated gains/costs that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic cost over the next fiscal year for the Postretirement Plan include $0.3 million of prior service credit as a gain and an immaterial net loss as a cost.

SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans: In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. The Corporation adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, as required. The purpose of SFAS 158 is to improve the overall financial statement presentation of pension and other postretirement plans, but does not impact the determination of the net periodic benefit cost or measurement of plan assets or obligations. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the over- or under-funded status of each plan as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The impact of the adoption of SFAS 158 on the consolidated statement of financial position and accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2006 is summarized in the following table: Incremental Effect of Applying SFAS 158 on Individual Line Items in the Statement of Financial Position December 31, 2006 Before Application of After Application of SFAS 158 Adjustment SFAS 158 (In thousands) Interest receivable and other assets $ 59,197 $ (5,878 ) $ 53,319 Total assets 3,795,125 (5,878 ) 3,789,247 Interest payable and other liabilities 30,140 (905 ) 29,235 Total liabilities 3,282,266 (905 ) 3,281,361 Accumulated other comprehensive loss 3,977 4,973 8,950 Total shareholders equity 512,859 (4,973 ) 507,886 Prepaid benefit cost  Pension Plan(1) $ 12,848 $ (8,555 ) $ 4,293 Deferred income tax asset(1) 10,992 2,677 13,669 Liability for Supplemental Plan benefits(2) 711 (79 ) 632 Liability for Postretirement Plan benefits(2) 5,605 (826 ) 4,779 (1) Included in interest receivable and other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The 401(k) Savings Plan is available to all regular employees and provides employees with tax deferred salary deductions and alternative investment options. The Corporation matches 50% of the participants elective deferrals on the first 4% of the participants base compensation. The 401(k) Savings Plan provides employees with the option to invest in the Corporations common stock.

FHLB advances totaled $175.1 million at December 31, 2006, comprised of $30 million in short-term advances and $145.1 million in long-term continued on next page 65 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE N  FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES  LONG-TERM (CONTINUED) advances. The Corporations additional borrowing availability, subject to the FHLBs credit requirements and policies, through the FHLB at December 31, 2006, based on the amount of FHLB stock owned, was $148 million. For the convertible fixed-rate advances, the FHLB has the option to convert the advance to a variable rate each quarter. The Corporation has the option to prepay, without penalty, the FHLB convertible fixed-rate advance only when the FHLB exercises its option to convert it to a variable-rate advance. During 2006, the FHLB exercised this option on two advances totaling $20 million. The Corporation chose to prepay both of these advances in 2006. Prepayments of fixed-rate advances are subject to prepayment penalties under the provisions and conditions of the credit policy of the FHLB. The Corporation did not incur any prepayment penalties in 2006, 2005 or 2004. The scheduled principal reductions on FHLB advances  long-term outstanding at December 31, 2006 were as follows (in thousands): 2007 $ 15,023 2008 80,024 2009 10,025 2010 40,000 Total $ 145,072 NOTE O  SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY On April 22, 2005, the Corporation announced that the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of the Corporations common stock. The repurchased shares are available for later reissue in connection with potential future stock dividends, the Corporations dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes. This authorization replaced all prior share repurchase authorizations. Shares repurchased under this authorization totaled 318,558 in 2006. At December 31, 2006, 54,542 shares of common stock were available for repurchase under the April 2005 authorization. NOTE P  GOODWILL Goodwill was $70.1 million and $63.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Goodwill increased $6.8 million due to the 2006 branch transaction. The Corporations goodwill impairment review is performed annually by management and is additionally reviewed by an independent third party appraisal firm. The income and fair value approach methodologies were utilized by the appraisal firm to estimate the value of the Corporations goodwill. The income approach quantifies the present value of future economic benefits by capitalizing or discounting the cash flows of a business. This approach considers projected dividends, earnings, dividend paying capacity and future residual value. The fair value approach estimates the value of the entity by comparing it to similar companies that have recently been acquired or companies that are publicly traded on an organized exchange. The estimate of fair value includes a comparison of the financial condition of the entity against the financial characteristics and pricing information of comparable companies. Based on the results of these valuations, the Corporations goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2006 or 2005. 66 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE Q  ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The following tables set forth the carrying amounts, accumulated amortization and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets (in thousands): December 31, 2006 Original Accumulated Carrying Amount Amortization Amount Core deposit intangibles $ 21,956 $ 15,577 $ 6,379 December 31, 2005 Original Accumulated Carrying Amount Amortization Amount Core deposit intangibles $ 19,269 $ 13,666 $ 5,603 Other 690 514 176 During 2006, core deposit intangibles increased $2.7 million due to the 2006 branch transaction.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Corporation accounted for these options under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (Opinion 25), and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS 123. No stock-based employee compensation cost was recognized in the consolidated statements of income for years ended prior to December 31, 2006, as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified-prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized during 2006 includes compensation cost for all share-based payments (stock options) granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123. Results for the prior periods have not been restated. The resulting fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), and over the requisite service period for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The requisite service period is the shorter of the vesting period or the period to retirement eligibility. Forfeitures have been insignificant historically and are expected to continue to be insignificant. continued on next page 67 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE R  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED) As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, the Corporation recognized compensation expense related to stock options for the year ended December 31, 2006 of twelve thousand dollars. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 did not change as a result of the Corporation adopting SFAS 123(R). The Corporation reported basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.88 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) was decreased as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of options to purchase 167,527 shares of the Corporations common stock in December 2005. The acceleration of the vesting of these options reduced non-cash compensation expense in 2006 by approximately $0.61 million. In addition, the board of directors granted options to purchase 177,450 shares of common stock in December 2005 that became immediately vested. These options had a grant date fair value of $1.66 million. As the 177,450 options granted in December 2005 were vested as of December 31, 2005, the Corporation will not recognize future non-cash compensation expense in conjunction with these options. SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows realized from the tax benefits of exercised stock option awards that result from actual tax deductions in excess of the recorded tax benefits related to the compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. Accordingly, $0.22 million of tax benefit was classified as a financing cash flow on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006, that would have been classified as an operating cash flow prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The weighted average fair values of options granted during 2005 and 2004 were $9.34 and $11.53 per share, respectively. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2005 2004 Expected dividend yield 3.20 % 2.50 % Expected stock volatility 33.00 32.60 Risk-free interest rate 4.45 3.14 Expected life of options  in years 7.00 7.00 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model using various assumptions. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Corporations stock over a nine-year period. The Corporation uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based primarily upon historical experience. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the contractual life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Because of the unpredictability of the assumptions required, the Black-Scholes model, or any other valuation model, is incapable of accurately predicting the Corporations stock price or of placing an accurate present value on options to purchase its stock. In addition, the Black-Scholes model was designed to approximate value for types of options that are very different from those issued by the Corporation. In spite of any theoretical value that may be placed on a stock option grant, no value is possible under options issued by the Corporation without an increase in the market value of the Corporations stock. Stock Option Plans: The Corporations Stock Incentive Plan of 1997 (1997 Plan), which was shareholder-approved, permitted the grant of options to purchase shares of common stock to its employees. As of December 31, 2006, there were no shares available for future grant under the 1997 Plan, by action of the board of directors in December 2006. Effective January 17, 2006, as approved by the Corporations shareholders at the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders held April 17, 2006, the Corporation established the Stock Incentive Plan of 2006 (2006 Plan). The 2006 Plan permits the grant and award of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock awards, other stock-based and stock-related awards and stock appreciation rights (incentive awards). Subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments, 1,000,000 shares of the Corporations common stock are available for incentive awards under the 2006 Plan. At December 31, 2006, there were 1,000,000 shares available for future issuance under the 2006 Plan. Key employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, as the Compensation and Pension Committee of the board of directors may select from time to time, are eligible to receive awards under the 2006 Plan. No employee of the Corporation may receive 68 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS any awards under the 2006 Plan while the employee is a member of the Compensation and Pension Committee. The 2006 Plan provides for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control of the Corporation as defined in the 2006 Plan. Option awards can be granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Corporations stock at the date of grant and the Corporation expects option awards generally to vest from one to five years from the date of grant. Dividends are not paid on unexercised options. During 2006, the board of directors approved stock awards totaling 1,363 shares to be issued in 2007. The awards had a value of $32.88 per share based on the closing price of the Corporations stock on the date the board of directors approved the awards. Compensation expense of less than fifty thousand dollars was recognized in 2006 for these stock awards. A summary of stock option activity during the three years ended December 31, 2006 is presented below: Weighted Weighted-Average Average Remaining Aggregate Number of Exercise Price Contractual Terms Intrinsic Value Options Per Share (In years) (In thousands) Outstanding  January 1, 2004 638,520 $ 24.26 Activity during 2004: Granted 188,738 39.69 Exercised (195,695 ) 18.57 Cancelled (5,548 ) 22.15 Outstanding  December 31, 2004 626,015 30.73 Activity during 2005: Granted 177,450 32.28 Exercised (50,562 ) 22.53 Cancelled (7,475 ) 33.33 Outstanding  December 31, 2005 745,428 31.63 Activity during 2006: Granted   Exercised (97,896 ) 21.75 Cancelled (6,038 ) 30.92 Outstanding  December 31, 2006 641,494 $ 33.15 6.76 $ 1,442 Exercisable/vested at December 31, 2006 636,257 $ 33.19 6.77 $ 1,413 The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2006: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Weighted Weighted Average Range of Average Exercise Exercise Exercise Number Price Average Prices Number Price Outstanding Per Share Term (1) Per Share Exercisable Per Share 34,845 $ 23.79 4.36 $ 23.14 - $25.62 34,845 $ 23.79 162,459 27.37 3.45 26.17 - 27.78 157,222 27.36 175,600 32.28 8.97 32.28 175,600 32.28 84,840 35.67 6.95 35.67 84,840 35.67 183,750 39.69 7.95 39.69 183,750 39.69 641,494 $ 33.15 6.76 $ 23.14 - $39.69 636,257 $ 33.19 (1) Weighted average remaining contractual term in years At December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding options with stock appreciation rights. The aggregate intrinsic values of outstanding and exercisable options at December 31, 2006 were calculated based on the closing price of the Corporations stock on December 31, 2006 of $33.30 per share less the exercise price of these options. continued on next page 69 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE R  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED) Outstanding and exercisable options with intrinsic values less than zero, or out-of-the-money options, were not included in the aggregate intrinsic value reported. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, there was less than ten thousand dollars of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation awards outstanding. This cost will be recognized during the first six months of 2007. NOTE S  COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Historically, the majority of the commitments of the Corporations subsidiary bank have not been drawn upon and, therefore, may not represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued generally by the Corporations subsidiary bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in making loans to customers and are subject to the Corporations normal credit policies. Collateral obtained upon exercise of commitments is determined using managements credit evaluation of the borrowers and may include real estate, business assets, deposits and other items. The Corporations subsidiary bank at any point in time also has approved but undisbursed loans. The majority of these undisbursed loans will convert to booked loans within a three-month period. At December 31, 2006, total unused loan commitments, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans were $402 million, $45 million and $165 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005, total unused loan commitments, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans were $368 million, $54 million and $169 million, respectively. Mortgage loan commitments to customers, which are included in undisbursed loans, totaled $5.8 million at December 31, 2006 and $5.2 million at December 31, 2005. A significant portion of the unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2006 expire one year from their contract date; however, $43 million of unused loan commitments extend for more than five years. The Corporations unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit have been estimated to have no realizable fair value, as historically the majority of the unused loan commitments have not been drawn upon and generally the Corporations subsidiary bank does not receive fees in connection with these agreements. The Corporation has operating leases and other non-cancelable contractual obligations on buildings, equipment, computer software and other expenses that will require annual payments through 2015, including renewal option periods for those building leases that the Corporation expects to renew. Minimum payments due in each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands): 2007 $ 3,748 2008 1,883 2009 1,274 2010 1,035 2011 278 2012 and thereafter 186 Total $ 8,404 Minimum payments include estimates, where applicable, of estimated usage and annual Consumer Price Index increases of approximately 3%. Total expense recorded under operating leases and other non-cancelable contractual obligations was $3.6 million in 2006 and 2005 and $1.8 million in 2004. The Corporation and its bank subsidiary are subject to certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated net income or financial position of the Corporation. 70 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE T  REGULATORY CAPITAL AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS Banking regulations require that banks maintain cash reserve balances in vault cash, with the Federal Reserve Bank, or with certain other qualifying banks. The aggregate average amount of such legal balances required to be maintained by the Corporations subsidiary bank was $26.8 million during 2006 and $27.2 million during 2005. During 2006, the Corporations subsidiary bank satisfied its legal reserve requirements almost entirely by maintaining vault cash balances in excess of legal reserve requirements. The Corporations subsidiary bank did not maintain significant compensating balances with correspondent banks during 2006 or 2005. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on the transfer of assets in the form of dividends, loans or advances from the subsidiary bank to the Corporation. At December 31, 2006, substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary bank were restricted from transfer to the Corporation in the form of loans or advances. Dividends from its subsidiary bank are the principal source of funds for the Corporation. Under the most restrictive of these regulations, the aggregate amount of dividends that can be paid by Chemical Bank to the parent company, without obtaining prior approval from bank regulatory agencies, was $45.9 million as of December 31, 2006. Dividends paid to the Corporation by its bank subsidiary totaled $28.0 million in 2006, $27.0 million in 2005 and $37.6 million in 2004. In addition to the statutory limits, the Corporation considers the overall financial and capital position of the subsidiary bank prior to making any cash dividend decisions. The Corporation and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Under these capital requirements, the subsidiary bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. In addition, capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporations consolidated financial statements. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require minimum ratios of Tier 1 capital to average assets (Leverage Ratio), and Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets. These capital guidelines assign risk weights to on- and off-balance sheet items in arriving at total risk-weighted assets. Minimum capital levels are based upon the perceived risk of various asset categories and certain off-balance sheet instruments. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Corporations and its subsidiary banks capital ratios exceeded the quantitative capital ratios required for an institution to be considered well-capitalized. Significant factors that may affect capital adequacy include, but are not limited to, a disproportionate growth in assets versus capital and a change in mix or credit quality of assets. The table below compares the Corporations and its subsidiary banks actual capital amounts and ratios with the quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy at December 31, 2006: December 31, 2006 Risk-Based Capital Leverage Tier 1 Total Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in millions) Corporations capital $ 440 12 % $ 440 16 % $ 474 18 % Required capital  minimum 111 3 108 4 217 8 Required capital  well capitalized definition 185 5 163 6 271 10 Chemical Banks capital 432 12 432 16 466 17 Required capital  minimum 111 3 108 4 216 8 Required capital  well capitalized definition 185 5 162 6 270 10 continued on next page 71 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE T  REGULATORY CAPITAL AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS (CONTINUED) December 31, 2005 Risk-Based Capital Leverage Tier 1 Total Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in millions) Corporations capital $ 438 12 % $ 438 17 % $ 471 18 % Required capital  minimum 111 3 106 4 212 8 Required capital  well capitalized definition 185 5 159 6 265 10 Chemical Banks capital 416 11 416 16 449 17 Required capital  minimum 112 3 106 4 212 8 Required capital  well capitalized definition 187 5 159 6 265 10 NOTE U  DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SFAS No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments (SFAS 107), requires disclosures about the estimated fair values of the Corporations financial instruments. The Corporation utilized quoted market prices, where available, to compute the fair values of its financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices were not available, the Corporation used present value methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. These estimates of fair value are significantly affected by the assumptions made and, accordingly, do not necessarily indicate amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. It is also the Corporations general practice and intent to hold the majority of its financial instruments until maturity and, therefore, the Corporation does not expect to realize the estimated amounts disclosed. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments: Cash and cash due from banks: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial position for cash and cash due from banks approximate their fair values. Interest-bearing deposits with unaffiliated banks and federal funds sold: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial position for interest-bearing deposits with unaffiliated banks and federal funds sold approximate their fair values. Investment securities: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices. Other securities: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial position for other securities approximate their fair values. Loans held for sale: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial position for loans held for sale approximate their fair values. Loans: For variable interest rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values for fixed-interest rate loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The resulting amounts are adjusted to estimate the effect of declines in the credit quality of borrowers after the loans were originated. 72 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Interest receivable: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial position for interest receivable approximate their fair values. Deposit liabilities: The fair values of deposit accounts without defined maturities, such as interest- and noninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts, are equal to the amounts payable on demand. Fair values for interest-bearing deposits (time deposits) with defined maturities are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows, using interest rates currently being offered for deposits of similar maturities. The fair values for variable-interest rate certificates of deposit approximate their carrying amounts. Interest payable: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial position for interest payable approximate their fair values. Short-term borrowings: Short-term borrowings consist of repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB advances. Fair value is estimated for repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB advances based on the present value of future estimated cash flows using current rates offered to the Corporation for debt with similar terms. FHLB advances  long-term: Fair value is estimated based on the present value of future estimated cash flows using current rates offered to the Corporation for debt with similar terms. Commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans: The Corporations unused loan commitments, standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans have no carrying amount and have been estimated to have no realizable fair value. Historically, a majority of the unused loan commitments have not been drawn upon and, generally, the Corporation does not receive fees in connection with these commitments. Estimates of fair values have not been made for items that are not defined by SFAS 107 as financial instruments, including such items as the Corporations core deposits and the value of its trust and investment management services department. The Corporation believes it is impractical to estimate a representative fair value for these types of assets, even though management believes they add significant value to the Corporation.
