Risk Factors Â– continued We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and environmental considerations Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations that affect every aspect of our business such as environmental, hazardous waste and land use requirements and can result in substantial expense to the company. By way of example, should hazardous waste be discovered on land that we own, we could incur the expense of removal and remediation. Certain events could trigger the acceleration of payment of the 4.50% Notes Certain events, including cessation of trading of our common stock, failure to pay interest when due on our 4.50% Notes, final judgment(s) for the payment of money in excess of $20,000 rendered against us or any of our subsidiaries if not discharged for any periods of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement is not in effect, could result in a default under our 4.50% Notes. Such default would result in the requirement for payment of the 4.50% Notes prior to the due date thereof. Our inability to make such accelerated payment could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 10 Table of Contents
