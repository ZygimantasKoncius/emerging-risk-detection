PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Background Pacific Mercantile Bancorp is a California corporation that owns 100% of the stock of Pacific Mercantile Bank, a California state chartered commercial bank (which, for convenience, will sometimes be referred to in this report as the Bank). The capital stock of the Bank is our principal asset and substantially all of our business operations are conducted by the Bank which, as a result, accounts for substantially all of our revenues and income. As the owner of a commercial bank, Pacific Mercantile Bancorp is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Bank Holding Company Act) and, as such, our operations are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board). See Supervision and Regulation below in this Report. For ease of reference, we will sometimes use the terms Company, we or us in this Report to refer to Pacific Mercantile Bancorp on a consolidated basis and PM Bancorp or the Bancorp to refer to Pacific Mercantile Bancorp on a stand-alone or unconsolidated basis. The Bank, which is headquartered in Orange County, California, approximately 40 miles south of Los Angeles, conducts a commercial banking business in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties in Southern California. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured, to the maximum extent permitted by law, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (commonly known as the FDIC). At December 31, 2011, our total assets, net loans (which exclude loans held for sale) and total deposits were $1.025 billion, $641 million and $862 million, respectively. Additionally, as of that date a total of approximately 8,200 deposit accounts were being maintained at the Bank by our customers, of which approximately 34% were business customers. Currently we operate seven full service commercial banking offices (which we refer to as financial centers) and an online banking branch at www.pmbank.com. Due to the Banks online presence, the Bank has customers who are located in 49 states and the District of Columbia, although the vast majority of our customers are located in Southern California. 1 Table of Contents The Bank commenced business in March 1999, with the opening of its first financial center, located in Newport Beach, California, and in April 1999 it launched its online banking site, at www.pmbank.com, where our customers are able to conduct many of their business and personal banking transactions, more conveniently and less expensively, with us, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Between August 1999 and July 2005, we opened six additional financial centers as part of an expansion of our banking franchise into Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino counties in Southern California. Set forth below is information regarding our current financial centers. Banking and Financial Center County Date Opened for Business Newport Beach, California Orange March 1999 San Juan Capistrano, California Orange August 1999 Costa Mesa, California Orange June 2001 Beverly Hills, California Los Angeles July 2001 La Jolla, California San Diego June 2002 La Habra, California Orange September 2003 Ontario, California San Bernardino July 2005 According to data published by the FDIC, at December 31, 2011 there were approximately 124 commercial banks operating with banking offices located in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino in Southern California. Of those commercial banks, 14 had assets in excess of $2 billion; 91 had assets under $500 million (which are often referred to as community banks); 11 had assets between $500 million and $1 billion, and 8, including our Bank, had assets ranging between $1 billion and $2 billion. As a result, we believe that we are well-positioned to achieve further growth in Southern California. Our Business Strategy Our growth and expansion are the result of our adherence to a business plan which was created by our founders, who include both experienced banking professionals and individuals who came out of the computer industry. That business plan is to build and grow a banking organization that offers its customers the best attributes of a community bank, which are personalized and responsive service, while taking advantage of advances in computer technology to reduce costs and at the same time extend the geographic coverage of our banking franchise, initially within Southern California, by opening additional financial centers and benefiting from opportunities that may arise in the future to acquire other banks. In furtherance of that strategy:  We offer at our financial centers and at our interactive online banking website, a broad selection of financial products and services that address, in particular, the banking needs of business customers and professional firms, including services that are typically available only from larger banks in our market areas.  We provide a level of convenience and access to banking services that we believe are not typically available from the community banks with which we compete, made possible by the combination of our full service financial centers and the online banking capabilities coupled with personal services we offer our customers.  We have built a technology and systems infrastructure that we believe will support the growth and further expansion of our banking franchise in Southern California.  We continue to review and analyze additional opportunities to further enhance our profitability including a return in 2009 to business of originating single family mortgage loans that qualify for resale into the secondary mortgage market. We plan to continue to focus our services and offer products primarily to small to mid-size businesses in order to achieve internal growth of our banking franchise. We believe this focus will enable us to grow our loans and other earning assets and increase our core deposits (consisting of non-interest bearing demand, and lower cost savings and money market deposits), with the goal of increasing our net interest margins and improving our profitability. We also believe that, with our technology systems in place, we have the capability to significantly increase the volume of banking transactions without having to incur the cost or disruption of a major computer enhancement program. 2 Table of Contents Our Commercial Banking Operations We seek to meet the banking needs of small and moderate size businesses, professional firms and individuals by providing our customers with:  A broad range of loan and deposit products and banking and financial services, more typical of larger banks, in order to gain a competitive advantage over independent or community banks that do not provide the same range or breadth of services that we are able to provide to our customers;  A high level of personal service and responsiveness, more typical of independent and community banks, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over large out-of-state and other large multi-regional banks that are unable, or unwilling, due to the expense involved, to provide that same level of personal service to this segment of the banking market; and  The added flexibility, convenience and efficiency of conducting banking transactions with us over the Internet, which we believe further differentiates us from many of the community banks with which we compete and enables us to reduce the costs of providing services to our customers. Deposit Products Deposits are a banks principal source of funds for making loans and acquiring other interest earning assets. Additionally, the interest expense that a bank must incur to attract and maintain deposits has a significant impact on its operating results. A banks interest expense, in turn, will be determined in large measure by the types of deposits that it offers to and is able to attract from its customers. Generally, banks seek to attract core deposits which consist of demand deposits that bear no interest and low cost interest-bearing checking, savings and money market deposits. By comparison, time deposits (also sometimes referred to as certificates of deposit), including those in denominations of $100,000 or more, usually bear much higher interest rates and are more interest-rate sensitive and volatile than core deposits. A bank that is not able to attract significant amounts of core deposits must rely on more expensive time deposits or alternative sources of cash, such as Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, to fund interest-earning assets, which means that its costs of funds will be higher and, as a result, its net interest margin is likely to be lower than a bank with higher proportion of core deposits. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations-Net Interest Income. The following table sets forth information regarding the composition, by type of deposits, maintained by our customers during the year ended and as of December 31, 2011: Year-to-DateAverage BalanceDecember 31,2011 Balance atDecember 31,2011 (Dollars in thousands) Type of Deposit Noninterest-bearing checking accounts $ 155,077 $ 164,382 Interest-bearing checking accounts(1) 26,941 29,765 Money market and savings deposits(1) 144,184 158,212 Certificates of deposit(2) 513,619 509,688 Totals $ 839,821 $ 862,047 (1) Includes savings accounts and money market accounts.

The following table sets forth the types and the amounts of our loans that were outstanding: At December 31, 2011 Amount Percent of Total (Dollars in thousands) Commercial loans $ 179,305 27.2 % Commercial real estate loans  owner occupied 170,960 26.0 % Commercial real estate loans  all other 121,813 18.5 % Residential mortgage loans  multi-family 65,545 10.0 % Residential mortgage loans  single family 68,613 10.4 % Construction loans 2,120 0.3 % Land development loans 25,638 3.9 % Consumer loans 24,285 3.7 % Gross loans $ 658,279 100.0 % Commercial Loans The commercial loans we offer generally include short-term secured and unsecured business and commercial loans with maturities ranging from 12 to 24 months, accounts receivable financing for terms of up to 18 months, equipment and automobile term loans and leases which generally amortize over a period of up to 7 years, and SBA guaranteed business loans with terms of up to 10 years. The interest rates on these loans generally are adjustable and usually are indexed to The Wall Street Journals prime rate and will vary based on market conditions and commensurate to the credit risk. However, since 2003 it generally has been our practice to establish an interest rate floor on a best effort basis on our commercial loans. In order to mitigate the risk of borrower default, we generally require collateral to support the credit or, in the case of loans made to businesses, personal guarantees from their owners, or both. In addition, all such loans must have well-defined primary and secondary sources of repayment. Generally, lines of credit are granted for no more than a 12-month period. Commercial loans, including accounts receivable financing, generally are made to businesses that have been in operation for at least three years. To qualify for such loans, prospective borrowers generally must have debt-to-net worth ratios not exceeding 4-to-1, operating cash flow sufficient to demonstrate the ability to pay obligations as they become due, and good payment histories as evidenced by credit reports. We also offer asset-based lending products, which involve a higher degree of risk because they generally are made to businesses that are growing rapidly, but cannot internally fund their growth without borrowings. These loans are collateralized primarily by the borrowers accounts receivable and inventory. We control our risk by generally requiring loan-to-value ratios of not more than 80% and by closely and regularly monitoring the amount and value of the collateral in order to maintain that ratio. Commercial loan growth is important to the growth and profitability of our banking franchise because, although not required to do so, commercial loan borrowers often establish noninterest-bearing (demand) and interest-bearing transaction deposit accounts and banking services relationships with us. Those deposit accounts help us to reduce our overall cost of funds and those banking services relationships provide us with a source of non-interest income. Commercial Real Estate Loans The majority of our commercial real estate loans are secured by first trust deeds on nonresidential real property. Loans secured by nonresidential real estate often involve loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, and generally involve a greater risk of nonpayment than do mortgage loans secured by multi-family dwellings. Payments on these loans depend to a large degree on the results of operations and cash flows of the borrowers, which are generated from a wide variety of businesses and industries. As a result, repayment of these loans can be affected adversely by changes in the economy in general or by the real estate market more specifically. Accordingly, the nature of this type of loan makes it more difficult to monitor and evaluate. Consequently, we typically require personal guarantees from the owners of the businesses to which we make such loans. 4 Table of Contents Customers desiring to obtain commercial real estate loans are required to have good payment records with a debt coverage ratio generally of at least 1.25 to 1. In addition, we require adequate insurance on the properties securing those loans to protect the collateral value. These loans are generally adjustable rate loans with interest rates tied to a variety of independent indexes. However, in some instances, the interest rates on these loans are fixed for an initial five year period and then adjust thereafter based on an applicable index. These loans are generally written for terms of up to 10 years, with loan-to-value ratios of not more than 75% in the case of owner occupied properties and 65% on non-owner occupied properties. Residential Mortgage Loans  Multi-family We make multi-family residential mortgage loans primarily in Southern California for terms up to 30 years. These loans generally are adjustable rate loans with interest rates tied to a variety of independent indexes; although in some cases these loans have fixed interest rates for an initial five-year period and adjust thereafter based on an applicable index. These loans generally have interest rate floors, payment caps, and prepayment penalties. The loans are underwritten based on a variety of borrower and property criteria. Borrower criteria include liquidity and cash flow analysis and credit history verifications. Property criteria generally include loan to value limits under 75% and debt coverage ratios of 1.20 to 1 or greater. Residential Mortgage Loans  Single-family During the second quarter of 2009, we commenced a new mortgage banking business to originate residential real estate mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by single-family residential properties. The majority of loans are held for sale to third-party investors into the secondary mortgage markets; however, a percentage of adjustable rate mortgage loans are held for investment. We offer a variety of loan products catering to the specific needs of borrowers, including fixed rate and adjustable rate, conventional and government insured (Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veteran Affairs (VA)) mortgages with either 30-year or 15-year terms. We also offer jumbo loans that meet conventional underwriting criteria except that the loan amount exceeds Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac limits. Mortgage loans originated by the Bank are generally secured by a first lien on the underlying property. The Bank does not originate loans defined as high cost by state or federal regulators or that do not comply with applicable agency or investor-specific underwriting guidelines. The majority of residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank have been made to finance the purchase of, or the refinance of existing loans on, owner-occupied homes, with a smaller percentage used to finance non-owner occupied homes. The majority of the Banks loan originations are collateralized by real properties located in Southern California; however the Bank originates loans throughout California and in 17 states. The mortgage lending business is subject to seasonality, and the overall demand for mortgage loans is driven largely by the applicable interest rates at any given time. The Bank handles loan processing, underwriting and closings at its headquarters in Costa Mesa. The Bank sells a majority of the mortgage loans it originates to various investors in the secondary market and does not service these loans after sale of the loans. Loans sold are subject to certain indemnification provisions with investors, including the repurchase of loans sold and the repayment of sales proceeds to investors under certain conditions. In addition, if a customer defaults on a mortgage payment shortly after the loan is originated, the purchaser of the loan may require us to repurchase the loan at the full amount paid by the purchaser. Mortgage loans held for investment are serviced by the Bank. The Bank has grown its residential mortgage business from originating approximately $217 million in loans in 2010 with approximately 94 employees at December 31, 2010, to originating approximately $370 million in loans in 2011 with approximately 212 employees at December 31, 2011. Real Estate Construction and Land Development Loans To reduce our exposure to the deteriorating conditions in the real estate markets, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we began reducing the volume of single family residential and real estate construction loans that we were making, while at the same time increasing our commercial and business lending. Moreover, in 2009 we essentially ceased all real estate construction lending. Consumer Loans We offer a variety of loan and credit products to consumers including personal installment loans, lines of credit, credit cards, and to high net-worth individuals for estate planning based upon cash surrender value life insurance. We design these products to meet the needs of our customers, and some are made at fixed rates of interest and others at adjustable rates of 5 Table of Contents interest. Consumer loans often entail greater risk than real estate mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles, that may not provide an adequate source of repayment in the event of a default by the consumer. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowers ongoing financial stability. Furthermore, in the event a consumer files for bankruptcy protection, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. To qualify for a consumer loan a prospective borrower must have a good payment record and, typically, debt ratios of not more than 45%. Consumer loans and credit products are important because consumers are a source of noninterest-bearing checking accounts and low cost savings deposits. Additionally, banking relationships with consumers tend to be stable and longer lasting than banking relationships with businesses, which tend to be more sensitive to price competition. Business Banking Services We offer various banking and financial services designed primarily for our business banking customers. Those services include:  Financial management tools and services that include multiple account control, account analysis, transaction security and verification, wire transfers, bill payment, payroll and lock box services, most of which are available at our Internet website, www.pmbank.com; and  Automated clearinghouse (ACH) origination services which enable businesses that charge for their services or products on a recurring monthly or other periodic basis, to obtain payment from their customers through an automatic, pre-authorized debit from their customers bank accounts anywhere in the United States. Convenience Banking Services We also offer a number of services and products that make it more convenient to conduct banking transactions with us, such as online banking services, ATMs, night drop services, courier and armored car services that enable our business customers to order and receive cash without having to travel to our banking offices, and Remote Deposit Capture (PMB Xpress Deposit) which enables business customers to image checks they receive for electronic deposit at the Bank, thereby eliminating the need for customers to travel to our offices to deposit checks into their accounts. Online Banking Services Our customers can securely access our online bank at www.pmbank.com to:  Use financial cash management tools and services  View account balances and account history  Transfer funds between accounts  Pay bills and order wire transfers of funds  Transfer funds from credit lines to deposit accounts  Make loan payments  Print bank statements  Place stop payments  Purchase certificates of deposit Security Measures Our ability to provide customers with secure and uninterrupted financial services is of paramount importance to our business. We believe our computer banking systems, services and software meet the highest standards of bank and electronic systems security. The following are among the security measures that we have implemented: Bank-Wide Security Measures  Service Continuity. In order to better ensure continuity of service, we have located our critical servers and telecommunications systems at an offsite hardened and secure data center. This center provides the physical environment necessary to keep servers up and running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This data center has raised floors, temperature control systems with separate cooling zones, seismically braced racks, and generators to keep the system operating during power outages and has been designed to withstand fires and major earthquakes. The center also has a wide range of physical security features, including smoke detection and fire suppression 6 Table of Contents systems, motion sensors, and 24x7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and security breach alarms. The center is connected to the Internet by redundant high speed data circuits with advanced capacity monitoring.  Physical Security. All servers and network computers reside in secure facilities. Only employees with proper identification may enter the primary server areas.  Monitoring. All customer transactions on our online servers and internal computer systems produce one or more entries into transactional logs. Our personnel routinely review these logs as a means of identifying and taking appropriate action with respect to any abnormal or unusual activity. We believe that, ultimately, vigilant monitoring is the best defense against fraud. Internet Security Measures We maintain electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard nonpublic personal information. We regularly assess and update our systems to improve our technology for protecting information. On our website, the security measures include:  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol,  Digital certificates,  Multi-factor authentication (MFA),  Intrusion detection/prevention systems, and  Firewall protection. We believe the risk of fraud presented by online banking is not materially different from the risk of fraud inherent in any banking relationship. Potential security breaches can arise from any of the following circumstances:  misappropriation of a customers account number or password;  compromise of the customers computer system;  penetration of our servers by an outside hacker;  fraud committed by a new customer in completing his or her loan application or opening a deposit account with us; and  fraud committed by employees or service providers. Both traditional banks and internet banks are vulnerable to these types of fraud. By establishing the security measures described above, we believe we can minimize, to the extent practicable, our vulnerability to the first three types of fraud. To counteract fraud by employees and service providers, we have established internal procedures and policies designed to ensure that, as in any bank, proper control and supervision is exercised over employees and service providers. We also maintain insurance to protect us from losses due to fraud committed by employees or through breaches in our cyber security. Additionally, the adequacy of our security measures is reviewed periodically by the Federal Reserve Board and the California Department of Financial Institutions (DFI), which are the federal and state government agencies, respectively, with supervisory authority over the Bank. We also retain the services of third party computer security firms to conduct periodic tests of our computer and online banking systems to identify potential threats to the security of our systems and to recommend additional actions that we can take to improve our security measures. Competition Competitive Conditions in the Traditional Banking Environment The banking business in California generally, and in our service area in particular, is highly competitive and is dominated by a relatively small number of large multi-state and California-based banks that have numerous banking offices operating over wide geographic areas. We compete for deposits and loans with those banks, with community banks that are based or have branch offices in our market areas, and with savings banks (also sometimes referred to as thrifts), credit unions, money market and other mutual funds, stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other traditional and nontraditional financial service organizations. We also compete for customers funds with governmental and private entities issuing debt or equity securities or other forms of investments which may offer different and potentially higher yields than those available through bank deposits. Major financial institutions that operate throughout California and that have offices in our service areas include Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, Jpmorgan Chase, Union Bank of California, Bank of the West, U. S. Bancorp, Comerica Bank and Citibank. Larger independent banks and other financial institutions with offices in our service areas include, among others, OneWest Bank, City National Bank, Citizens Business Bank, Manufacturers Bank, and California Bank and Trust. 7 Table of Contents These banks, as well many other financial institutions in our service areas, have the financial capability to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift their resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability. Many of them also offer diversified financial services which we do not presently offer directly. The larger banks and financial institutions also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits than our Bank. In order to compete with the banks and other financial institutions operating in our service areas, we rely on our ability to provide flexible, more convenient and more personalized service to customers, including online banking services and financial tools. At the same time, we:  emphasize personal contacts with existing and potential new customers by our directors, officers and other employees;  develop and participate in local promotional activities; and  seek to develop specialized or streamlined services for customers. To the extent customers desire loans in excess of our lending limits or services not offered by us, we attempt to assist them in obtaining such loans or other services through participations with other banks or assistance from our correspondent banks or third party vendors. Competitive Conditions in Online Banking There are a number of banks that offer services exclusively over the internet, such as E*TRADE Bank, and other banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, that market their internet banking services to their customers nationwide. We believe that only the larger of the commercial banks with which we compete offer the comprehensive set of online banking tools and services that we offer to our customers. However, an increasing number of community banks offer internet banking services to their customers by relying on third party vendors to provide the functionality they need to provide such services. Additionally, many of the larger banks have greater market presence and greater financial resources to market their internet banking services than do we. Moreover, new competitors and competitive factors are likely to emerge, particularly in view of the rapid development of internet commerce. On the other hand, there have been some recently published reports indicating that the actual rate of growth in the use of the internet banking services by consumers and businesses is lower than had been previously predicted and that many customers still prefer to be able to conduct at least some of their banking transactions at local banking offices. We believe that these findings support our strategic decision, made at the outset of our business, to offer customers the benefits of both traditional and online banking services. We also believe that this strategy has been an important factor in our growth to date and will contribute to our growth in the future. See BUSINESS  Our Business Strategy earlier in this Section of this Report. Impact of Economic Conditions, Government Policies and Legislation on our Business Government Monetary Policies. Our profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is affected to a significant extent by our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we generate on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest we pay on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, such as borrowings. Our interest income and interest expense, and hence our net interest income, depends to a great extent on prevailing market rates of interest, which are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including inflation, recession and unemployment. Moreover, it is often difficult to predict, with any assurance, how changes in economic conditions of this nature will affect our future financial performance. Our net interest income and operating results also are affected by monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policies to curb inflation, or to stimulate borrowing and spending in response to economic downturns, through its open-market operations by adjusting the required level of reserves that banks and other depository institutions must maintain, and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates on borrowings by banks and other depository institutions. These actions affect the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and the interest earned on interest-earning assets and paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies on us cannot be predicted with any assurance. Legislation Generally. From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted which can affect our operations and our operating results by materially increasing the costs of doing business, limiting or expanding the activities in which banks and other financial institutions may engage, or altering the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. 8 Table of Contents Economic Conditions and Recent Legislation and Other Government Actions. The recent economic recession, which is reported to have begun at the end of 2007, created wide ranging consequences and difficulties for the banking and financial services industry, in particular, and the economy in general. The recession led to significant write-downs of the assets and an erosion of the capital of a large number of banks and other lending and financial institutions which, in turn, significantly and adversely affected the operating results of banking and other financial institutions, many of which reported losses for the three years ended December 31, 2010, and led to steep declines in their stock prices. In addition, bank regulatory agencies have been very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in their bank examinations, which has resulted in the increased issuance of enforcement orders requiring banks to take actions to address credit quality, liquidity and risk management and capital adequacy, as well as other safety and soundness concerns. All of these conditions, moreover, led the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury Department and the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC, to take broad actions, to address systemic risks and volatility in the U.S. banking system. The Dodd-Frank Act On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changes federal banking regulation. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic risks in the banking and financial system and gives federal regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate banking institutions and other financial firms facing the prospect of imminent failure that would create systemic risks to the U.S. financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act also creates a new independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws. The Dodd-Frank Act is expected to have a significant impact on banks and bank holding companies generally and we expect that many of its provisions will impact our business operations as they take effect. However, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall impact of that Act on the Company and the Bank. Set forth below is a summary description of some of the key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may affect us. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Dodd-Frank Act itself. Imposition of New Capital Standards on Bank Holding Companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to apply consolidated capital requirements to depository institution holding companies, such as us, that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions, such as the Bank. Under these standards, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company with less 9 Table of Contents than $15 billion in assets. Since our trust preferred securities were issued prior to 2010 and our assets total approximately $1 billion, our trust preferred securities will continue to be included in our Tier 1 capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that capital be increased in times of economic expansion and allowed to decrease in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. Increase in Deposit Insurance and Changes Affecting the FDIC Insurance Fund. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, and extended unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2012. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts, which is likely to increase the competition for and interest that banks pay on such accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, which may result in increases in FDIC insurance assessments for many FDIC insured banks. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Say-on-Pay and other Executive Compensation Provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies, including those that are depository institutions or bank holding companies, to give their shareholders a non-binding votes (i) on executive compensation and (ii) on so-called golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions that will trigger such payments. The SEC has already promulgated its rules for implementing these say-on-pay provisions, which required all public companies, other than smaller reporting companies, to give their shareholders the opportunity to vote on executive compensation at their shareholders meetings held in 2011. Smaller reporting Companies will have to begin holding say on pay votes at their first annual shareholders meetings held on or after January 21, 2013. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting the payment of excessive compensation to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, whether or not they are publicly traded. Limitation on Conversion of Bank Charters. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a depository institution from converting from a state to federal charter or vice versa while it is the subject of a cease and desist order or other formal enforcement action or a memorandum of understanding with respect to a significant supervisory matter unless the appropriate federal banking agency gives notice of the conversion to the federal or state regulatory agency that issued the enforcement action and that agency does not object within 30 days. Interstate Banking. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely. Restrictions on Derivative Transactions. Effective 18 months after enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits state-chartered banks from engaging in derivatives transactions unless the legal lending limits of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration credit exposure to derivatives transactions. For this purpose, derivative transactions include any contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note or option that is based in whole or in part on the value of, any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one or more commodities securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices or other assets. Extension of Limitations on Banking Transactions by Banks with their Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act will apply Section 23A and Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (governing transactions with insiders) to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider. Any such transactions with affiliates must be fully secured. The current exemption from Section 23A for transactions with financial subsidiaries will be eliminated. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act expands the definition of affiliate for purposes of quantitative and qualitative limitations of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include mutual funds advised by a depository institution or its affiliates. 10 Table of Contents Debit Card Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the card issuer and requires, the Federal Reserve Board to establish standards for reasonable and proportional fees which may take into account the costs of preventing fraud. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a rule, effective October 1, 2011, which limits interchange fees on debit card transactions to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. A debit card issuer may recover an additional one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board. Although, as a technical matter, this new limitation applies only to institutions with assets of more than $10 billion, it is expected that many smaller institutions will reduce their interchange fees in order to remain competitive with the larger institutions that are required to comply with this new limitation. Consumer Protection Provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act also (i), authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrowers ability to repay and (ii) will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Supervision and Regulation Both federal and state laws extensively regulate bank holding companies and banks. Such regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDICs deposit insurance fund and is not for the benefit of shareholders. Set forth below is a summary description of the material laws and regulations that affect or bear on our operations. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the laws and regulations that are summarized below. Pacific Mercantile Bancorp General. Pacific Mercantile Bancorp is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Pursuant to that Act, we are subject to supervision and periodic examination by, and are required to file periodic reports with, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board or the FRB). As a bank holding company, we are allowed to engage, directly or indirectly, only in banking and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board deems to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Business activities designated by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking include securities brokerage services and products and data processing services, among others. As a bank holding company, we also are required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the acquisition of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities, or of substantially all of the assets, by merger or purchases of (i) any bank or other bank holding company and (ii) any other entities engaged in banking-related businesses or that provide banking-related services. Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve Boards policy that, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. For that reason, among others, the Federal Reserve Board requires all bank holding companies to maintain capital at or above certain prescribed levels. A bank holding companys failure to meet these requirements will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Boards regulations or both, which could lead to the imposition of restrictions on the offending bank holding company, including restrictions on its further growth. See the discussion below under the caption Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action. Additionally, among its powers, the Federal Reserve Board may require any bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of, or liquidate or divest itself of, any subsidiary or affiliated company that the Federal Reserve Board determines constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company or 11 Table of Contents any of its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board also has the authority to regulate provisions of a bank holding companys debt, including authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt. Subject to certain exceptions, bank holding companies also are required to file written notice and obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board prior to purchasing or redeeming their common stock or other equity securities. A bank holding company and its non-banking subsidiaries also are prohibited from implementing so-called tying arrangements whereby customers may be required to use or purchase services or products from the bank holding company or any of its non-bank subsidiaries in order to obtain a loan or other services from any of the holding companys subsidiary banks. The Company also is a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. As such, we are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Financial Institutions. Financial Services Modernization Legislation. The Financial Services Modernization Act, which also is known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, was enacted into law in 1999. The principal objectives of that Act were to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities and investment banking firms, and other financial service providers. Accordingly, the Act revised and expanded the Bank Holding Company Act to permit a bank holding company system, meeting certain specified qualifications, to engage in broader range of financial activities to foster greater competition among financial services companies. To accomplish those objectives, among other things, the Act repealed the two affiliation provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that had been adopted in the early 1930s during the Depression: Section 20, which restricted the affiliation of Federal Reserve Member Banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities; and Section 32, which restricted officer, director, or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities. The Financial Services Modernization Act also contains provisions that expressly preempt and make unenforceable any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations, primarily related to insurance. That Act also:  broadened the activities that may be conducted by national banks, bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, and their financial subsidiaries;  provided an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information;  adopted a number of provisions related to the capitalization, membership, corporate governance, and other measures designed to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank system;  modified the laws governing the implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act (which is described in greater detail below); and  addressed a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term activities of banking institutions. Before a bank holding company may engage in any of the financial activities authorized by that Act, it must file an application with its Federal Reserve Bank that confirms that it meets certain qualitative eligibility requirements established by the FRB. A bank holding company that meets those qualifications and files such an application will be designated as a financial holding company, as a result of which it will become entitled to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities, primarily through non-banking subsidiaries, that are financial in nature or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. According to current Federal Reserve Board regulations, activities that are financial in nature and may be engaged in by financial holding companies, through their non-bank subsidiaries, include:  securities underwriting; dealing and market making;  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies;  engaging in insurance underwriting and brokerage; and  engaging in merchant banking activities. A bank holding company that does not qualify as a financial holding company may not engage in such financial activities. Instead, as discussed above, it is limited to engaging in banking and such other activities that have been determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. We have no current plans to engage in any activities not permitted to traditional bank holding companies, including those expressly permitted by the Financial Services Modernization Act and we are not a financial holding company. Privacy Provisions of the Financial Services Modernization Act. As required by the Financial Services Modernization Act, federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. Pursuant to the rules, financial institutions must provide:  initial notices to customers about their privacy policies, describing the conditions under which banks and other financial institutions may disclose non-public personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties and affiliates; 12 Table of Contents  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers; and  a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (i) established requirements with respect to oversight and supervision of public accounting firms, and (ii) required the implementation of measures designed to improve corporate governance of companies with securities registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (public companies) and which, therefore, apply to us. Among other things, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act:  Provided for the establishment of a five-member oversight board, known as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB), which is appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that is empowered to set standards for and has investigative and disciplinary authority over accounting firms that audit the financial statements of public companies.  Prohibits public accounting firms from providing various types of consulting services to their public company clients and requires accounting firms to rotate partners among public company clients every five years in order to assure that public accountants maintain their independence from managements of the companies whose financial statements they audit.  Increased the criminal penalties for financial crimes and securities fraud.  Requires public companies to implement disclosure controls and procedures designed to assure that material information regarding their business and financial performance is included in the public reports they file under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act Reports).  Requires the chief executive and chief financial officers of public companies to certify as to the accuracy and completeness of the Exchange Act Reports that their companies file, the financial statements included in those Reports and the effectiveness of their disclosure procedures and controls.  Requires, pursuant to Section 404 of the Act, that (i) the chief executive and chief financial officer of a public company to test and certify to the effectiveness of their companys internal control over financial reporting, and (ii) a public companys outside auditors to independently test and issue a report as to whether the companys internal control over its financial reporting is effective and whether there are any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in those financial controls.  Requires a majority of the directors of public company to be independent of the companys management and that the directors that serve on a public companys audit committee meet standards of independence that are more stringent than those that apply to non-management directors generally.  Requires public companies whose publicly traded securities have a value in excess of $75 million to file their Exchange Act Reports on a more accelerated basis than had been required prior to the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Requires more expeditious reporting by directors and officers and other public company insiders regarding their trading in company securities.  Established statutory separations between investment banking firms and financial analysts. We have taken the actions required by, and we believe we are in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are applicable to us. Among other things, we have implemented disclosure controls and procedures and taken other actions to meet the expanded disclosure requirements and certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, such as testing our internal control over financial reporting. We also have determined that eight of our nine directors meet the independence requirements of, and that all members of our audit committee meet the more stringent standards of independence applicable to audit committee membership pursuant to, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In January 2010, we determined that it was necessary to increase the allowance for loan losses and, therefore, restate our previously issued unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 based on a determination that greater weight should have been given to qualitative reserve factors in determining the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2009. As a result, we reassessed, and identified a material weakness in the Companys disclosure controls and in its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009. To remediate that material weakness, management modified its policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for loan losses to give greater weight to the impact that qualitative factors can reasonably be expected to have on the performance and collectability of loans in the loan portfolio. As a result of these actions, management concluded that this material weakness had been satisfactorily remediated as of June 30, 2010 and management has determined that there has been no recurrence of that or any other material weakness in our disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting since then. See Item 9A in Part II of this Report regarding our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. 13 Table of Contents Pacific Mercantile Bank General. Pacific Mercantile Bank (the Bank) is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by (i) the Federal Reserve Board, which is its primary federal banking regulator, because the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and (ii) the DFI, because the Bank is a California state chartered bank. The Bank also is subject to certain of the regulations promulgated by the FDIC, because its deposits are insured by the FDIC. Various requirements and restrictions under the Federal and California banking laws affect the operations of the Bank. These laws and the implementing regulations, which are promulgated by Federal and State regulatory agencies, cover most aspects of a banks operations, including the reserves a bank must maintain against deposits and for possible loan losses and other contingencies; the types of deposits it obtains and the interest it is permitted to pay on different types of deposit accounts; the loans and investments that a bank may make; the borrowings that a bank may incur; the number and location of banking offices that a bank may establish; the rate at which it may grow its assets; the acquisition and merger activities of a bank; the amount of dividends that a bank may pay; and the capital requirements that a bank must satisfy, which can determine the extent of supervisory control to which a bank will be subject by its federal and state bank regulators. A more detailed discussion regarding capital requirements that are applicable to us and the Bank is set forth below under the caption Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action. and Action by the FRB and DFI. Permissible Activities and Subsidiaries. California law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Those permissible activities include conducting many so-called closely related to banking or nonbanking activities either directly or through their operating subsidiaries. Interstate Banking and Branching. Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, bank holding companies and banks generally have the ability to acquire or merge with banks in other states; and, subject to certain state restrictions, banks may also acquire or establish new branches outside their home states. Interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located. The Bank presently does not have any interstate branches. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of San Francisco. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region and makes available loans or advances to its member banks. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2011, the Bank was in compliance with the FHLBs stock ownership requirement. Historically, the FHLB has paid dividends on its capital stock to its members. FRB Deposit Reserve Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board requires all federally-insured depository institutions to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts. At December 31, 2011, the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. If, as a result of an examination of a federally regulated bank, its primary federal bank regulatory agency, such as the Federal Reserve Board, were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of a banks operations had become unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, that agency has the authority to take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. These actions include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound banking practices; to require that affirmative action be taken to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced; to require the bank to increase its capital; to restrict the banks growth; to assess civil monetary penalties against the bank or its officers or directors; to remove officers and directors of the bank; and, if the federal agency concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate a banks deposit insurance, which in the case of a California chartered bank would result in revocation of its charter and require it to cease its banking operations. Additionally, under California law the DFI has many of the same remedial powers with respect to the Bank, because it is a California state chartered bank. Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds. Cash dividends from the Bank constitute the primary source of cash available to PM Bancorp for its operations and to fund any cash dividends that the board of directors might declare in the future. PM Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and the Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory 14 Table of Contents restrictions on its ability to pay cash dividends to PM Bancorp. Those restrictions would prohibit the Bank, subject to certain limited exceptions, from paying cash dividends in amounts that would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board and the DFI have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends, if either of those authorities deems the payment of dividends by the Bank to be an unsafe or unsound practice. See Action by the FRB and DFI below and Dividend PolicyRestrictions on the Payment of Dividends in Item 5 of this Report. Additionally, it is FRB policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. It is also an FRB policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. Additionally, due to the current financial and economic environment, the FRB has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policies and has discouraged dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. The Federal Reserve Board also has established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by banks and bank holding companies under its jurisdiction. Compliance with the standards set forth in those guidelines and the restrictions that are or may be imposed under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law could limit the amount of dividends which the Bank or the Company may pay. See Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action and Action by the FRB and DFI below in this Section of this Report. Single Borrower Loan Limitations. With certain limited exceptions, the maximum amount of obligations, secured or unsecured, that any borrower (including certain related entities) may owe to a California state bank at any one time may not exceed 25% of the sum of the shareholders equity, allowance for loan losses, capital notes and debentures of the bank. Unsecured obligations may not exceed 15% of the sum of the shareholders equity, allowance for loan losses, capital notes and debentures of the bank. Restrictions on Transactions between the Bank and the Company and its other Affiliates. The Bank is subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to, or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of, the Company or any of its other subsidiaries; the purchase of, or investments in, Company stock or other Company securities and the taking of such securities as collateral for loans; and the purchase of assets from the Company or any of its other subsidiaries. These restrictions prevent the Company and any of its subsidiaries from borrowing from the Bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations in designated amounts, and such secured loans and investments by the Bank in the Company or any of its subsidiaries are limited, individually, to 10% of the Banks capital and surplus (as defined by federal regulations) and, in the aggregate, for all loans made to and investments made in the Company and its other subsidiaries, to 20% of the Banks capital and surplus. California law also imposes restrictions with respect to transactions involving the Company and other persons deemed under that law to control the Bank. Safety and Soundness Standards Banking institutions may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices or for violating any law, rule, regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by its primary federal banking regulatory agency or any written agreement with that agency. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to identify and address potential safety and soundness concerns that could, if not corrected, lead to deterioration in the quality of a banks assets, liquidity or capital. Those guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to such matters as:  internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems;  loan documentation;  credit underwriting;  asset growth;  earnings; and  compensation, fees and benefits. In addition, federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality. These guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating. Under these standards, an FDIC-insured depository institution is expected to:  conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets, estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb those estimated losses; 15 Table of Contents  compare problem asset totals to capital;  take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets;  consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations; and  provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for the banks management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk. These guidelines also establish standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by their federal banking regulators. Among other things, it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan if the depository institutions bank regulator has concluded that it needs additional capital. Supervisory actions by a banks federal regulator under the prompt corrective action rules generally depend upon an institutions classification within one of five capital categories, which is determined on the basis of a banks total capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and leverage ratio. Tier 1 capital consists principally of common stock and nonredeemable preferred stock, retained earnings and, subject to certain limitations, subordinated long term debentures or notes that meet certain conditions established by the Federal Reserve Board. See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Capital Resources in Item 7 in Part II of this Report. A depository institutions capital category under the prompt corrective action regulations will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and the other factors established by the relevant regulations. Those regulations provide that a bank will be:  well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not well capitalized;  undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%;  significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and  critically undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. If a bank that is classified as a well-capitalized institution is determined (after notice and opportunity for hearing), by its federal regulatory agency to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, that agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify the bank as adequately capitalized. If a bank has been classified as adequately capitalized or undercapitalized, its federal regulatory agency may nevertheless require it to comply with bank supervisory provisions and restrictions that would apply to a bank in the next lower capital classification, if that regulatory agency has obtained supervisory information regarding the bank (other than with respect to its capital levels) that raises safety or soundness concerns. However, a significantly undercapitalized bank may not be treated by its regulatory agency as critically undercapitalized. The FDIA generally prohibits a bank from making any capital distributions (including payments of dividends) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The federal regulatory agency for such a bank may not accept its capital restoration plan unless it determines, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the banks capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the banks parent holding company must guarantee that the bank will comply with its capital restoration plan. The bank holding company also is required to provide appropriate assurances of performance. Under such a guarantee and assurance of performance, if the bank fails to comply with its capital restoration plan, the parent holding company may become subject to liability for such failure in an amount up to the lesser of (i) 5.0% of the its bank subsidiarys total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the bank into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time it failed to comply with the plan. 16 Table of Contents If a bank fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, it will be treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. In that event, the banks federal regulatory agency may impose a number of additional requirements and restrictions on the bank, including orders or requirements (i) to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, (ii) to reduce its total assets, and (iii) cease the receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2011, the regulatory capital ratios of the Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) and compares those capital ratios to the federally established capital requirements that must be met for a bank holding company or a bank to be deemed adequately capitalized or well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations that are described above: At December 31, 2011 Actual To Be Classified for Regulatory Purposes As Adequately Capitalized Well Capitalized Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Company 13.4 % At least 8.0 % N/A Bank 13.4 % At least 8.0 % At least 10.0 % Tier I Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Company 12.1 % At least 4.0 % N/A Bank 12.1 % At least 4.0 % At least 6.0 % Tier I Capital to Average Assets Company 9.8 % At least 4.0 % N/A Bank 9.9 % At least 4.0 % At least 5.0 % As the above table indicates, at December 31, 2011 the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) continued to qualify as a well-capitalized institution, and the Company (on a consolidated basis) continued to exceed the capital ratios applicable to bank holding companies, under federally mandated capital standards and federally established prompt corrective action regulations. Basel III Capital Requirements The current risk-based capital guidelines which apply to the Company and the Bank are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each countrys supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply. A new international accord, referred to as Basel II, which emphasizes internal assessment of credit, market and operational risk; supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements, became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the U.S. in 2008 (total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more); and optional for other banks. In January 2009, the Basel Committee proposed to reconsider regulatory-capital standards, supervisory and risk-management requirements and additional disclosures in the final new accord in response to recent worldwide developments. In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as Basel III. The rules adopted to implement these reforms, which will be phased in over a period of years, set new standards for common equity, tier 1 and total capital, determined on a risk-weighted basis for internationally active banks. However, the Basel III rules are likely to be considered by federal banking regulators in the United States in developing new capital standards and regulations applicable to other banks in the United States. However, until such new standards and regulations are adopted, it will not be possible for us to determine the impact that the Basel III rules might have on the Company and the Bank. For internationally active banks based in the United States, some of the more significant of the Basel III capital requirements include:  A minimum ratio of common equity-to-risk weighted assets of 4.5%, plus an additional 2.5% as a capital conservation buffer, by 2019 after a phase-in period;  A minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital-to-risk weighted assets of 6.0% by 2019 after a phase-in period:  A minimum ratio of total capital-to-risk weighted assets, plus the additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer, of 10.5% by 2019 after a phase-in period;  An additional countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed by applicable national banking regulators periodically at their discretion, with advance notice;  Restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses applicable when capital ratios fall within the buffer zone;  A deduction from common equity of deferred tax assets that depend on future profitability to be realized;  Increased capital requirements for counterparty credit risk relating to OTC derivatives, repos and securities financing activities; and  A loss-absorbency requirement for capital instruments issued on or after January 13, 2013 (other than common equity) which would require the instrument to be written off or converted to common equity if a trigger event occurs, either pursuant to applicable law or at the direction of the banking regulator. Basel III also establishes rules with respect to bank liquidity. Those rules include complex criteria establishing (i) a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) the primary purpose of which is to ensure that banks maintain adequate unencumbered, high quality liquid assets to meet their liquidity needs for 30 days under a severe liquidity stress scenario; and (ii) a net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the primary purpose of which is to promote more medium and long-term funding of assets and activities, using a one-year time horizon. Although Basel III is described as a final text, it is subject to the resolution of certain issues and to further guidance and modification, as well as to adoption by United States banking regulators, including decisions as to whether and to what extent it will apply to United States banks that are not large, internationally active banks. The foregoing description of Basel III does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of Basel III itself. FDIC Deposit Insurance The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions in order to safeguard the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC insures customer deposits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the maximum deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000 and extended unlimited deposit insurance coverage to non-interest bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2012. The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution. The amount of each DIF members assessment is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the DIF annually at between 1.15% and 1.50% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate 17 Table of Contents schedule on a semi-annual basis. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio (the ratio of the net worth of the DIF to estimated insured deposits) from 1.15% of estimated deposits to 1.35% of estimated deposits (or a comparable percentage of the asset-based assessment base described above). The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio when setting assessments for insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Bank. The FDIC has until September 30, 2020 to achieve the new minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged 0.0925% of insured deposits in fiscal 2011. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017. The FDIC may terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance upon a finding that the institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the banks depositors. Pursuant to California law, the termination of a California state chartered banks FDIC deposit insurance would result in the revocation of the banks charter, forcing it to cease conducting banking operations. Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Developments The Bank is subject to fair lending requirements and the evaluation of its small business operations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). That Act generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including those of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in its service area. A bank may be subject to substantial penalties and corrective measures for a violation of fair lending laws. Federal banking agencies also may take compliance with fair lending laws into account when regulating and supervising other activities of a bank or its bank holding company. A banks compliance with its CRA obligations is based on a performance-based evaluation system which determines the banks CRA ratings on the basis of its community lending and community development performance. When a bank holding company files an application for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will review the CRA assessment of each of the subsidiary banks of the applicant bank holding company, and a low CRA rating may be the basis for denying the application. USA Patriot Act of 2001 In October 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) of 2001 was enacted into law in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The USA Patriot Act was adopted to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. 18 Table of Contents Of particular relevance to banks and other federally insured depository institutions are the USA Patriot Acts sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and various related implementing regulations that:  establish due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts and foreign correspondent accounts;  prohibits US institutions from providing correspondent accounts to foreign shell banks;  establish standards for verifying customer identification at account opening;  set rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory agencies and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; Under implementing regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, banking institutions are required to incorporate a customer identification program into their written money laundering plans that includes procedures for:  verifying the identity of any person seeking to open an account, to the extent reasonable and practicable;  maintaining records of the information used to verify the persons identity; and  determining whether the person appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations. Consumer Laws The Company and the Bank are subject to a broad range of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. Those laws and regulations include:  The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, or HOEPA, which requires additional disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers designed to protect them against certain lending practices, such as practices deemed to constitute predatory lending.  Laws and regulations requiring banks to establish privacy policies which limit the disclosure of nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or the FACT Act, which requires banking institutions and financial services businesses to adopt practices and procedures designed to help deter identity theft, including developing appropriate fraud response programs, and provides consumers with greater control of their credit data.  The Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, which requires that credit terms be disclosed in a meaningful and consistent way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA which generally prohibits, in connection with any consumer or business credit transaction, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), or the fact that a borrower is receiving income from public assistance programs.  The Fair Housing Act, which regulates many lending practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.  The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA, which includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, which requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks.  The National Flood Insurance Act, or NFIA, which requires homes in flood-prone areas with mortgages from a federally regulated lender to have flood insurance.  The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, or SAFE Act, which requires mortgage loan originator employees of federally insured institutions to register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the states to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators, prior to originating residential mortgage loans. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with regulations of the FRB, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, FRB approval must be obtained 19 Table of Contents prior to any person or company acquiring control of a Federal Reserve member bank, such as the Bank, subject to exemptions for some transactions. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company (i) acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or (ii) has the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the bank, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; provided that no individual will be deemed to control a bank solely on account of being director, officer or employee of the bank. Control is presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more but less than 25% of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or if no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. Regulation W The FRB has adopted Regulation W to comprehensively implement sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W limit transactions between a bank and its affiliates and limit a banks ability to transfer to its affiliates the benefits arising from the banks access to insured deposits, the payment system and the discount window and other benefits of the Federal Reserve system. The statute and regulation impose quantitative and qualitative limits on the ability of a bank to extend credit to, or engage in certain other transactions with, an affiliate (and a non-affiliate if an affiliate benefits from the transaction). However, certain transactions that generally do not expose a bank to undue risk or abuse the safety net are exempted from coverage under Regulation W. Historically, a subsidiary of a bank was not considered an affiliate for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B, since their activities were limited to activities permissible for the bank itself. However, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act authorized financial subsidiaries that may engage in activities not permissible for a bank. These financial subsidiaries are now considered affiliates. Certain transactions between a financial subsidiary and another affiliate of a bank are also covered by sections 23A and 23B and under Regulation W. Regulatory Action by the FRB and DFI As previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 31, 2010 and filed with the SEC on August 31, 2010, the members of the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank entered into a Written Agreement (the FRB Agreement) with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB). On the same date, the Bank consented to the issuance of a Final Order by the DFI (the DFI Order). The principal purposes of the Agreement and DFI Order, which constitute formal supervisory actions by the FRB and the DFI, were to require us to adopt and implement formal plans and take certain actions, as well as to continue implementing measures that we previously adopted, to address the adverse consequences that the economic recession had on the performance of our loan portfolio and our operating results and to increase our capital to strengthen our ability to weather any further adverse conditions that might arise if the economic recovery remains weak or economic conditions deteriorate. The FRB Agreement and DFI Order contain substantially similar provisions. They required the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank to prepare and submit written plans to the FRB and the DFI that addressed the following matters: (i) strengthening board oversight of the management operations of the Bank; (ii) strengthening credit risk management practices and improving credit administration policies and procedures; (iii) improving the Banks position with respect to problem assets; (iv) maintaining adequate reserves for loan losses in accordance with applicable supervisory guidelines; (v) improving the capital position of the Bank and, in the case of the FRB Agreement, the capital position of the Company; (vi) adopting and implementing a new strategic plan; and (vii) submitting a funding contingency plan for the Bank that identified available sources of liquidity and a plan for dealing with potential adverse economic and market conditions. In addition, the FRB Agreement and the DFI Order placed restrictions on lending by the Bank to borrowers who had loans that were criticized in an joint examination of the Bank conducted by the FRB and DFI in 2010 and required the Bank to charge off or collect loans that were classified as loss in that examination (to the extent that the Bank had not already done so). The Bank is also prohibited from paying dividends to the Company without the prior approval of the DFI, and without the prior approval of the FRB the Company may not declare or pay cash dividends, repurchase any of its shares, make payments on its trust preferred securities or incur or guarantee any debt. The DFI Order also states that if the Bank were to violate or fail to comply with the Order, the Bank could be deemed to be conducting business in an unsafe manner which could subject the Bank to further regulatory enforcement action. 20 Table of Contents The Company and the Bank already have made substantial progress with respect to most of the requirements of the FRB Agreement and DFI Order and both the Board and management are committed to achieving the remaining requirements on a timely basis. Under the DFI Order, the Bank was required to achieve a ratio of adjusted tangible shareholders equity to its tangible assets to 9.0% by January 31, 2011, by raising additional capital, generating earnings or reducing the Banks tangible assets (subject to a 15% limitation on such a reduction) or a combination thereof and, upon achieving that ratio, to thereafter maintain that ratio during the Term of the Order. As previously reported, on August 26, 2011 we completed the sale of a total of $11.2 million of shares of a newly created Series B Convertible 8.4% Noncumulative Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock) to three institutional investors in a private placement. We then contributed the net proceeds from the sale of those shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the Bank to enable it to increase the ratio of its adjusted tangible shareholders equity to its tangible assets above 9% and thereby meet the capital requirement under the DFI Order. At December 31, 2012 that ratio had increased to 9.4% primarily as a result of the earnings generated by the Bank during the fourth quarter of 2011. A copy of the FRB Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1, and a copy of the DFI Order is attached as Exhibit 10.2, to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 31, 2011. The foregoing summary of the FRB Agreement and the DFI Order is qualified in its entirety by reference to those Exhibits. Employees As of December 31, 2011, we employed 346 persons on a full-time equivalent basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are good. Information Available on our Website Our Internet address is www.pmbank.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our filings made with the SEC electronically, including those on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and any amendments to those filings. Copies of these filings are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed or furnished these documents to the SEC (at www.sec.gov). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial condition or operating results in the future to differ significantly from our expected financial condition or operating results that are set forth in the forward looking statements contained in this Report. Set forth below is a summary description of many of those risks and uncertainties. The United States recently experienced a severe economic recession the effects of which continue to adversely impact the banking and financial services industry in general, and our business and financial performance, in particular, and has created substantial uncertainties and risks for our business and future financial performance. The United States recently experienced a severe economic recession. The recession created wide-ranging consequences and difficulties which continue to adversely affect the banking and financial services industry, in particular, and the economy, in general, including significant decreases in economic activity and in residential and commercial real estate prices and increases in unemployment, which led to increases in loan delinquencies and foreclosures. Those conditions and circumstances necessitated significant write-downs of the carrying values of assets by, and caused an erosion of the capital of, a large number of lending and other financial institutions. Like many other banks, due primarily to these conditions, we experienced substantial increases in non-performing loans and in loan losses in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Those loan losses required us (and many other banks) to significantly increase loan loss reserves by charges to income. In addition, as the economy contracted, loan demand decreased and net interest margins declined as the Federal Reserve Board reduced interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy, resulting in decreases in our net interest income. As a result, we incurred net losses of $12.0 million, $17.3 million and $14.0 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. 21 Table of Contents Although, according to economists, the economic recession is over, the economic recovery has been weak, real estate prices continue to decline, unemployment and real estate foreclosures remain high and consumer confidence is at an all time low. As a result, there are concerns that the economy may again fall into recession. Additionally, due to these conditions and the prospect that economic and market conditions will not soon recover, we face a number of risks that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in the future, including the following:  We could experience further increases in non-performing loans and other non-performing assets, consisting primarily of real properties acquired on foreclosure of non-performing loans, that would require us to write down the carrying values of such loans and other non-performing assets and to set aside additional reserves, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cause us to incur operating losses in the future.  Due to the continuing uncertainties about economic conditions, there is an increased risk that the judgments we might make in estimating loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and in establishing loan loss reserves will prove to be incorrect, requiring us to set aside additional reserves that would adversely affect our results of operations in 2011 and 2012.  Possible further declines in economic activity in the United States, generally, and in our markets, in particular, due to weak business and consumer spending and high unemployment, which could lead to:  reductions in loan demand and a further tightening of credit that would result in declines in interest income and a further compression of our net interest margins that would result in reductions in our net interest income; and  increases in deposit withdrawals by customers to meet their operating or living expenses or to shift cash into higher yielding financial instruments offered by competing financial services organizations, which could reduce our liquidity and, therefore, the funds we would have available for lending and could cause our interest income to decline, possibly significantly, and our costs of funds to increase, thereby adversely affecting our operating results and financial condition.  In response to the causes of the credit and foreclosure crises and the economic recession, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, which will increase the regulation of and impose new restrictions on banks and other financial institutions and could, as a result, increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to pursue business and growth opportunities.  We continue to have a substantial dollar amount of non-performing assets, consisting of non-performing loans and real properties that we have acquired by foreclosure during the three years ended December 31, 2011. A failure to meaningfully improve the quality of the loans in our loan portfolio or to sell those real properties without incurring substantial losses could result in further write down in the carrying values of those assets, which could (i) cause us to incur losses in 2012, and (ii) lead to the imposition, by federal and state bank regulators, of additional restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect our operating results and require us to raise additional capital that could dilute our existing shareholders. See   Risks and Uncertainties Posed by the FRB Agreement and DFI Order to which we and the Bank are subject below in this Item 1A.  We, as well as all other federally insured banks, may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums to replenish the FDICs deposit insurance fund, which would increase our operating expenses and, thereby, reduce our income. The recent downgrade of the U.S. governments sovereign credit rating by Standard & Poors Ratings Services, and any future rating agency action with respect to the U.S. governments sovereign credit rating, could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the current debt crisis in Europe, and the risk that certain countries may default on their sovereign debt, and the resulting impact on the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poors downgraded the United States long-term debt rating from its AAA rating to AA+. On August 8, 2011, Standard & Poors downgraded the credit ratings of certain long-term debt instruments issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other U.S. government agencies linked to long-term U.S. debt. These downgrades, any future downgrades, as well as any perceived concerns about the creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations, could impact our ability to obtain, and the pricing with respect to, funding that is collateralized by affected instruments and obtained through the secured and unsecured markets. We cannot predict how this or any further downgrades to the U.S. governments sovereign credit rating, or such concerns about the creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations, will impact economic or capital markets conditions generally. It is possible that any such impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial position. 22 Table of Contents In addition, the current crisis in Europe has created uncertainties with respect to the ability of certain European Union countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations. These uncertainties have adversely impacted and have created substantial volatility in the financial markets has had, a negative impact on global economic activity. Moreover, concerns have arisen that a failure of the European Union to satisfactorily resolve this debt crisis could lead to a global economic recession which could spread to the United States. As a result, even though neither we nor the Bank hold or have any exposure to any European sovereign debt, if not satisfactorily resolved this debt crisis could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and future results of operations. We could incur losses on the loans we make. Loan defaults and the incurrence of losses on the loans we make are an inherent risk of the banking business. That risk has been exacerbated by the significant slowdown in the housing markets and significant increases in real estate loan foreclosures in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties of California where most of our customers are based. This slowdown is attributable to declining real estate prices, excess inventories of unsold homes, high vacancy rates at commercial properties and increases in unemployment and a resulting loss of confidence about the future among businesses and consumers that have combined to adversely affect business and consumer spending. These conditions led to an increase in our non-performing assets in 2008, 2009 and 2010, which required us to record loan charge-offs and write-downs in the carrying values of real properties that we acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure and caused us to incur losses in that three year period. A further deterioration or even a continuing weakness in economic conditions could result in additional loan charge-offs and asset write-downs that would require us to increase the provisions we make for loan losses and losses on real estate owned that would have a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial condition and capital. We may be required to increase our reserve for loan losses which would adversely affect our financial performance in the future. On a quarterly basis we evaluate and conduct an analysis to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. However, this evaluation requires us to make a number of estimates and judgments regarding the financial condition of our larger borrowers, the fair value of the properties collateralizing our outstanding loans and economic trends that could affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their payment obligations to us. Based on those estimates and judgments, we make determinations, which are necessarily subjective, with respect to (i) the adequacy of our loan loss reserve to provide for write-downs in the carrying values and charge-offs of loans that may be required in the future and (ii) the need to increase that reserve by means of a charge to income (commonly referred to as the provision for loan losses). If, due to events or circumstances outside of our control or otherwise, those estimates or judgments prove to have been incorrect or the Banks regulators come to a different conclusion than us regarding the adequacy of the Banks loan loss reserve, we would have to increase the provisions we make for loan losses, which would reduce our income or could cause us to incur operating losses in the future. Risks and Uncertainties Posed by the FRB Agreement and DFI Order to which we and the Bank are subject. As previously reported and described in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 31, 2010, we entered into a written regulatory agreement (the FRB Agreement) with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB), and the Bank consented to the issuance by the DFI of a Final Order (the DFI Order), due primarily to the increases in loan losses and other non-performing assets and the net losses we incurred in 2008, 2009 and the first half of 2010. Set forth below is a description of material risks and uncertainties created for us by the FRB Agreement and DFI Order. We are subject to increased regulatory oversight which increases our costs of doing business and restricts our ability to grow our banking franchise. Under the terms of the FRB Agreement and DFI Order, we and the Bank are required to implement certain corrective and remedial measures within strict time frames and to maintain certain levels of liquidity, loan loss reserves and capital. In addition, we are required to increase management oversight of our operations and are subject to more frequent regulatory examinations. These requirements have had and in the future may have the effect of increasing our expenses and adversely affecting our operating results. The Bank is restricted from paying dividends to us and we are restricted from paying dividends to our shareholders and from making interest payments on our subordinated debt securities. Dividends from the Bank to us comprise our primary source of funds for paying dividends to our shareholders and paying interest on our junior subordinated debentures (the Junior Subordinated Debentures), which we issued in connection with sales of trust preferred securities in 2002 and 2004. Pursuant to the FRB Agreement and DFI Order, the Bank may not pay cash dividends to us without the prior approval of the FRB and DFI and we may not pay cash dividends to our shareholders or interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures without the prior approval of the FRB. As previously reported, we began to defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures in mid-2010, when we were advised by the FRB that it would not approve further interest payments 23 Table of Contents pending an improvement in our operating results and increases in the Banks capital and we cannot predict when the FRB will permit us to resume such payments. We are permitted to defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters; however, if we are not permitted by the FRB to pay the deferred interest and resume making interest payments on a current basis by the end of that five year period, then we would be in default of our obligations under the Junior Subordinated Debentures, in which event the entire $17.5 million principal amount of, and accrued but unpaid interest on, the Junior Subordinated Debentures would become immediately due and payable. Failure to satisfy the requirements of the FRB Agreement or the DFI Order could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and additional restrictions on our business. Although we succeeded in satisfying a requirement, under the DFI Order, to increase the Banks capital with the net proceeds from the sale of $11.2 million of Series B Preferred Shares in August 2011, we are required to maintain the Banks capital ratios and continue to meet other requirements under the DFI Order and the FRB Agreement. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not, the FRB and DFI could subject us and the Bank to regulatory enforcement actions, which could include the assessment of civil money penalties on us and the Bank, as well as on our directors, officers and other affiliated parties, and impose further restrictions on our business. Any such regulatory actions would increase our operating costs, restrict our ability to grow, make it more difficult for us to recruit officers and directors in the event the need to do so arises in the future, and could result in decreases in our income or cause us to incur losses in the future. Liquidity risk could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and hurt our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business, as we use cash to fund loans and investments and other interest-earning assets and deposit withdrawals that occur in the ordinary course of our business. Our principal sources of liquidity include deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, sales of loans or investment securities held for sale, repayments to the Bank of loans it makes to borrowers and sales of equity securities by us. If our ability to obtain funds from these sources becomes limited or the costs to us of those funds increases, whether due to factors that affect us specifically, including our financial performance or the imposition of regulatory restrictions on us, or due to factors that affect the financial services industry in general, including weakening economic conditions or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, then, our ability to grow our banking business would be adversely affected and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. We face intense competition from other banks and financial institutions that could hurt our business. We conduct our business operations in Southern California, where the banking business is highly competitive and is dominated by large multi-state and in-state banks with operations and offices covering wide geographic areas. We also compete with other financial service businesses, mutual fund companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive banking and financial products and services as well as products and services that we do not offer. The larger banks and many of those other financial institutions have greater financial and other resources that enable them to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability. They also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits than we do, which enable them to attract larger customers and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits. Increased competition may prevent us (i) from achieving increases, or could even result in decreases, in our loan volume or deposit balances, or (ii) from increasing interest rates on the loans we make or reducing the interest rates we pay to attract or retain deposits, either or both of which could cause a decline in our interest income or an increase in our interest expense and, therefore, lead to reductions in our net interest income and earnings. Adverse changes in economic conditions in Southern California could disproportionately harm our business. The substantial majority of our customers and the properties securing a large proportion of our loans are located in Southern California, where foreclosure rates and unemployment have remained high relative to most other regions of the country. A downturn in economic conditions or the occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, which are more common in Southern California than in other parts of the country, could harm our business by:  reducing loan demand which, in turn, would lead to reduced net interest margins and net interest income;  adversely affecting the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us, which could result in increases in loan losses and require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses, thereby adversely affecting our operating results or causing us to incur losses, as occurred in 2008, 2009 and 2010; and  causing reductions in real property values that, due to our reliance on real property to collateralize many of our loans, could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on non-performing loans through the foreclosure and sale of such real properties. 24 Table of Contents Our business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance. A substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential or spread between the interest we earn on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Due to the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, in turn, our profitability. In addition, as a general rule, loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates. Rising interest rates, generally, are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Conversely, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may decline and in falling interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may increase. Also, in a rising interest rate environment, we may need to accelerate the pace of rate increases on our deposit accounts as compared to the pace of future increases in short-term market rates. Accordingly, changes in market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality and loan origination volume. However, in the current economic environment, loan demand has been relatively weak despite the fact that interest rates are relatively low, due largely to the financial difficulties encountered by prospective borrowers as a result of the economic recession and the weakness of the hoped for economic recovery, the unwillingness of businesses and consumers to borrow due to uncertainties and a lack of confidence about future economic conditions and a tightening of loan underwriting standards by us, as well as other banks and lending institutions, in response to these conditions. As a result, it has become more difficult to predict the impact that changes in interest rates will have on interest rate spreads and on the future financial performance of banks, including our Bank, which has added to the volatility of and adversely affected the stock prices of many banking institutions, including our own. It is also not possible to predict how long these conditions will continue to affect us. Government regulations may impair our operations, restrict our growth or increase our operating costs. We are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state bank regulatory agencies. The primary objective of these agencies is to protect bank depositors and other customers and not shareholders, whose respective interests often differ. The regulatory agencies have the legal authority to impose restrictions which they believe are needed to protect depositors and customers of banking institutions, even if those restrictions would adversely affect the ability of the banking institution to expand its business or pay cash dividends, or result in increases in its costs of doing business or hinder its ability to compete with less regulated financial services companies. Additionally, due to the complex and technical nature of many of the government regulations to which banking organizations are subject, inadvertent violations of those regulations may and sometimes do occur. In such an event, we would be required to correct or implement measures to prevent a recurrence of such violations. If more serious violations were to occur, the regulatory agencies could limit our activities or growth, fine us or ultimately put us out of business in the event we were to encounter severe liquidity problems or a significant erosion of our capital below the minimum amounts required under applicable bank regulatory guidelines. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act poses uncertainties for our business and is likely to increase our costs of doing business in the future. On July 21, 2010, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. Changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act include, among others: (i) new requirements on banking, derivative and investment activities, including modified capital requirements, the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business demand accounts, and limitations on debit card interchange fees; (ii) enhanced financial institution safety and soundness regulations and increases in assessment fees and deposit insurance coverage; (iii) corporate governance and executive compensation requirements; and (iv) the establishment of new regulatory bodies, such as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the BCFP). The BCFP has been granted rulemaking authority over several federal consumer financial protection laws and, in some instances, has the authority to examine and enforce compliance by banks and other financial service organizations with these laws and regulations. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were made effective immediately; however, much of the Dodd-Frank Act is subject to further rulemaking and/or studies. As a result, we cannot fully assess the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us until final rules are adopted and implemented, which could be up to 24 months from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, or possibly even later. We expect that the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act repealing the prohibition on the payment by banks of interest on business demand deposits will result in price competition among banks for such deposits, which could increase the costs of funds to us (as well as to other banks) and result in a reduction in our net interest income in the future. However, we do not have sufficient information, as yet, to make any reliable predictions as to the impact that these provisions will have on our results of operations and financial performance in the future. See BUSINESS  Economic Conditions and Recent Legislation and Other Government Actions  The Dodd-Frank Act in Item 1 of this Report. 25 Table of Contents The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and permits state attorneys general to, in certain circumstances, enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether California state agencies will adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level or, if any are adopted, what impact they may have on us, our business or operating results. Premiums for federal deposit insurance have increased and may increase even more. The FDIC uses the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) to cover insured deposits in the event of bank failures, and maintains the DIF by assessing insurance premiums on FDIC-insured banks and depository institutions. The increase in bank failures during the three years ended December 31, 2010 caused the DIF to fall below the minimum balance required by law, forcing the FDIC to raise the insurance premiums assessed on FDIC-insured banks in order to rebuild the DIF. Depending on the frequency and severity of bank failures in the future, the FDIC may further increase premiums or assessments, which would increase our costs of business and could negatively affect our earnings and financial performance in the future. The loss of key personnel could hurt our financial performance. Our success depends to a great extent on the continued availability of our existing management and, in particular, on Raymond E. Dellerba, our President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition to their skills and experience as bankers, our executive officers provide us with extensive community ties upon which our competitive strategy is partially based. As a result, the loss of the services of any of these officers could harm our ability to implement our business strategy or our future operating results. Risks posed by our residential mortgage lending business. Our residential mortgage lending business, pursuant to which we originate and purchase residential real estate mortgage loans that qualify for resale into the secondary mortgage market, poses a number of potentially significant risks that could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Those risks include, among others: the risk that the growth of our mortgage lending business will strain our cash and management resources; the risk that managements time and efforts will be diverted from our commercial banking business, which could hurt our operating results; the risk that our mortgage lending business will not generate revenues in amounts sufficient to enable us to recover the substantial expenditures we have made to add experienced mortgage loan officers and administrators; the risk that our residential mortgage lending business will not grow sufficiently to contribute to earnings in relation to our investment; the risk that we will be unable to sell the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market at a profit due to changes in interest rates or a reduction in the flow of funds into the secondary mortgage market, whether due to a further weakening in the residential real estate market or a tightening in the availability of credit or otherwise; the risk that we will be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event that they do not conform to representations and warranties we made with respect to such loans at the time of their sale, or borrowers default on the first few mortgage loan payments; and the risks that there will be a decline in demand for residential mortgage loans or an increase in defaults by borrowers, due to increasing interest rates, an economic downturn, or declining real estate values. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our residential mortgage lending business will not hurt our earnings or cause us to incur losses in the future. There is no assurance that the sales of the Additional Series B Preferred Shares and Common Stock to the Carpenter Funds and SBAV LP will be consummated. In order to increase the Banks capital and support the future growth of our banking franchise, on August 26, 2011, we entered into (i) an Additional Series B Stock Purchase Agreement which provides for the purchase from us of $11.8 million of Series B Preferred Shares by SBAV LP and by Carpenter Community Bancfund, L.P. and Carpenter Community Bancfund-A, L.P., which are affiliated with each other (collectively, the Carpenter Funds) and (ii) a Common Stock Purchase Agreement which provides for the purchase by the Carpenter Funds of $15.5 million of shares of our common stock at a per share price equal to the greater of (i) the per share book value of our common stock, which was $6.26 as of December 31, 2011, or (ii) $5.31 per share. Consummation of those equity financings is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the receipt by the Carpenter Funds of regulatory approvals they need before they can acquire those Series B Preferred Shares and the common stock. We do not know whether those conditions will be satisfied and, therefore, there continues to be a risk that the sales of the $11.8 million of Series B Preferred Shares and the $15.5 million of common stock will not be consummated. In that event, it may become necessary for us to raise additional capital from other sources before we will be released from the restrictions of the FRB Agreement and DFI Order and to support the growth of our banking franchise. However, our ability to raise additional capital from other sources will be affected by our future financial performance and by economic and market conditions over which we do not have control. As a result, there is no assurance that, if needed, we would be able to raise additional capital in a meaningful amount from other sources on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to resume the implementation of our strategy to grow our banking franchise in the future. A key element of our business strategy has been to grow our banking franchise primarily by (i) opening new banking offices, (ii) offering new revenue generating products or services, such as the commencement, in the second quarter of 2009, of our mortgage banking operations, and (iii) adding banking professionals at our existing banking offices, with the objective of attracting additional customers including, in particular, small-to-medium size businesses, that would add to our profitability. Due to the losses we incurred during the three years ended December 31, 2010, the need to dedicate more personnel to the management and reduction of non-performing loans, and our increased focus on raising additional capital and returning the Bank to profitability, we have had to significantly curtail our growth strategy and we cannot predict how long it will be before we will able to resume the implementation of that strategy. Among other things we will need to substantially increase our capital to support the growth of our banking franchise. If the sales of the additional Series B Shares and Common Stock to the Carpenter Funds cannot be consummated and we are not able to raise substantial additional capital from other sources, we may be unable to resume the implementation of our growth strategy for a considerable period of time. 26 Table of Contents Expansion of our banking franchise might not achieve expected growth or increases in profitability and may adversely affect our future operating results. If the equity financings described in the two immediately preceding paragraphs are consummated, the implementation of our growth strategy, either through organic growth or the acquisition of other banks, will pose a number of risks for us, including:  the risk that any newly established banking offices will not generate revenues in amounts sufficient to cover the costs of those offices, which would reduce our income or cause us to incur operating losses;  the risk that any bank acquisitions we might consummate in the future will prove not to be accretive to or may reduce our earnings if we do not realize anticipated cost savings or if we incur unanticipated costs in integrating the acquired banks into our operations or a substantial number of the customers of the acquired banks move their banking business to our competitors;  the risk that such expansion efforts will divert management time and effort from our existing banking operations, which could adversely affect our future financial performance; or  the risk that the additional capital we may need to support our growth or the issuance of shares in any bank acquisitions will be dilutive to the share ownership of our existing shareholders. We rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers, and we may suffer an interruption in those systems. We rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our online banking services and data processing systems. Any failure or interruption, or breaches in security, of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, servicing and/or loan origination systems and, therefore, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, interruptions in service and security breaches could lead existing customers to terminate their banking relationships with us and could make it more difficult for us to attract new banking customers. We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties which we may acquire. Due to the continued weakness of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the California economy, including high levels of unemployment and the continuing declines in real estate values, many borrowers have been unable to meet their loan repayment obligations and, as a result, we have had to initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to and take title to an increased number of real properties that had collateralized their loans. Moreover, if the economic conditions remain weak or worsen, we may have to continue to foreclose and take title to additional real properties. As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even though we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to promote ethical conduct and protect our reputation. However, these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation. The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline, which may make it more difficult to realize a profit on your investment in our shares of common stock. The trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, our stock price has not only been volatile, but also has declined significantly during the three years ended December 31, 2010, due to the losses we incurred during that period and uncertainties about how long it will take us to achieve sustained profitability. The volatility of our stock price in the future may increase due to the recent 27 Table of Contents sales of the $11.2 million of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and, if consummated, the pending sales of the $11.8 million of additional Series B Preferred Shares and the $15.5 million of common stock to the Carpenter Funds, because the common stock into which Series B Preferred Shares are convertible and the common stock to be sold to the Carpenter Funds will be saleable in the open market. Moreover our stock price in the future could be adversely affected by other factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results or financial condition;  failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings estimates;  the restrictions, described below, on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock;  the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions on our business and operations or an inability to meet regulatory requirements such as those contained in the FRB Agreement and DFI Order;  an inability to resume our growth strategy in the near term or to successfully implement that strategy in the future;  strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;  fluctuations in the stock prices and operating results of our competitors;  general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry stocks;  proposed or newly adopted legislative or regulatory changes or developments aimed at the financial services industry;  any future proceedings or litigation that may involve or affect us; and  continuing concerns and a lack of confidence among investors that economic and market conditions will improve. We are currently restricted from paying dividends, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Dividends from the Bank will be the principal source of funds available to us to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future. However, as described above, pursuant to the FRB Agreement and DFI Order, the Bank may not pay cash dividends to us without the prior approval of the FRB and DFI and we may not pay cash dividends to our shareholders without the prior approval of the FRB. There is no assurance when those restrictions might be lifted, if at all. Additionally, we and the Bank are subject to additional restrictions which currently and in the future may prevent us from paying cash dividends on our common stock:  As described above, we began deferring interest payments on our Junior Subordinated Debentures in mid-2010. Under the terms of the indentures governing the Junior Subordinated Debentures, we are precluded from paying cash dividends on our common stock or preferred stock unless and until we have paid all of the deferred interest in full and thereafter make interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures as and when they become due.  No dividends may be declared or paid on shares of our common stock unless we first pay dividends to the holders of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock. There is no assurance if or when we will be able to pay such dividends on our preferred stock, however.  California laws also place restrictions on the ability of California corporations to pay cash dividends on preferred or common stock. Subject to certain limited exceptions, a California corporation may pay cash dividends only to the extent of (i) the amount of its retained earnings or (ii) the amount by which the fair value of the corporations assets exceeds its liabilities. Although the fair value of our assets exceeded our liabilities at December 31, 2011, due to the restrictions under the FRB Agreement and DFI Order which preclude us from paying dividends to shareholders and interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures and the Bank from paying dividends to us, as well as the dividend preference of the holders of our outstanding preferred stock, there is no assurance as to when we might be able to pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Finally, even if the regulatory and other restrictions on the payment of dividends by us and the Bank are lifted and we generate retained earnings in the future, it is our intention to retain cash to increase our capital and fund our operations and the expansion of our banking franchise. As a result, we have no intention to pay cash dividends at least for the foreseeable future on our common stock. 28 Table of Contents If the pending sales of additional preferred stock and common stock are completed, or we otherwise sell additional shares of our common stock, our shareholders could be subject to significant dilution in their share ownership and voting power. Potential Dilutive Effects of Sales of Additional Equity Securities. If we succeed in consummating the sales of additional Series B Preferred Shares and common stock to the Carpenter Funds and SBAV LP (the Equity Investors) pursuant to the definitive securities purchase agreements we entered into on August 26, 2011, those sales will dilute the percentage ownership and voting power of our existing shareholders and, depending on the prices paid by our existing shareholders for their shares of common stock, also in terms of the differences between the amounts they paid for their shares and the prices that the Equity Investors will have paid for their shares. This dilution also could have an adverse impact on the trading prices of our common stock. Moreover, subject to market conditions and other factors, we may seek to sell additional common stock or other equity securities in the future to meet capital requirements or to fund the growth of our business. The sales or issuances of additional common stock or other equity securities could also be dilutive of our existing shareholders depending largely on the prices at which, and the number of, additional shares or other equity securities we may sell or issue. At December 31, 2011, options to purchase a total of 1,153,741 shares of our common stock, at an average exercise price of $7.39 per share, were outstanding and an additional 550,814 shares were available for the grant of options or other equity incentives in the future under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The issuance of shares pursuant to any of those options or pursuant to any other equity incentives we may grant in the future may dilute our existing shareholders. Risks Associated with the Increase in Voting Power of the Equity Investors. If the sales of the Additional Series B Preferred Shares and common stock to the Equity Investors are consummated, the Carpenter Funds will own a total of approximately 28% of our voting stock and will be the largest shareholder of the Company. Further, as previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 26, 2011, concurrently with the sale of the Series B Preferred Shares, we entered into certain investor rights agreements with the Equity Investors. If the Carpenter Funds purchase the Additional Series B Preferred Shares and the shares of common stock pursuant to the Additional Series B and the Common Stock Purchase Agreements, respectively, they will become entitled to designate three individuals to serve on the respective Boards of Directors of both the Company and the Bank (subject to any required regulatory approvals). Due to the appointment of three representatives on the Board of Directors and their ownership of our voting stock, the Carpenter Funds will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring approval of our Board of Directors and matters requiring the approval of our shareholders, including the approval of mergers and acquisitions or changes in corporate control, and could have significant influence over our operations. There is no assurance that the interests of the Carpenter Funds will be consistent with the interests of our other shareholders or that the Carpenter Funds will not exercise their voting power in ways that could adversely affect our other shareholders. Moreover, this concentration of ownership also could have additional adverse consequences, including (i) discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to acquire us, which could impede or prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, and (ii) making it more difficult for us to sell additional shares at prices in excess of those paid by the selling shareholders for their shares of common stock, even if our financial performance significantly improves. Our articles of incorporation permit our Board of Directors to authorize and sell additional shares of preferred stock on terms that could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer that may be beneficial to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors has the power, under our articles of incorporation, to create and authorize the sale of one or more new series of preferred stock without having to obtain shareholder approval for such action. As a result, the Board could authorize the issuance of and issue shares of a new series of preferred stock to implement a shareholders rights plan (often referred to as a poison pill) or could sell and issue preferred shares with special voting rights or conversion rights that could deter or delay attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, and attempts of third parties to engage in proxy contests and effectuate changes in control of us. Our business may face other risks. Our business and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected in the future by other risks or developments that either are not known to us at the present time or are currently immaterial to our business. Such risks could include, but are not necessarily limited to, unexpected changes in government regulations, the commencement of litigation against us and unexpected adverse changes in local, national or global economic or market conditions. 29 Table of Contents For further discussion of risks that can affect our financial performance or financial condition, also see Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations below in this Report. Due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this Report, which speak only as of the date of this Report. We also disclaim any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements contained in this Report, except as may be required by law or by NASDAQ. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
