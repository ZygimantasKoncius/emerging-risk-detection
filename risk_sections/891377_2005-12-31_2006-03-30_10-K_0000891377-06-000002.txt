Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Ability to Rebuild Our Venture Capital and Consulting Business There is a risk that we will not be able to rebuild our venture capital and consulting business significantly over the next two to three years. Our objective is to use consulting revenues and expense reimbursements to finance the development of large telecommunications company relationships which will eventually lead to equity based transactions, with fees or direct investment opportunities for our Group. There is also the possibility of new venture funds raised in partnership with international sources of capital leading to management fees and carried interests. However, the venture capital and consulting market is highly competitive with significantly larger participants, and thus there is no assurance that we will be successful in our strategy. 4 Lack of Profitable Operations in Recent Years There is a risk that we will not be able to return to profitability after a period of operating losses in recent years. We are earning consulting revenues and investment income, and we have reduced operating costs considerably. However, operating losses in future periods will continue to erode our available capital base. Lack of Liquidity for Our Shares and ADRs The Company's ADRs are not traded on a major stock exchange. Our ADRs can be bought or sold on the OTC Bulletin Board, but liquidity is extremely limited. Our Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, but liquidity is also limited. Due to this lack of liquidity, there is a risk that our shares or ADRs cannot be sold without an adverse affect on the price. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
