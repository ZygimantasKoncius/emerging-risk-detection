D. Risk factors Risks Relating to Our Business Our limited operating history and relatively new business model in an emerging and rapidly evolving market make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our founder, Ms. Haiyan Gong, commenced our online dating business in 2003. We began charging our users message fees on our online dating platform in October 2008. Prior to this, we generated revenues primarily from charging for non-message related value-added services, such as VIP memberships, priority search rankings and from selling advertisement space on our platform. Accordingly, we have a limited relevant operating history from which to evaluate our business, financial performance and prospects. Since the change in our business model in 2008, we have derived a substantial portion of our net revenues from service fees generated from online dating services. Our online services revenue represented 83.7%, 88.2% and 85.7% of our net revenues in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. As a result, we have a short operating history under our current revenue model for you to evaluate in assessing our future prospects. We may not be able to achieve similar results or growth in future periods. Our business model may become obsolete due to development of other business models or technologies. You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as a young company in a new and rapidly evolving market. Our ability to maintain profitability primarily depends on, among other factors, the growth of the online dating industry in China, the continued acceptance of our business model by our users, our ability to generate continuing interest in our platform, our ability to provide services that meet the needs of our users and our ability to control costs and expenses. Accordingly, you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance. We may not be able to effectively assess or address the evolving risks and difficulties present in the market, which could threaten our capacity to continue operations successfully in the future. 5 Table of Contents If our efforts to attract a large number of users, convert users into paying users and retain paying users are not successful, our operating results would suffer. Our future growth depends on our ability to attract a large number of users, convert our users into paying users and retain our paying users. This depends in part on our ability to deliver a high-quality online dating experience to our users and our development and introduction of enhanced services to retain our paying users. As a result, we must invest significant resources in order to enhance our existing services and continue to introduce new services that people will use. If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify and enhance our services on a timely basis, we may lose user interest and fail to attract new and paying users. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if our services are not responsive to the needs of our users and paying users. Our selling and marketing expenses may increase and if efforts to increase traffic to our platform are not successful or cost-effective, our net revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected. We rely on a variety of different marketing efforts to attract traffic to our platforms and convert users into paying users. Our marketing activities involve considerable expenditures for online and traditional offline advertising and marketing. Our online advertising is designed to direct traffic to our platforms and includes purchased listings on various major Internet search engines in China as well as advertising on third-party websites. Purchased listings generally are displayed if searches for a particular word are performed on a search engine. Advertising on third-party websites includes purchasing advertising space and links to one of our platforms. In addition, we also advertise through wireless channels, including WAP portals, application download stores and in-app advertising. Depending on the arrangement, we pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to one of our platforms, a fee based on the volume of clicks to our platforms or a fee based on the volume of successful registrations from visitors who click through to one of our platforms. These arrangements generally are not exclusive. Our offline advertising includes advertising in conventional media such as television stations and print media. To enhance our market penetration, especially among working professionals, we also advertise in subway stations. Our selling and marketing expenses vary over time, depending upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, the cost of online advertising has recently increased substantially, and we expect those costs to continue to rise as long as the demand for online advertising remains robust. If we are not able to reduce our other operating costs, increase our paying user base or increase average revenue per user to offset such anticipated increases, our profitability may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our marketing activities may not be successful or cost-effective. Existing arrangements with third parties can be terminated or allowed to lapse upon their expiration and we may not be able to replace this traffic and the related revenues. We also may not be able to enter into new arrangements with third parties in response to industry trends, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Marketing strategies in China are evolving. This further requires us to enhance our marketing strategies and experiment with new marketing methods to keep pace with industry developments. Failure to refine our existing marketing activities or to introduce new effective marketing activities in a cost-effective manner could reduce our market share, cause our net revenues to decline and negatively impact our profitability. If one or more of our users suffers, or alleges to have suffered, physical, financial or emotional harm or our online dating services are misused by users, we may suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which in turn could adversely affect our net revenues and cause the value of our ADSs to decline. The nature of online dating is such that we cannot control the behavior of our users in their communications or physical interactions. It is possible that one or more of our users could be physically, financially, emotionally or otherwise harmed following interaction with other users. We warn our users to exercise caution in meetings they arrange following the use of our services or participation in our offline events, but if one or more of our users suffers or alleges to have suffered physical, financial, emotional or other harm following contact initiated on our online dating platforms or an online dating platform of one of our competitors, any resulting negative publicity or legal action could harm our reputation and business and may have an adverse effect on Chinas online dating industry in general, potentially leading to, among other things, increased government scrutiny and regulation. From time to time, we are subject to claims, which may include lawsuits, by users relating to incidents that have occurred after users meet each other. 6 Table of Contents Users may also be able to circumvent the controls we have in place to prevent illegal or dishonest activities and behavior on our platforms, such as seeking payment for sexual activity and other activities that are inconsistent with our business purpose. Users could also post fraudulent profiles or create false profiles on behalf of other non-consenting parties. Any such incident involving our online dating services could damage our reputation and our brand. This, in turn, could adversely affect our net revenues and could cause the value of our ADSs to decline. In addition, the affected users could initiate legal or other actions against us, which could cause us to incur significant expenses and damage our reputation. Negative press or public opinion about us, our management or users of our online dating platforms may result in harm to our brand and reputation, lead to government investigations and sanctions or have a material and adverse effect on our business. We have been the subject of allegations in media reports and Internet forums. In particular, some media reports and comments in Internet forums have alleged that users of our Jiayuan.com platform have been subjected to fraudulent and other illegal and dishonest activities carried out by other users of the platform. Some of our users have also been alleged to use our Jiayuan.com online platform to seek casual, non-serious relationships and to also seek and provide sexual and other activities that are inconsistent with our business purpose. Our Jiayuan.com platform has also been alleged to contain false profiles and erroneous user activity. While we have controls in place in an effort to limit such activities, our business and our brand and reputation may be materially and adversely affected through the dissemination of rumors, whether substantiated or not, about our business and operations in media reports, online news sites, blogs, social networking sites or other Internet forums. Negative press or any public allegation against us, our online dating platforms or our users, may materially and adversely harm our brand and our business. Such negative publicity or allegations, especially direct allegations against us, may also require us to engage in a defensive media campaign, which may result in an increase in our marketing expenses, divert our managements attention and adversely impact our results of operations. Government authorities may require us to restrict or discontinue the features and services provided by our online dating platforms. As a result, our business may suffer and our user base, revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be unable to maintain or expand our user base. We believe that the reputation and level of market awareness for our 世纪佳缘 (Shiji Jiayuan) and 佳缘 (Jiayuan) brands have contributed significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing our brand recognition and reputation depends primarily on the quality and consistency of our services, as well as the success of our marketing and promotional efforts. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our efforts to attract and expand our user base. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will continue to increase given the growing number of Internet sites and the low barriers to entry for companies to set up online dating services. To attract and retain users, and to promote and maintain our brands in response to competitive pressures, we intend to increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining distinct brand loyalty. If visitors and users to our platforms do not perceive our existing services to be of high quality, or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received, the value of our brands could be diluted, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our platforms. While we have devoted significant resources to brand promotion efforts in recent years, we cannot assure you that our ongoing marketing efforts will be successful in further promoting our brand. In addition, our brand image may be harmed by negative publicity relating to our company or platforms regardless of its veracity. If we are unable to further maintain and enhance our brand recognition and increase market awareness for our company and services, our ability to attract users may be harmed and our business prospects may be materially and adversely affected. We have not obtained the trademark registration for the 世纪佳缘 (Shiji Jiayuan) trademark and certain of our other trademarks for dating and marriage agency services. If we cannot secure rights to use these trademarks for dating and marriage agency services, we may be subject to third-party claims, including with respect to our 世纪佳缘 (Shiji Jiayuan) trademark, claims by an individual who applied to register such trademark in 2005, and may be forced to discontinue using these trademarks for dating and marriage agency services, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our brands, cause us to incur litigation costs and divert resources and management attention. We have not obtained the trademark registration of the 世纪佳缘 (Shiji Jiayuan) trademark, the Chinese character form of our Shiji Jiayuan brand, for dating and marriage agency services under Class 45 (Dating and Marriage Agency Services) of the International Classification of Goods and Services for such services. We have used this trademark since 2003 and have obtained the trademark registration for this trademark for use on a website under Class 42 (Website). We applied to the PRC Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or the PRC Trademark Office, for the registration of such trademark for dating and marriage agency services under Class 45 (Dating and Marriage Agency Services) in September 2009. In October 2010, the PRC Trademark Office rejected our trademark registration application on the basis that an individual had applied to register the 世纪佳缘 (Shiji Jiayuan) trademark under Class 45 in June 2005. After being informed by the PRC Trademark Office of its decision in October 2010, we filed an opposition to this individuals trademark registration application under Class 45 on the ground of malicious registration. We received a decision from the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board of the PRC Trademark Office in January 2013 that upheld our opposition and rejected this individuals trademark registration application. A publication of the decision was made by the PRC Trademark Office in March 2013. Following 30 days from the date of publication of the decision by the PRC Trademark Office, the individual is entitled to challenge the decision within 30 days. As of the date of this annual report, we are not aware of this individual having brought any action challenging this decision within the aforesaid period, and in such case, the decision made by the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board of the PRC Trademark Office upholding our opposition has become effective. 7 Table of Contents We are in the process of registering the 世纪佳缘 (Shiji Jiayuan) trademark for dating and marriage agency services and some of our other key trademarks in China, including trademarks used in connection with our imdali.com and qiuai.com websites. If our applications for our key trademarks are unsuccessful or a third party is able to register them, we may lose our ability to use our key trademarks and be unable to prevent others from using similar or identical trademarks. Furthermore, a lack of registration or license to legally use the trademarks may subject us to trademark infringement claims for our use of key trademarks. Losing the right to use our key trademarks for any reason or being subject to trademark infringement claims may adversely affect our ability to maintain and protect our brands, cause us to incur litigation costs and divert resources and management attention. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the performance of our business and may make it difficult for us to attract and retain users. The online dating sector in China is highly competitive. The market is characterized by the frequent introduction of new websites and services, short website life cycles, constantly evolving trends, rapid adoption of technological advancements, as well as price-sensitive users. We expect competition in the online dating business in China to continue to increase because there are no substantial barriers to setting up an online dating website. We compete directly with online dating service providers such as Baihe.com, Zhenai.com and Youyuan.com. We also compete with portals and classifieds websites that operate online dating sub-channels, such as 163.com, Ganji.com and 58.com. In addition, we face competition from Internet portals and social networking websites such as Sina.com.cn, Sohu.com, QQ.com, Renren.com and Kaixin001.com, including applications on wireless devices from QQ.com, WeChat and Momo. We also face competition and potential competition from overseas operators of online dating services and Internet companies that offer or seek to offer online dating services in China. In addition, we compete with traditional dating services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide dating services. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following: · the size and diversity of our user base; · the timing and market acceptance of our services, including the developments of and enhancements to those services relative to those offered by our competitors; · customer service and support efforts; · selling and marketing efforts; and · our brand strength in the marketplace relative to our competitors. Many of our current and potential competitors, including overseas companies that offer or seek to offer online dating services in China, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger user bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in user requirements. These competitors may engage in more extensive technological development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger user bases than we have. Our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to our services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our services. These activities could attract users away from our platforms and reduce our market share. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative and, in some cases, exclusive relationships with significant companies or competitors to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive services. For example, an overseas operator of online dating services acquired a minority stake in one of our competitors based in the PRC. To the extent these competitors or potential competitors establish exclusive relationships with major portals, search engines and Internet service providers, our ability to reach potential users may be restricted. Any of these competitors could cause us difficulty in attracting and retaining users and could jeopardize our existing relationships with portals, search engines and other web properties. 8 Table of Contents If we fail to keep pace with rapid technological change, our competitive position will suffer. We operate in a market characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, new product and service announcements, product enhancements and changing user demands. Accordingly, our performance will depend on our ability to adapt to these rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, and our ability to continually improve the speed, performance, features, ease of use and reliability of our services in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive services. There may be occasions when we may not be as responsive as our competitors in adapting our services to changing industry standards and the needs of our users. Our industry has been subject to constant innovation and competition. Historically, new features may be introduced by one competitor, and if they are perceived as attractive to users, they are often copied later by others. Over the past several years, such new feature introductions in the industry have included instant messaging, message boards, e-cards, virtual gifts, personality profiles and mobile content delivery. In addition, the number of people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop and laptop computers, including mobile telephones, tablet computers and other handheld computing devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years, and we expect this growth to continue. Such growth can affect our results of operations as our cost of revenues increases in part due to such users paying for our services through telecommunication operators. Payments through telecommunication operators result in an increase of the commissions that we pay to our WVAS partners because our WVAS partners charge a higher commission compared to online banking and online payment providers. Introducing new technologies into our systems involves numerous technical challenges, substantial amounts of capital and personnel resources and often takes many months to complete. For example, the lower resolution, functionality and memory currently associated with mobile devices may make the use of our services through such mobile devices more difficult and impair the user experience relative to access via desktop and laptop computers. We intend to continue to devote resources to the development of additional technologies and services. We may not be able to effectively integrate new technologies on a timely basis or at all, which may decrease user satisfaction with our online dating services. Such technologies, even if integrated, may not function as expected or may be unable to attract and retain a substantial number of mobile device users to our online dating services. We also may not be able to protect such technology from being used by our competitors. Our failure to keep pace with rapid technological changes could have a material and adverse effect on our business. If we were to lose the services of our founder and non-executive co-chairman of our board of directors, Ms. Haiyan Gong, our business could be disrupted and our business prospects could be adversely affected. Our founder and non-executive co-chairman of our board of directors, Ms. Haiyan Gong, has played an important role in the growth and development of our business since its inception. To date, we have relied heavily on her expertise in our business operations, relationships with our employees and business partners and reputation in the online dating industry. Although Ms. Gong resigned as our co-chief executive officer in December 2012, she continues to be involved in the formulation of our overall business strategies as a non-executive co-chairman of our board of directors and a consultant. If Ms. Gong becomes unable or unwilling to continue to be involved with our company, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement. In addition, if she joins a competitor or forms a competing business, it could severely disrupt our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although Ms. Gong has entered into a non-competition agreement with us wherein she is subject to certain non-competition restrictions during and for a period of two years after termination of her employment with us, we cannot assure you that such non-competition restrictions will be effective or enforceable under PRC law. Moreover, even if a complete separation of Ms. Gong from our company did not have any actual impact on our operations and the growth of our business, it could create the perception among investors or the marketplace that her departure may severely damage our business and operations and negatively affect investor confidence in us, which may cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. We do not maintain key-person insurance on Ms. Gong. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, or if such personnel do not work well together, our growth prospects and profitability will be harmed. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. As certain members of management left in 2012, we have recently recruited several members of our management, some of whom have limited experience in the online dating industry. As members of our management have only worked together as a team for a limited time, there are inherent risks in the management of our company with respect to decision-making, business direction, product development and strategic relationships. In the event that the members of our management team are unable to work well together or agree on operating principles, business direction or business transactions or are unable to provide cohesive leadership, our business could be harmed and one or more of those individuals may discontinue their service to our company forcing us to find a suitable replacement. The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business. Competition in our industry for personnel is intense, and we are aware that our competitors have directly targeted our employees and that there are former employees of ours currently working for our competitors. While we have entered into non-competition agreements with our executive officers and many of our non-executive employees, we cannot assure you that the non-competition restrictions in these agreements will be effective or enforceable under PRC law. We also do not maintain key-person insurance policies on our executive officers. The incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees provided by our option grants or by future arrangements, such as cash bonuses, may not be as effective as they have been in the past. If we do not succeed in attracting necessary personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively. In addition, if any of our management or employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose know-how, clients and key professionals and staff members. 9 Table of Contents We have re-priced, and may continue to re-price, our outstanding stock options granted to our directors and employees, any of which may result in increased share-based compensation expenses. In July 2012, in order to help retain key personnel under then-current market conditions, our board of directors approved the amendment of certain option awards granted under our 2007 Amended and Restated Share Incentive Plan. We cancelled and replaced the awards with awards that have a lower exercise price and fewer underlying shares. As the trading price of our ADSs fluctuates, we cannot assure you that we will not continue to reduce the exercise price of our outstanding options granted under the existing equity incentive plan or other equity incentive plans that may be adopted in the future. Should we reduce the exercise price of our outstanding options, our share-based compensation expenses may increase and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our inability to effectively manage our growth could materially and adversely affect our profitability. We have recently experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion. The growth and expansion of our business and services place a continuous significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We are required to manage multiple relationships with various strategic associates, technology licensors, users and other third parties. In the event of further growth of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our computer systems or procedures may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may not be able to manage this growth effectively. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to expand, train and manage our employee base. If we fail to do so, our management, operational and financial resources could be overstrained and adversely impacted. Our business depends on our server and network hardware and software and our ability to obtain network capacity; if our current systems safeguards are unable to prevent an interruption in the availability of our services, our reputation and brand may be adversely affected and our net revenue may be reduced. The performance of our server and networking hardware and software infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation, to our ability to attract visitors and users to our platforms, to convert users into paying users and to retain paying users. An unexpected or substantial increase in the use of our platforms could strain the capacity of our systems, which could lead to a slower response time or systems failures. We have in the past experienced delays due to hacking activities, including an incident in 2009 which caused our Jiayuan.com online dating platform to be temporarily unavailable for less than a day but resulted in no material loss to us. Any future slowdowns or systems failures could adversely affect the speed and responsiveness of our platforms and would diminish the experience for our visitors and users. We face risks related to our ability to scale up to our expected user levels while maintaining superior performance. If the usage of our platforms substantially increases, we may need to purchase additional servers and networking equipment and services to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited or the cost of which may be significant. Any systems failure that causes an interruption in service or a decrease in the responsiveness of our platforms could reduce traffic on our platforms and, if sustained or repeated, could impair our reputation and the attractiveness of our brands as well as reduce net revenue and negatively impact our operating results. Furthermore, we rely on many different hardware systems and software applications, some of which have been developed internally. If these hardware systems or software applications fail, it would adversely affect our ability to provide our services. If we are unable to protect our data from loss or electronic or magnetic corruption, or if we receive a significant unexpected increase in usage and are not able to rapidly expand our transaction-processing systems and network infrastructure without any systems interruptions, it could seriously harm our business and reputation. We have experienced occasional systems interruptions in the past, and we cannot assure you that we will not experience similar or more serious interruptions in the future. From time to time, our company and our platforms have been subject to delays and interruptions due to software viruses, or variants thereof, such as internet worms. To date, we have not experienced delays or systems interruptions that have had a material impact on our business. In addition, while we have backup systems in place, we do not have disaster recovery systems and in the event of a catastrophic failure involving our platforms, we may be unable to serve our web traffic for a significant period of time. Our business is therefore susceptible to earthquakes and other catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism. Our servers operate from two sites in close proximity to one another in Beijing and the absence of a redundant network in a different location could exacerbate this disruption. Any systems failure, including network, software or hardware failure, that causes an interruption in the delivery of our platforms and services or a decrease in responsiveness of our platforms would result in reduced visitor traffic, reduced net revenue and would adversely affect our reputation and brands. 10 Table of Contents We rely on third-party advertising service providers and their failure or unwillingness to effectively provide services to us could harm us by increasing our costs and reducing our operating margins. We rely on third-party advertising service providers, such as Baidu, that help market our services. Any failure of these third parties to provide their services could significantly harm our business. The steps we take to improve the marketing of our services will increase our cost and reduce our operating margins and may not be successful. Furthermore, any financial or other difficulties these providers face, the nature and extent of which we cannot predict, may adversely affect our business. Except for certain rights in our contracts with these third-party service providers, we exercise little or no control over them, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services that they provide. We are required to estimate a portion of our reported revenues and cost of revenues at period-end, which may require adjustments once we receive billing statements from WVAS partners, which may require subsequent adjustments to our financial statements. We do not directly bill our users that elect to pay for our online services through their telecommunication operators. Instead, we depend on wireless value-added services, or WVAS, partners, to record the sales volume, bill our users, collect payments from the Internet and telecommunication operators and remit to us our portion of the revenues. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, revenue remitted from WVAS partners accounted for approximately 20.6%, 30.0% and 33.4%, respectively, of our online revenues. Due to our past experience with the timing of receipt of the monthly statements provided by our WVAS partners, we rely on our own internal estimates for the portion of our reported revenues and cost of revenues attributable to our WVAS partners and are required to make adjustments when we actually receive the monthly billing statements from these partners if such statements are materially different from our estimates. Historically, there have been no significant differences between our estimates and our WVAS partners billing statements. To the extent that our WVAS partners require longer periods of time to send us monthly billing statements, we may not be able to make any adjustment prior to releasing our period-end results and we cannot assure you that any adjustment which we subsequently make would not be material. Furthermore, our WVAS partners collect user fees from telecommunication operators, such as China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. Our WVAS partners relationships with these telecommunication operators could in turn impact our business. Any loss or deterioration of our WVAS partners relationships with telecommunication operators may affect our ability to collect fees from our users, which would have an adverse effect on our cash flows and any write-off of receivables would affect our results of operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm the value of our ADSs. Prior to our initial public offering in May 2011, we were a private company with a short operating history and limited accounting personnel with U.S. GAAP experience and other resources with which to address our internal control and procedures over financial reporting. Accordingly, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in AU325, Communicating Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit, of the PCAOB Standard and Related Rules, as of December 31, 2010 and 2011. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness identified related to the lack of sufficient accounting personnel with knowledge to perform period-end reporting procedures under U.S. GAAP, to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. Management performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 in accordance with Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules as promulgated by the SEC and reported to our board of directors that the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 continued to exist as of December 31, 2012, as defined in PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated With An Audit of Financial Statements. We have undertaken certain additional remedial measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls to address the material weakness. As of December 31, 2013, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective after the remediation. For details on these initiatives, please see Item 15. Controls and Procedures  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. However, if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our management may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level. In addition, the process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that satisfies our reporting obligations. Our failure to discover and address any other material weaknesses or deficiencies may result in inaccuracies in our financial statements or delay in the preparation of our financial statements. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs, may be materially and adversely affected. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could also expose us to increased risk of fraud or misappropriations of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which our ADSs are listed, regulatory investigations or civil or criminal sanctions. 11 Table of Contents Future strategic alliances or acquisitions may have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. We have in the past and may in the future enter into strategic alliances with various third parties. Strategic alliances with third parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the counterparty and an increase in expenses incurred in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may have little ability to control or monitor their actions and to the extent strategic third parties suffer negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with such third parties. In addition, if we become aware of appropriate opportunities, we may acquire additional assets, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our existing business, such as our acquisition of certain assets of Beijing Juedui100 Network Technologies Ltd., or Beijing Juedui100. Future acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own would require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. In addition, acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant. In addition to possible shareholders approval, we may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from the government authorities in the PRC for the acquisitions and comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations, which could result in increased costs and delays. If we are unable to protect our Internet domain names or proprietary rights upon which our business relies or to avoid claims that we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, our profitability may be materially and adversely affected. We regard substantial elements of our platforms and the underlying technology as proprietary, and attempt to protect them by relying on copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws as well as restrictions on disclosure, transferring title and other methods. Contracts with our employees and consultants generally contain confidentiality provisions, and we generally seek to control access to and the distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. We also enter into agreements with key employees and officers, pursuant to which our key employees and officers assign to us the intellectual property rights in works generated by them as a result of their employment duties or from our resources while they are employed by us. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization, or to develop similar or superior technology independently. Copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret protection may not be effective and policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult. Any such misappropriation or development of similar or superior technology by third parties could adversely impact our profitability and our future financial results. 12 Table of Contents We believe that our platforms, services and other proprietary technologies do not infringe upon the rights of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that our business activities do not and will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us. From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to claims of alleged infringement of the copyrights, service marks and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Although such claims have not resulted in any significant litigation or had a material adverse effect on our business to date, any such claims and resultant litigation might subject us to temporary injunctive restrictions on the use of our services or brand names and could result in significant liability for damages for intellectual property infringement, require us to enter into royalty agreements, or restrict us from using infringing software, services, trademarks or technologies in the future. Even if not meritorious, such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from our day-to-day business. We currently hold various domain names relating to our brands and in the future may acquire new web domain names. The regulation of domain names in China and in foreign countries is subject to change. Governing bodies may establish additional top level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights are unclear. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our existing trademarks and other proprietary rights or those we may seek to acquire. Any such inability to protect ourselves could cause us to lose a significant portion of our users to our competitors. We may face potential liability, loss of users and damage to our reputation for any failure or alleged failure to protect the confidential information of our users. Our user database holds confidential information concerning our users. We may be unable to prevent third parties, such as hackers or criminal organizations, from stealing information provided by our users to us through our platforms. Confidential information of our users may also be misappropriated or inadvertently disclosed through employee misconduct or mistake. We may also in the future be required to disclose to government authorities certain confidential information concerning our users. In addition, many of our users pay for our services through third-party online payment services. In such transactions, maintaining complete security during the transmission of confidential information, such as personal information, is essential to maintaining consumer confidence. We have limited influence over the security measures of third-party online payment service providers. In addition, our third-party merchants may violate their confidentiality obligations and disclose information about our users. Any compromise of our security or third-party service providers security could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. If we are accused of failing to protect the confidential information of our users, we may be forced to expend significant financial and managerial resources in defending against these accusations and we may face potential liability. Any negative publicity may adversely affect our public image and reputation. In order to strengthen our security protocols to protect user information, we may from time to time introduce increasingly more complex registration and log-in procedures, requiring users to input more information which may negatively impact our user acquisition and user retention. In addition, any perception by the public that online commerce is becoming increasingly unsafe or that the privacy of user information is vulnerable to attack could inhibit the growth of online services generally, which in turn may reduce the number of our users. Our quarterly results may fluctuate because of a number of factors, including seasonality, and, as a result, investors should not rely on quarterly operating results as indicative of future results. Fluctuations in operating results or the failure of operating results to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors may negatively impact the value of our ADSs. Quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors that could affect net revenues or expenses in any particular quarter. Fluctuations in quarterly operating results could cause the value of our ADSs to decline. Investors should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance. Factors that may affect our quarterly results include: · the demand for, and acceptance of, our online dating services and enhancements to these services; · the introduction, development, timing, competitive pricing and market acceptance of our platforms and services and those of our competitors; · the magnitude and timing of marketing initiatives and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our operations; · the cost and timing of online and offline advertising and other marketing efforts; · the maintenance and development of relationships with portals, search engines, Internet service providers and other web properties and other entities capable of attracting potential and paying users to our platforms; · technical difficulties, systems failures, systems security breaches, or downtime of the Internet, in general, or of our services, in particular; · costs related to any acquisitions or dispositions of technologies or businesses; and · general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the Internet, online dating and related industries. 13 Table of Contents In addition, we experience seasonality in our businesses. We generally experience lower user traffic and acquire fewer new users for our online dating services and hold fewer offline events during winter and the major national holidays in China, such as the Chinese New Year holidays, which fall in January or February, and the National Day holidays, which fall in the beginning of October. As a result of the foregoing factors and because the online dating business is still immature, making it difficult to predict consumer demand, it is possible that in future periods results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. This could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. We have a history of net losses prior to 2009 and may experience earnings declines or losses in the future. We incurred net losses in all periods prior to 2009. We cannot assure you that we can sustain profitability or avoid net losses in the future. Although we experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, such growth rates may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future. In addition, our ability to be profitable depends on our ability to control our costs and operating expenses, which we expect will increase as we expand our business. We incurred in the past and expect to continue to incur in future periods certain share-based compensation expenses, which will reduce our net income and may result in future losses. If we fail to increase net revenues at the rate we anticipate or if our costs and operating expenses increase without a commensurate increase in our net revenues, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected. We may need additional capital to finance our growth or to compete, which may cause dilution to existing shareholders or limit our flexibility in conducting our business activities. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including for working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund expansion, whether in new vertical affinity or geographic markets, to develop newer or enhanced services, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary businesses, technologies or services. Such additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution, and to the extent we engage in debt financing, if available, we may become subject to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. If additional financing is not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund our expansion, promote our brands, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures. We have limited experience in cooperating with matchmaking agencies, and our efforts to expand our personalized matchmaking services across China through matchmaking agencies may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands and our results of operations. We began offering our personalized matchmaking services in cooperation with matchingmaking agencies under an outsourcing model in second-tier cities beginning in May 2013 and we had 24 locations offering personalized matchmaking services through such arrangements as of December 31, 2013. Under these cooperation arrangements, we sign the service contracts with the personalized matchmaking clients and the clients also pay us directly while the services are provided by matchmaking agencies under our close supervision. Prior to May 2013, we had no experience operating through such arrangements with matchmaking agencies, and we can provide no assurance that these arrangements will be successful. We expect to increase these types of arrangements to expand into less developed markets in China. The effect of such cooperation arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and depends upon a variety of factors, including the demand for our services in new local markets and our ability to successfully identify and work with appropriate matchmaking agencies. The matchmaking agencies with whom we enter into such arrangements have certain flexibility in running their operations and their employees are not our employees. To the extent that the matchmaking agencies with whom we enter into such arrangements do not provide services in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brands and customer service standards, the value of our brands could suffer. Failure to protect the value of our brands or any other harmful acts or omissions from matchmaking agencies with whom we enter into such arrangements could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation. In addition, we also substantially rely on them to gauge market demand. Furthermore, our arrangements with matchmaking agencies typically have a one-year term, and the matchmaking agencies with whom we enter into such arrangements may not be willing or able to renew their arrangements with us. If we are unable to renew such arrangements, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. We do not have insurance coverage and thus may incur substantial costs in the event of any business interruption, litigation or natural disaster. As the insurance industry in China is still in an early stage of development, insurance companies in China currently offer limited business insurance products. We do not have any business liability, loss of data or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of our resources. Potential intellectual property rights infringement claims against us may materially affect our business and results of operations. We could face claims by others that we are improperly using intellectual property owned by them or otherwise infringing upon their rights in intellectual property, including using unlicensed software. Although we take measures to ensure that we obtain licenses with respect to the intellectual property we use, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to infringement claims, including due to our failure to obtain necessary licenses. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur costs in either defending or settling any intellectual property disputes alleging infringement and the defense of these claims would be both costly and time-consuming, and could significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management and technical personnel. Furthermore, an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could cause us to pay monetary damages, seek licenses from third parties on unfavorable terms, pay ongoing royalties or be restricted by injunctions. Any of these factors could prevent or restrict us from pursuing some or all of our business and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 14 Table of Contents Our efforts to capitalize upon opportunities to expand into new services may fail and could result in a loss of capital and other valuable resources. One of our growth strategies is to expand into new services to increase our revenue base. We intend to target identifiable groups of people who share common interests and the desire to meet other individuals with similar interests, backgrounds or traits. We have also developed map-based search services and wireless applications which utilize location-based services to make it easier and more convenient for our users to find potential matches on our platforms. Our planned expansion into new services will occupy our managements time and attention and will require us to invest significant capital resources. The results of our expansion efforts into new services are unpredictable and there is no guarantee that our efforts will have a positive effect on our revenue base. We face many risks associated with our planned expansion into new services, including but not limited to the following possibilities: · competition from pre-existing competitors with significantly stronger brand recognition in the markets we enter; · our erroneous evaluations of the potential of such markets; · diversion of capital and other valuable resources away from our core business; · foregoing opportunities that are potentially more profitable; and · weakening our current brands by over expansion into too many new markets. We have a limited history of operating these new businesses, which makes predicting our future results of operations more difficult than it otherwise would be. Therefore, our past results of operations should not be taken as indicative of our future performance. Our ability to achieve satisfactory financial results in these new businesses is unproven. Risks Relating to Our Industry Our network is vulnerable to security breaches and inappropriate use by users, which could disrupt or deter future use of our services. Concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the Internet and the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the Internet and other online services generally, and online dating services like ours, in particular. To date, we have not experienced any material breach of our security systems. However, our failure to effectively prevent security breaches could significantly harm our business, reputation and results of operations and could expose us to lawsuits and sanctions by governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and by our users. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, including the personal data of our users, and cause interruptions in our operations or damage our brand and reputation. Such breach of our security measures could involve the disclosure of personal information and could expose us to a material risk of litigation, liability or governmental enforcement proceeding. We cannot assure you that our financial systems and other technology resources are completely secure from security breaches or sabotage, and we have occasionally experienced security breaches and attempts at hacking. We may be required to incur significant additional costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Any well-publicized compromise of our security or the security of any other platform could deter people from using our services or the Internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information or uploading personal information, which could have a detrimental impact on our potential user base. Computer viruses may cause delays or other service interruptions and could damage our reputation, affect our ability to provide our services and adversely affect our revenues. The inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could also expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Moreover, if a computer virus affecting our system were highly publicized, our reputation could be significantly damaged, resulting in the loss of current and future users and paying members. Interruptions, delays or capacity problems on our computer and telecommunications infrastructure may have a material and adverse effect on our revenue. Our services are dependent upon the use of the Internet and telephone and broadband communications to provide high-capacity data transmission without systems downtime. There have been instances where regional and national telecommunications outages in China have caused us, and other Internet businesses, to experience systems interruptions, including the temporary cessation of corporate use of short messaging services provided by telecommunications carriers. Any additional interruptions, delays or capacity problems experienced with telephone or broadband connections could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our customers. The temporary or permanent loss of all, or a portion, of the telecommunications system could cause disruption to our business activities and result in a loss of revenue. Additionally, the telecommunications industry in China is subject to strict regulatory control. Changes in current regulations, which could affect our telecommunications providers, could disrupt or adversely affect the profitability of our business. 15 Table of Contents In addition, if any of our current agreements with telecommunications providers were terminated, we may not be able to replace any terminated agreements with equally beneficial agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew any of our current agreements when they expire or, if we are able to do so, that such renewals will be available on acceptable terms. We also do not know whether we will be able to enter into additional agreements or that any relationships, if entered into, will be on terms favorable to us. Our business depends, in part, on the stability of the Internet, and our ability to provide services to our users may be limited by outages, interruptions and diminished capacity in the Internet. Our performance will depend, in part, on the continued stability of the Internet. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone in China with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable Internet services. Internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it if the number of Internet users continues to increase or if existing or future Internet users access the Internet more often or increase their bandwidth requirements. In addition, viruses, worms and similar programs may harm the performance of the Internet. We have no control over the third-party telecommunications, cable or other providers of access services to the Internet that our users rely upon. There have been instances where regional and national telecommunications outages have caused us to experience service interruptions during which our users could not access our services. Any additional interruptions, delays or capacity problems experienced with any points of access between the Internet and our users could adversely affect our ability to provide services reliably to our users. The temporary or permanent loss of all or a portion of our services on the Internet, the Internet infrastructure generally or our users ability to access the Internet could disrupt our business activities, harm our business reputation and result in a loss of revenue. Additionally, the Internet, electronic communications and telecommunications industries are subject to national, provincial, municipal and foreign governmental regulation. New laws and regulations governing such matters could be enacted or amendments may be made to existing regulations at any time that could adversely impact our services. Any such new laws, regulations or amendments to existing regulations could disrupt or adversely affect the profitability of our business. We may be liable as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet. We may be sued for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, invasion of privacy or personal injury, or under other legal theories, relating to information that is published or made available through our platform and the other sites linked to it. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services in the past. We also offer various messaging services, which may subject us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited messages, or spamming, lost or misdirected messages, security breaches, illegal or fraudulent use of personal information or interruptions or delays in the delivery of messages. We do not have insurance coverage of these types of claims. In addition, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims, even if we ultimately are not held liable. If any of these events occurs, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected or we could incur significant additional expense, and the market price of our ADSs may decline. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the downturn in the global or Chinese economy. The global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions since 2008. Chinas economy has also faced challenges. To the extent that there have been improvements in some areas, it is uncertain whether such recovery is sustainable. Since we derive substantially all of our net revenues from users in China, our business and prospects may be affected by economic conditions in China. A slowdown in Chinas economy may lead to a reduced amount of personal spending on online dating services, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, a slowdown in the global or Chinese economy or the recurrence of any financial disruptions may have a material and adverse impact on financings available to us. The weakness in the economy could erode investors confidence, which constitutes the basis of the equity markets. The recent turmoil in the financial markets may significantly restrict our ability to obtain financing in the capital markets or from financial institutions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Although we are uncertain about the extent to which the recent global financial and economic crisis and slowdown of the Chinese economy may impact our business in the short term and long term, there is a risk that our business, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected by the ongoing global economic downturn or the slowdown of the Chinese economy. 16 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Regulation of Our Business and to Our Structure If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our China business do not comply with restrictions on foreign investment in the online dating services industry and prohibitions on privately funded non-enterprise institutions from engaging in profit-making business operations, we could be subject to severe penalties, including discontinuation of our operations. Under the Regulations for the Administration of Foreign-invested Telecommunications Enterprises , or the FITE Regulations, foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunication services, including online dating services, is limited to 50%. In addition, foreign enterprises and wholly foreign-owned enterprises are currently not able to apply for the licenses required to operate online dating services in China. Since we are a Cayman Islands exempted company and therefore are a foreign enterprise under PRC law, neither we nor our PRC subsidiaries are eligible to hold a license to operate online dating services in China. In order to comply with the foreign ownership restrictions, we operate our online businesses in China through Shanghai Huaqianshu Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Huaqianshu, Beijing Huaqianshu Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Beijing Huaqianshu, Beijing Aizhenxin Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Beijing Aizhenxin, and Beijing Shiji Xique Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Xique, each of which is wholly owned by individual shareholders all of whom are PRC citizens. Our PRC operating companies hold the licenses and approvals that are required to operate our online businesses and Beijing Miyuan Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Beijing Miyuan, has entered into a series of contractual arrangements with our PRC operating companies and/or their respective shareholders. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we are considered the primary beneficiary of our PRC operating companies and their subsidiaries and consolidate the results of operations of our PRC operating companies and their subsidiaries in our financial statements. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see 
