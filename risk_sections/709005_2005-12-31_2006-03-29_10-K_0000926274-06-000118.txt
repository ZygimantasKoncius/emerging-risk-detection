ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS All phases of the Company's operations are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are outside of the Company's control and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect the Company's results of operations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations are discussed below. Prospective investors should carefully consider these factors before investing in the Company's securities. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: 7 Competition from larger companies. The Company competes for franchise sales with large national companies and numerous regional and local companies. Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial and other resources than the Company. The restaurant industry in general is intensely competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise sales on the basis of product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. A change in the business strategy of one or more of the Company's competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to sell additional franchises, maintain and renew existing franchises or sell its products through its franchise system. As a result of these factors, we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time or in certain markets. Dependence on growth strategy. A significant component of the Company's growth strategy is selling new franchises and assisting franchisees in opening new restaurants. The opening and success of new restaurants will depend upon various factors, including the franchisee's ability to find suitable sites, the ability to negotiate leases for the new restaurants on acceptable terms, the ability to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the ability to meet construction schedules, the ability of the franchisees to manage their anticipated expansion and to hire and train personnel, the ability of the franchisees to obtain acceptable financing and the effect of competition and general economic and business conditions including, but not limited to, food and labor costs. Many of the foregoing factors are not within the control of the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its plans with respect to the opening of new franchise units. Dependence on success of franchisees. A significant portion of the Company's earnings comes from royalties generated by its franchises. Franchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not the Company's employees. The Company provides training and support to franchisees, but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond the Company's control. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with the Company's standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. If they do not, the Company's image and reputation may suffer, and its revenues and stock price could decline. While the Company attempts to ensure that its franchisees maintain the quality of its brand and branded products, franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of the Company's intellectual property or reputation. Dependence on consumer preferences and perceptions. The restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. The Company can be substantially adversely affected by publicity resulting from food quality, illness, injury, or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. 8 Interruptions in supply or delivery of fresh food products. Dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh product also subjects the Company to the risks that shortages or interruptions in the supply caused by inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. In addition, factors such as inflation, market conditions for cheese, food, paper and labor may also adversely affect the franchisees and, as a result, adversely affect the Company's ability to add new restaurants. Dependence on a few individuals. The Company's business has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts and abilities of certain members of its management, particularly Paul Mobley, the Company's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and A. Scott Mobley, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer. The loss of either of their services could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Company subject to Indiana law with regard to purchase of the Company's stock. Certain provisions of Indiana law applicable to the Company could have the affect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. Such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares in the Company. These provisions include prohibitions against certain business combinations with persons that become "interested shareholders" (persons owning or controlling shares with voting power equal to 10% or more) unless the Company's Board of Directors approves either the business combination or the acquisition of stock before the person becomes an "interested shareholder." Company and its franchisees subject to various federal, state and local laws with regard to the operation of the businesses. The Company is subject to regulation by the FTC and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing certain specified information. Some states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise offering circular with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company would be subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchise units. Each franchise location is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a franchise location. Vendors, such as our third party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees and its vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. 9 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
