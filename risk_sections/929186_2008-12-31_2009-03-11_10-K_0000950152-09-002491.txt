ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Our Business The continuing volatility in the financial markets and the current recession could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The significant financial market volatility experienced worldwide during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 has continued in 2009 and the impact on the U.S. and foreign economies appears to be worsening. Although the U.S. and other foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets, it is unclear whether those actions will be effective. Therefore, the financial market volatility and the resulting negative economic impact could continue and it is possible that it may be prolonged. Although we continue to monitor market conditions, we cannot predict future market conditions or their impact on our stock price or investment portfolio. Depending on market conditions, we could incur future additional realized and unrealized losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These economic conditions have had an adverse impact on the availability and cost of capital resources. The severe downturn in the debt and equity markets, reflecting uncertainties associated with the mortgage crisis, worsening economic conditions, widening of credit spreads, bankruptcies and government intervention in large financial institutions, has resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in the Companys investment portfolio. Depending on future market conditions, the Company could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized losses in its investment portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and/or results of operations. In addition, the continuing financial market volatility and economic downturn could have a material adverse affect on our insureds, agents, claimants, reinsurers, vendors and competitors. Certain of the actions the U.S. Government has taken or may take in response to the financial market crisis have impacted certain property and casualty insurance carriers. The government is actively taking steps to implement additional measures to stabilize the financial markets and stimulate the economy, and it is possible that these measures could further affect the property and casualty insurance industry and its competitive landscape. Any downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of FMIC would prevent us from successfully engaging in direct insurance writing or obtaining adequate reinsurance on competitive terms, which would lead to a decrease in revenue and net income. Third party rating agencies periodically assess and rate the claims-paying ability of insurers based on criteria established by the rating agencies. The First Mercury group (FMIC, FMCC and AUIC) maintains an A− rating (the fourth highest of fifteen ratings) with a stable outlook from A.M. Best Company, Inc., or A.M. Best, a rating agency and publisher for the insurance industry. This rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities but is viewed by insurance consumers and intermediaries as a key indicator of the financial strength and quality of an insurer. FMIC currently has the lowest rating necessary to compete in our targeted markets as a direct insurance writer because an A− rating or higher is required by many insurance brokers, agents and policyholders when obtaining insurance and by many insurance companies that reinsure portions of our policies. Our A.M. Best rating is based on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include our business profile and the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries, which is adversely affected by underwriting losses, investment losses and dividends paid by them to us. Other factors include balance sheet strength (including capital adequacy and loss and loss adjustment expense reserve adequacy) and operating performance. Any downgrade of our ratings could cause our current and future brokers and agents, retail brokers and insureds to choose other, more highly rated, competitors and increase the cost or reduce the availability of reinsurance to us. Without at least an A− A.M. Best rating for FMIC, we could not competitively engage in direct 19 Table of Contents insurance writing, but instead would be heavily dependent on fronting carriers to underwrite premiums. These fronting arrangements would require us to pay significant fees, which could then cause our earnings to decline. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into fronting arrangements on acceptable terms, which would impair our ability to operate our business. Our actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. We are liable for losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies issued directly by us and under those for which we assume reinsurance obligations. As a result, if we fail to accurately assess the risk associated with the business that we insure, our loss reserves may be inadequate to cover our actual losses. In many cases, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. In addition, our policies generally do not provide limits on defense costs, which could increase our liability exposure under our policies. We establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each period. Our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were $372.7 million, $272.4 million, and $191.0 million at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, all of which are gross of ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. These reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are our estimates based upon various factors, including:  actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known;  estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency;  assessment of asserted theories of liability; and  analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors and judicial and legislative trends and actions. Most or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. For example, insurers have been held liable for large awards of punitive damages, which generally are not reserved for. In many cases, estimates are made more difficult by significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer and additional lags between the time of reporting and final settlement of claims. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate. While we set our reserves based on our assessment of the insurance risk assumed, as we have expanded into new classes of business, we do not have extensive proprietary loss data for other classes to use to develop reserves. Instead, we must rely on industry loss information, which may not reflect our actual claims results. As a result, our continued expansion into new classes may make it more difficult to ensure that our actual losses are within our loss reserves. If any of our reserves should prove to be inadequate, we will be required to increase reserves, resulting in a reduction in our net income and stockholders equity in the period in which the deficiency is identified. In addition, future loss experience substantially in excess of established reserves could also have a material adverse effect on future earnings and liquidity as well as our financial strength rating. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, we are only permitted to establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for losses that have occurred on or before the financial statement date. Case reserves and incurred but not reported, or IBNR, reserves contemplate these obligations. No contingency reserve allowances are established to account for future loss occurrences. Losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial. 20 Table of Contents We bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, and if any reinsurer fails to pay us, or fails to pay us on a timely basis, we could experience losses. Reinsurance is a practice whereby one insurer, called the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, called the ceding insurer, for all or part of the potential liability arising from one or more insurance policies issued by the ceding insurer. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the risk transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, this arrangement does not relieve us of our primary liability to our policyholders. At December 31, 2008, we had $181.2 million of reinsurance recoverables. Most of our reinsurance recoverables are from two reinsurers, which are subsidiaries of ACE Limited and Swiss Re. At December 31, 2008, the balances from ACE Limited and Swiss Re were $75.0 million and $63.6 million, respectively. Although we believe that we have high internal standards for reinsurers with whom we place reinsurance, we cannot assure you that our reinsurers will pay reinsurance claims on a timely basis or at all. We cannot predict if the current recession and financial market crisis will impact or prevent our reinsurers from being able to fulfill there obligations to us. If reinsurers are unwilling or unable to pay us amounts due under reinsurance contracts, we will incur unexpected losses and our cash flow will be adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We may not be able to obtain adequate reinsurance coverage or reinsurance on acceptable terms. We use significant amounts of reinsurance to manage our exposure to market and insurance risks and to enable us to write policies in excess of the level that our capital supports. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity, which can affect our business volume and profitability. Without adequate levels of appropriately priced reinsurance, the level of premiums we can underwrite could be materially reduced. The reinsurance market has changed dramatically over the past few years as a result of a number of factors, including inadequate pricing, poor underwriting and the significant losses incurred as a consequence of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. As a result, reinsurers have exited some lines of business, reduced available capacity and implemented provisions in their contracts designed to reduce their exposure to loss. In addition, the historical results of reinsurance programs and the availability of capital also affect the availability of reinsurance. Our reinsurance facilities generally are subject to annual renewal. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or that we will be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. In addition, we may underwrite risks that are excluded from coverage under the terms of our reinsurance agreements due to an underwriting oversight or differing interpretations of the reinsurance contracts. In these circumstances, we attempt to obtain coverage through special acceptance with our reinsurers or purchase facultative reinsurance. If we cannot obtain adequate reinsurance protection for these risks, we may be exposed to greater losses. Severe weather conditions and other catastrophes may result in an increase in the number and amount of claims experienced by our insureds. Most of our property business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including natural events such as severe hurricanes, winter weather, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms and fires, and other events such as explosions, terrorist attacks and riots. The incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. Severe weather conditions and catastrophes can cause losses in all of our property lines and generally result in an increase in the number of claims incurred as well as the amount of compensation sought by claimants because every geographic location in which we provide insurance policies is subject to the risk of severe weather conditions. In 2008, we recorded $2.9 million of pre-tax net losses related to the hurricane season. We use a model that is commonly used throughout the industry to help us ensure that we are purchasing sufficient catastrophe reinsurance limits. Currently, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to cover a potential catastrophe that is modeled to only occur once every 250 years. There can be no assurance that this modeled information will accurately predict catastrophic losses. It is possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could cause our loss and loss expense reserves to increase and our liquidity and financial condition to decline. 21 Table of Contents The failure of any of the loss limitations or exclusions we employ or changes in other claim or coverage issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. Various provisions of our policies, such as loss limitations, exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, which have been negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time, we employ a variety of endorsements to our policies in an attempt to limit exposure to known risks. As industry practices and legal, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the size or number of claims. Recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include increases in the number and size of claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business. In addition, we craft our insurance policy language to limit our exposure to expanding theories of legal liability such as those which have given rise to claims for lead paint, asbestos, mold and construction defects. Many of the policies we issue also include conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition, as well as limitations restricting the period during which a policyholder may bring a breach of contract or other claim against our company, which in many cases is shorter than the statutory limitations for such claims in the states in which we write business. It is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted which modifies or bars the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, we may not know the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts for many years after a contract is issued. The lack of long-term operating history and proprietary data on claims results for relatively new specialty classes may cause our future results to be less predictable. Since 2000, we have expanded our focus on new classes of the specialty insurance market, which we refer to as specialty classes, contract underwriting classes and FM Emerald, in addition to our long-standing business for security classes. These new classes represented 24.2% of our premiums produced in 2000 and 77.2% of our premiums produced in 2008. As a result of this expansion, we have a more limited operating and financial history available for specialty classes when compared to our data for security classes. This may adversely impact our ability to adequately price the insurance we write to reflect the risk assumed and to exclude risks that generate large or frequent claims and to establish appropriate loss reserves. Because we rely more heavily on industry data in calculating reserves for specialty classes, contract underwriting classes, and FM Emerald than we do for security classes, we may need to further adjust our reserve estimates for these classes in the future, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. Our growth may be dependent upon our successful acquisition and retention of additional underwriting expertise. Our operating results and future growth depend, in part, on the acquisition and successful retention of underwriting expertise. We rely on a small number of underwriters in the specialty classes for which we write policies. For example, we expanded our business into new classes in 2007 by hiring the FM Emerald management team and we introduced new classes by engaging with contract underwriters. In addition, we intend to continue to expand into other specialty classes through the acquisition of key underwriting personnel. While we intend to continue to search for suitable candidates to augment and supplement our underwriting expertise in existing and additional classes of specialty insurance, we may not be successful in identifying, hiring and retaining candidates. If we are successful in identifying candidates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire and retain them or, if they are hired and retained, that they will be successful in enhancing our business or generating an underwriting profit. 22 Table of Contents We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. Our future capital requirements, especially those of our insurance subsidiaries, depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses. We may need to raise additional funds to the extent that our cash flows are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, support growth and maintain our A.M. Best rating. Many factors will affect our capital needs, including our growth and profitability, our claims experience, our investment performance, and the availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments. If we have to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available or may be available only on terms, amounts or time periods that are not favorable to us. Equity financings could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and debt financings could subject us to covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business freely. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our business could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key employees. We are substantially dependent on a small number of key employees at our operating companies, in particular Richard H. Smith, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and our key underwriting employees. We believe that the experience and reputation in the insurance industry of Mr. Smith and our key underwriting employees are important factors in our ability to attract new business. Our success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on our ability to retain the services of our existing key employees and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may be unsuccessful in doing so. The loss of the services of Mr. Smith or any other key employee, or the inability to identify, hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could adversely affect the quality and profitability of our operations. Our insurance business is concentrated in relatively few specialty classes. Premiums produced for security classes represented 20.7% of our total direct and assumed written premiums in 2008. As a result, any changes in the security insurance market, such as changes in business, economic or regulatory conditions or changes in federal or state law or legal precedents, could adversely impact our ability to write insurance for this market. For example, any legal outcome or other incident could have the effect of increasing insurance claims in the security insurance market which could adversely impact our operating results. The loss of one or more of our top wholesale brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. For security classes, we generate business from traditional E&S lines insurance wholesalers and specialists that focus on security guards and detectives, alarm installation and service businesses and safety equipment installation and service businesses. These wholesalers and specialists are not under any contractual obligation to provide us business. Our top five wholesale brokers represented 39.0% of the premiums produced from security classes in 2008. For specialty classes, we generate business from traditional E&S lines insurance wholesalers who have a presence in the classes we underwrite. Our top five wholesale brokers represented 35.1% of the premiums produced from specialty classes in 2008. In our contract underwriting classes, we rely on a small number of producers to generate the insurance that we underwrite. For FM Emerald, we generate business from E&S lines insurance wholesalers. Out top five wholesale brokers represent 24.5% of premiums produced from FM Emerald. The loss of one or more of our top wholesale brokers for security classes, specialty classes or FM Emerald producers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain business. The insurance industry in general and the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we believe that they will remain so for the foreseeable future. We face competition from several companies, which include insurance companies, reinsurance companies, underwriting agencies, contract underwriters and captive insurance companies. As a result of this intense competition, prevailing conditions relating to price, coverage and capacity can change very rapidly. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and management 23 Table of Contents resources than we do and may be perceived as providing greater security to policyholders. There are low barriers to entry in the E&S lines insurance market, which is the primary market in which we operate, and competition in this market is fragmented and not dominated by one or more competitors. Competition in the E&S lines insurance industry is based on many factors, including price, policy terms and conditions, ratings by insurance agencies, overall financial strength of the insurer, services offered, reputation, agent and broker compensation and experience. We may face increased competition in the future in the insurance markets in which we operate, and any such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on us. Several E&S lines insurers and industry groups and associations currently offer alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products. These alternative products, including large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance that use captive insurance companies and risk retention groups, have been instituted to allow for better control of risk management and costs. We cannot predict how continued growth in alternative forms of risk protection will affect our future operations. Results in the insurance industry, and specifically the E&S lines insurance market, are subject to fluctuations and uncertainty which may adversely affect our ability to write policies. Historically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has fluctuated in cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity (known as a soft market) followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity (known as a hard market). Although an individual insurance companys financial performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern. Further, this cyclical market pattern can be more pronounced in the E&S lines market than in the standard insurance market due to greater flexibility in the E&S lines market to adjust rates to match market conditions. When the standard insurance market hardens, the E&S lines market hardens even more than the standard insurance market. During these hard market conditions, the standard insurance market writes less insurance and more customers must resort to the E&S lines market for insurance. As a result, the E&S lines market can grow more rapidly than the standard insurance market. Similarly, when conditions begin to soften, many customers that were previously driven into the E&S lines market may return to the standard insurance market, exacerbating the effects of rate decreases in the E&S lines market. Beginning in 2000 and accelerating in 2001, the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a hard market reflecting increasing rates, more restrictive coverage terms and more conservative risk selection. We believe that this trend continued through 2003. We believe that these trends slowed beginning in 2004 that the current insurance market has become more competitive in terms of pricing and policy terms and conditions. We are currently experiencing some downward pricing pressure. Because this cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors, we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle. These cyclical patterns have caused our revenues and net income to fluctuate and are expected to do so in the future. We are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, primarily by insurance regulators in Illinois, Minnesota, and Arkansas, the states in which our three insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled and, to a lesser degree, the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of the insurance companies or their shareholders. These insurance regulations generally are administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things, licensing, authorizations to write E&S lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, rate and form approvals, investment and underwriting limitations, affiliate transactions (which includes the review of services, tax sharing and other agreements with affiliates that can be a source of cash flow to us, other than dividends which are specifically regulated by law), dividend limitations, changes in control, solvency and a variety of other financial and non-financial aspects of our business. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could further limit our discretion to operate our business as we deem appropriate or make it more expensive to conduct our 24 Table of Contents business. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. In addition, regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses or approvals for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In instances where there is uncertainty as to the applicability of regulations, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the insurance industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. These actions could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry and changes in laws or regulations themselves or their interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. If we have insufficient risk-based capital, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely affected. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted a system to test the adequacy of statutory capital, known as risk-based capital. This system establishes the minimum amount of risk-based capital necessary for a company to support its overall business operations. It identifies property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at certain inherent risks of each insurers assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premiums. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Failure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business. If our IRIS ratios are outside the usual range, our business could be adversely affected. Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, ratios are part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. As of December 31, 2008, FMIC and FMCC each had one IRIS ratio outside the usual range. AUIC had two IRIS ratios outside the usual range. An insurance company may become subject to increased scrutiny when four or more of its IRIS ratios fall outside the range deemed usual by the NAIC. The nature of increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from IRIS ratios that are outside the usual range is subject to the judgment of the applicable state insurance department, but generally will result in accelerated review of annual and quarterly filings. Depending on the nature and severity of the underlying cause of the IRIS ratios being outside the usual range, increased regulatory scrutiny could range from increased but informal regulatory oversight to placing a company under regulatory control. FMIC has, in the past, had more than four ratios outside the usual range. If, in the future, FMIC has four or more ratios outside the usual range, we could become subject to greater scrutiny and oversight by regulatory authorities. See Insurance and Other Regulatory Matters. If we are unable to realize our investment objectives, our financial condition may be adversely affected. Our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio. The primary goals of our investment portfolio are to:  accumulate and preserve capital;  assure proper levels of liquidity;  optimize total after tax return subject to acceptable risk levels;  provide an acceptable and stable level of current income; and  approximate duration match between our investments and our liabilities. 25 Table of Contents The ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by general economic conditions that are beyond our control. General economic conditions can adversely affect the markets for interest rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in such markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the value of fixed income securities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. General economic conditions, stock market conditions and many other factors can also adversely affect the equities markets and, consequently, the value of the equity securities we own. We may not be able to realize our investment objectives, which could significantly reduce our financial position, stockholders equity and net income. Our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the Companys consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, hybrid securities, freestanding derivatives, and limited partnerships. The Company has categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability position may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the Company will determine the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. The determination of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption such as we are currently experiencing, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it has been and will likely continue to be difficult to value certain of our securities, such as Alt-A, subprime mortgage-backed, CMBS and ABS securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, more securities may fall to Level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation thereby resulting in values which may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2008, 7.0%, 91.9% and 1.1% of our available for sale securities were considered to be Level 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other than temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations. The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuers financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. For securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the Company currently uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security under severe recession scenarios. In addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks 26 Table of Contents associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, the current fair value as compared to cost or amortized cost of the security, as appropriate, the length of time the investment has been below cost or amortized cost and by how much, our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value, specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company concluded that approximately $12.1 million of unrealized losses were other than temporarily impaired. Additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities (which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed securities or other high yielding bonds) or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud government intervention or other reasons. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities may deteriorate causing these securities to incur losses. Our investment portfolio includes investment securities in the financial services sector that have experienced nonperformance or defaults recently. Further nonperformance or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the value of our investments in hybrid securities, perpetual preferred securities, or other equity securities in the financial services sector may be significantly impaired if the issuers of such securities defer the payment of optional coupons or dividends, are forced to accept government support or intervention, or grant majority equity stakes to their respective governments. Furthermore, the counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us. The Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the Companys stockholders equity other than U.S. government and U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and the Japanese government. However, if the Companys creditors are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other creditors of the Companys, the Companys credit concentration risk could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the Company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. Our directors and executive officers own a large percentage of our common stock, which allows them to effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval. Our directors and executive officers beneficially own 19.9% of our outstanding common stock (including options exercisable within 60 days) as of December 31, 2008, including 11.2% owned by Jerome Shaw, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer. Accordingly, these directors and executive officers will have substantial influence, if they act as a group, over the election of directors and the outcome of other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and could seek to arrange a sale of our company at a time or under conditions that are not favorable to our other stockholders. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, if they act as a group. This significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. 27 Table of Contents We rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could adversely affect our business. Our business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments, facilitate collections and cancellations and to share data across our organization. These systems also enable us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third party software license on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner. Risks Related to our Common Stock The price of our shares of common stock may be volatile. The trading price of shares of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The price of the shares of our common stock that will prevail in the market may be higher or lower than prices paid by investors, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause investors to lose part or all of their investment in shares of our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations include, but are not limited to, the following:  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of insurers securities;  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;  general economic conditions and trends;  losses in our insured portfolio;  sales of large blocks of shares of our common stock; or  departures of key personnel. Our results of operations and revenues may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry, which may cause the price of our shares to decline. The results of operations of companies in the insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Our profitability can be affected significantly by:  the differences between actual and expected losses that we cannot reasonably anticipate using historical loss data and other identifiable factors at the time we price our products;  volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks, or court grants of large awards for particular damages;  changes in the amount of loss reserves resulting from new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liabilities; and  fluctuations in equity markets, interest rates, credit risk and foreign currency exposure, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested assets and may impact the ultimate payout of losses. 28 Table of Contents In addition, the demand for the types of insurance we will offer can vary significantly, rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases, causing our revenues to fluctuate. These fluctuations in results of operations and revenues may cause the price of our securities to be volatile. If a substantial number of our shares of common stock become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our shares of common stock could decline. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our shares of common stock in the public market, the market price of our shares of common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell our shares of common stock could also depress our market price. The market price of our shares of common stock may drop significantly. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities. We do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock to our stockholders and any determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. We currently intend to retain any profits to provide capacity to write insurance and to accumulate reserves and surplus for the payment of claims. Our board of directors does not intend to declare cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends to our stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Consequently, it is uncertain when, if ever, we will declare dividends to our stockholders. If we do not pay dividends, investors will only obtain a return on their investment if the value of our shares of common stock appreciates. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our status as a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries affects our ability to pay dividends and make other payments. Our principal source of funds is dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends depends largely on our subsidiaries earnings and operating capital requirements and is subject to the regulatory, contractual, rating agency and other constraints of our subsidiaries, including the effect of any such dividends or distributions on the A.M. Best rating or other ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. Our three insurance subsidiaries are limited by regulation in their ability to pay dividends. For example, during 2009, FMIC, FMCC and AUIC may pay in the aggregate dividends to FMFC of up to $33.8 million without regulatory approval. In addition, the terms of our borrowing arrangements may limit our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that stockholders may favor and entrench current management. We are incorporated in Delaware. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable, including a provision that authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such voting rights, dividend rates, liquidation, redemption, conversion and other rights as our board of directors may fix and without further stockholder action. The issuance of preferred stock with voting rights could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This could frustrate a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in entrenchment of current management. Takeover attempts generally include offering stockholders a premium for their stock. Therefore, preventing a takeover attempt may cause you to lose an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline. Delaware law also prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board of directors approves the transaction. This provision may prevent changes in our management or corporate structure. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our board of directors is permitted to and may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future. 29 Table of Contents Our bylaws provide for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered three year terms. The classification of our board of directors could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. We are required to evaluate our internal control under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and could have an adverse effect on our stock price. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Each year we must prepare or update the process documentation and perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. During this process, if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the future (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
