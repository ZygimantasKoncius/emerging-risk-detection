D. Risk Factors. A financial crisis in any region worldwide can have a significant impact in the countries in which we operate, and consequently, may adversely affect our operations, as well as our liquidity. The five countries in which we operate are vulnerable to external shocks, which could cause significant economic difficulties and affect their growth. In case any of these economies experience a lower economic growth or a recession, it is likely that our customers will demand less electricity, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition adversely. Furthermore, some of our customers may experience difficulties in paying their electricity bills, and an increase in uncollectible accounts would also affect our results adversely. In addition, a financial crisis and its disruptive effect on the financial industry can have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain new bank loans under normal terms and conditions. Our ability to tap the capital markets in the five countries where we operate, as well as the international capital markets for other sources of liquidity, may also be diminished, or such financing may be available only at higher interest levels. Reduced liquidity could, in turn, affect our capital expenditures, our long-term investments and acquisitions, our growth prospects, and our dividend payout policy. A financial crisis in the European Community or a European sovereign debt crisis may have an adverse effect on our liquidity. At the time of filing this Report, the crisis in the euro zone is threatening a recession in Europe and defaults by certain governments. There is also a risk of a run on deposits of banks short of cash, a significant increase in the yields of European governments bonds, a corporate credit crunch, tighter fiscal policies, and a significant decrease in investor confidence in the euro zone. Among the countries that are particularly at risk are Spain and Italy, home of our parent companies, Endesa Spain and Enel, respectively. We carry out a significant portion of our bank financings and derivative hedges with European banks. Our European counterparty risk takes into account loans and derivatives accounted for either in the parent bank entities headquartered in Europe or in any of their subsidiaries or agencies outside Europe. In general terms, European banks who act through their foreign subsidiaries, agencies and representative offices also take an aggregated group risk to counterparty exposure, both theirs and ours. If any of the European banks with which we have significant relationships were to encounter severe financial difficulties, our access to bank loans would be significantly curtailed, and would probably lead to an increase in our interest expense. As of December 31, 2011, $ 410 million of our outstanding bank debt and $ 546 million of the notional amount of our derivative hedges are with bank groups whose parent companies are headquartered in Europe. The derivative hedges deal with both currency swaps and interest rates swaps, though the most significant component is the currency hedge for the dollar against the inflation-indexed Chilean peso (the UF). As of December 31, 2011, these derivative hedges had a mark to market value of $ 3.9 million in our favor. Of the amounts mentioned here, 91% of our bank debt and 91% of the notional amount of our derivatives have been contracted with Spanish banks. A severe financial disruption affecting these Spanish banks could therefore have an adverse effect on us. (See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. ̶̶̶ ̶̶̶ B. Liquidity & Capital Resources and Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.) South American economic fluctuations are likely to affect our results from operations and financial condition, as well as the value of our securities. All of our operations are located in five South American countries. Accordingly, our consolidated revenues are sensitive to the performance of South American economies as a whole. If local, regional or worldwide economic trends adversely affect the economy of any of the five countries in which we have investments or operations, our financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, we have investments in relatively risky countries such as Argentina. Generation and distribution of cash from subsidiaries located in Argentina have been lower than expected. A substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in Chile, making our financial condition and results of operations particularly dependent on the performance of Chile. In 2011, Chilean GDP increased by 6.2% compared to a 5.2% increase in 2010. The latest estimate from the Chilean Central Bank forecasts growth for 2012, in the 3.75%-4.75% range. However, such growth may not be achieved and the growth trend may not be sustainable in the future. Future developments in the Chilean economy may impair our ability to proceed with our strategic plans and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the South American financial and securities markets are, to varying degrees, influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investor reaction to developments in one 15 Table of Contents country may have a significant contagion effect on the securities of issuers in other countries, including Chile. Chilean financial and securities markets may be adversely affected by events in other countries and such effects may affect the value of our securities. Certain South American economies have been characterized by frequent and occasionally drastic intervention by governmental authorities, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Governmental authorities have changed monetary, credit, tariff, tax and other policies to influence the course of the economies of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. To a lesser extent, the Chilean government has also exercised and continues to exercise a substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector, which may result in changes to economic or other policies. These governmental actions, intended to control inflation and affect other policies, have often involved wage, price and tariff rate controls as well as other interventionist measures. For example, Argentina froze bank accounts and imposed capital restrictions in 2001, nationalized the private sector pension funds in 2008, used Central Bank reserves of the Argentine Treasury in order to pay down indebtedness maturing in 2010, and according to a survey by Torcuato di Tella University, the government has intervened the national statistics office since 2007 in order to underreport inflation. In 2010, Colombia imposed an equity tax to finance the works to repair damages caused by severe flooding, which resulted in an accrual booked in January 2011 for tax payable in 2011-2014. For additional information please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  A. Operating Results  2. Country by Country Comparative Analysis of Operating and Non-Operating Results for 2010 and 2011  Selling and Administrative Expenses). Changes in the policies of these governmental authorities with respect to tariff rates, exchange controls, regulations and taxation could adversely affect our business and financial results, reducing our profitability, as could inflation, devaluation, social instability and other political, economic or diplomatic developments, including the response by governments in the region to these circumstances. Our electricity business is subject to risks arising from natural disasters, catastrophic accidents and acts of terrorism, which could adversely affect our operations, earnings and cash flow. Our primary facilities include power plants and their associated transmission lines, pipelines, LNG terminals and re-gasification plants, storage and chartered LNG tankers. Our facilities may be damaged by earthquakes, flooding, fires, other catastrophic disasters arising from natural or accidental human causes, as well as acts of terrorism. We could experience severe business disruptions, significant decreases in revenues based on lower demand arising from catastrophic events, or significant additional costs to us not otherwise covered by business interruption insurance clauses. There may be an important time lag between a major accident or catastrophic event and the final reimbursement from our insurance policies, which typically carry non-recoverable deductible amounts, and in any event are subject to caps per event. For further detail, please see Item 4 D. Property, Plants and Equipment. As an example, on February 27, 2010, Chile experienced a major earthquake, with a magnitude of 8.8 on the Richter scale, in the Bío-Bío Region, followed by a tsunami. Our thermal generation plants Bocamina and Bocamina II, which are located near the epicenter, sustained damages as a result of the earthquake. A material breach of penal law by our senior management or employees may lead to very adverse consequences. In each of the countries where we operate, our senior management or employees could become involved in fraudulent practices such as intentional manipulation of financial statements, misappropriation of assets, inappropriate traffic of influence, insider trading, bribery, kickbacks, receipt of gratuities, unauthorized intercompany transactions, deliberate release of misleading information or rumors, and other forms of corruption or breach of penal law. Depending on the materiality of such fraudulent acts, we could be exposed to regulatory fines, litigation, loss of operating licenses or concessions, and even insolvency or bankruptcy. For further discussion, please see Item 6 Directors, Senior Management and Employees  c. Board Practices and Item 16.B Code of Ethics. We are subject to financing risks, such as those associated with funding our new projects and capital expenditures, risks related to refinancing our maturing debt, and to debt covenant compliance, all of which could adversely affect our liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, the principal amount of our outstanding debt in financial terms was $ 3,769 million while, for accounting purposes, it totaled $ 3,904 million. These amounts differ since financial debt, unlike accounting debt, does not include accrued interest. 16 Table of Contents Our financial debt had the following maturity timetable: · $ 450 million in 2012; · $ 534 million in 2013; · $ 866 million in the 2014-2016 period; and · $ 1,919 million thereafter. Set forth below is a breakdown by country for financial debt maturing in 2012: · $ 104 million  Chile; · $ 129 million  Argentina; · $ 157 million  Colombia; and · $ 60 million  Peru. Some of our debt agreements are subject to financial covenants. They also contain affirmative and negative covenants, events of default or mandatory prepayments for contractual breaches, including certain changes of control, and for material mergers and divestments, among other provisions. A significant portion of our financial indebtedness is subject to cross default provisions, with different definitions, criteria, materiality thresholds, and applicability as to the subsidiaries that could give rise to such a cross default. In the event that we or our subsidiaries breach any of these material contractual provisions, our creditors and bond holders may demand immediate repayment, and a significant portion of our indebtedness could become due and payable. We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us. In the absence of such refinancing, we could be forced to dispose of assets in order to make up for any shortfall in the payments due on our indebtedness under circumstances that might not be favorable to obtaining the best price for such assets. Furthermore, assets may not be sold quickly enough, or for amounts sufficient to enable us to make such payments. We may also be unable to raise funds required to finish our projects under development or under construction. Market conditions prevailing at the moment we require these funds or other unforeseen project costs can compromise our ability to finance these projects and expenditures. As of the date of this Report, Argentina continues to be the country with the highest refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2011, the third-party financial debt of our Argentine subsidiaries amounted to $ 297 million. As a matter of policy for all of our Argentine subsidiaries as long as fundamental issues concerning the electricity sector remain unresolved, we intend to roll over our outstanding Argentine debt to the extent we are able to do so. If our creditors do not continue to accept rolling over debt when it becomes due, and we are unable to refinance such obligations, we may default on such indebtedness. Our Argentine subsidiary, Endesa Costanera, did not make an installment payment due on March 30, 2012 of $ 17.6 million (which includes $ 4.3 million in interest expense) under the terms of a supplier credit agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) originally entered into in 1996. The aggregate amount accrued under the supplier credit agreement as of March 30, 2012, including capitalized interest, was $ 141 million. Endesa Costanera has experienced difficulties in making timely payments under its agreement with MC on a recurring basis since the Argentine crisis of 2002, but has in the past received waivers expressing the willingness to renegotiate payments. Such missed payments have been carried out on mutually agreed terms. As of the date of this Report, Endesa Costanera has not received a waiver for the payment past due. The relevant terms of the supplier credit provide for a 180-day grace period for payment. There can be no assurance that Endesa Costanera will receive a waiver or payment extension prior to the expiration of the 180-day grace period for payment. (See 
