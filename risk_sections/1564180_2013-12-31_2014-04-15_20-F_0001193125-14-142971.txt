D. Risk Factors Some of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and to our business in general. Other risks relate principally to the securities market and to ownership of our common units. The occurrence of any of the events described in this section could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash available for distributions or the trading price of our common units. Risks Inherent in Our Business We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our common units and subordinated units. We may not have sufficient cash from operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit on our common units and subordinated units. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the risks described in this section, including, among other things:  the rates we obtain from our charters;  the price and level of production of, and demand for, crude oil;  the level of our operating costs, such as the cost of crews and insurance;  the number of off-hire days for our fleet and the timing of, and number of days required for, drydocking of vessels;  the supply of shuttle tankers;  prevailing global and regional economic and political conditions;  changes in local income tax rates; 4 Table of Contents  currency exchange rate fluctuations; and  the effect of governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards on the conduct of our business. In addition, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution depends on other factors, including:  the level of capital expenditures we make, including for maintaining or replacing vessels, building new vessels, acquiring existing vessels and complying with regulations;  our debt service requirements, including fluctuations in interest rates, and restrictions on distributions contained in our debt instruments;  the level of debt we will incur if we exercise our option to purchase the Hilda Knutsen, the Torill Knutsen, the Ingrid Knutsen or the Raquel Knutsen from KNOT;  fluctuations in our working capital needs;  our ability to make, and the level of, working capital borrowings; and  the amount of any cash reserves, including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working capital and other matters, established by our board of directors. The amount of cash we generate from our operations may differ materially from our profit or loss for the period, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result of this and the other factors mentioned above, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net income. Our ability to grow and to meet our financial needs may be adversely affected by our cash distribution policy. Our cash distribution policy, which is consistent with our partnership agreement, requires us to distribute all of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement) each quarter. Accordingly, our growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. In determining the amount of cash available for distribution, our board of directors approves the amount of cash reserves to set aside, including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working capital and other matters. We also rely upon external financing sources, including commercial borrowings, to fund our capital expenditures. Accordingly, to the extent we do not have sufficient cash reserves or are unable to obtain financing, our cash distribution policy may significantly impair our ability to meet our financial needs or to grow. We must make substantial capital expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet, which reduces cash available for distribution. In addition, each quarter we are required to deduct estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus, which may result in less cash available to unitholders than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted. We must make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and replace, over the long-term, the operating capacity of our fleet. Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures include capital expenditures associated with the removal of a vessel from the water for inspection, maintenance and/or repair of submerged parts (or drydocking) and modifying an existing vessel or acquiring a new vessel to the extent these expenditures are incurred to maintain or replace the operating capacity of our fleet. These expenditures could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could increase as a result of changes in:  the cost of labor and materials;  customer requirements;  the size of our fleet; 5 Table of Contents  the cost of replacement vessels;  length of charters;  governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards relating to safety, security or the environment; and  competitive standards. Our partnership agreement requires our board of directors to deduct estimated, rather than actual, maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus each quarter in an effort to reduce fluctuations in operating surplus (as defined in our partnership agreement). The amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by our conflicts committee at least once a year. In years when estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are higher than actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders will be lower than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted from operating surplus. If our board of directors underestimates the appropriate level of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, we may have less cash available for distribution in future periods when actual capital expenditures exceed our previous estimates. If capital expenditures are financed through cash from operations or by issuing debt or equity securities, our ability to make cash distributions may be diminished, our financial leverage could increase or our unitholders may be diluted. Use of cash from operations to expand or maintain our fleet reduces cash available for distribution to unitholders. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering as well as by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds for future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Even if we are successful in obtaining necessary funds, the terms of such financings could limit our ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional equity securities may result in significant unitholder dilution and would increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain our current level of quarterly distributions to unitholders, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make cash distributions. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing, pursuing other business opportunities and paying distributions to our unitholders. As of December 31, 2013, we had consolidated debt of approximately $350 million. We have the ability to incur additional debt. Please read Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:  our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;  we will need a substantial portion of our cash flows to make principal and interest payments on our debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders;  our debt level may make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our industry or the economy generally;  our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; and 6 Table of Contents  if we are unable to satisfy the restrictions included in any of our financing agreements or are otherwise in default under any of those agreements, as a result of our debt levels or otherwise, we will not be able to make cash distributions to our unitholders, notwithstanding our stated cash distribution policy. Our ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all. Financing agreements containing operating and financial restrictions may restrict our business and financing activities. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our financing agreements and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities. For example, the financing agreements may restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to:  incur or guarantee indebtedness;  change ownership or structure, including mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions;  make dividends or distributions;  make certain negative pledges and grant certain liens;  sell, transfer, assign or convey assets;  make certain investments; and  enter into a new line of business. In addition, our financing agreements require us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests, including, among others, maintaining a minimum liquidity, maintaining positive working capital, ensuring that EBITDA exceeds interest payable, any amounts payable for interest rate swap contracts and debt installments calculated on a four quarter rolling average basis, maintaining a minimum collateral value, and maintaining a minimum book equity ratio. Our ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants, including financial ratios and tests, contained in our financing agreements is dependent on future performance and may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or in current or future debt financing agreements, there could be a default under the terms of those agreements. In addition, if KNOT does not fulfill its obligations pursuant to the omnibus agreement to guarantee the payments of the hire rate under the time charter for the Windsor Knutsen, this could result in an event of default under the $85 million senior secured loan facility secured by the Windsor Knutsen. If a default occurs under these agreements, lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. We have pledged our vessels as security for our outstanding indebtedness. If our lenders were to foreclose on our vessels in the event of a default, this may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. If any of these events occur, we cannot guarantee that our assets will be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable. Any of these events would adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders and cause a decline in the market price of our common units. Please read Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsLiquidity and Capital Resources. 7 Table of Contents Restrictions in our debt agreements may prevent us or our subsidiaries from paying distributions. The payment of principal and interest on our debt reduces cash available for distribution to us and on our units. In addition, our and our subsidiaries financing agreements prohibit the payment of distributions upon the occurrence of the following events, among others:  failure to pay any principal, interest, fees, expenses or other amounts when due;  failure to notify the lenders of any material oil spill or discharge of hazardous material, or of any action or claim related thereto;  breach or lapse of any insurance with respect to vessels securing the facilities;  breach of certain financial covenants;  failure to observe any other agreement, security instrument, obligation or covenant beyond specified cure periods in certain cases;  default under other indebtedness;  bankruptcy or insolvency events;  failure of any representation or warranty to be correct;  a change of ownership, as defined in the applicable agreement; and  a material adverse change, as defined in the applicable agreement. For more information regarding our financing agreements, please read Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsLiquidity and Capital Resources. The failure to consummate or integrate acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions that expand our fleet are an important component of our strategy. For example, we have an option to purchase any of the Hilda Knutsen, the Torill Knutsen, the Ingrid Knutsen and the Raquel Knutsen from KNOT if we are able to reach an agreement with KNOT regarding its purchase price. Pursuant to the omnibus agreement, we have the right to purchase the Hilda Knutsen, the Torill Knutsen, the Ingrid Knutsen and the Raquel Knutsen at any time within 24 months after KNOT notifies our board of directors of their respective acceptances by their charterers. We are not obligated to purchase any of these vessels at the applicable determined price, and, accordingly, we may not complete the purchase of any of such vessels. Furthermore, even if we are able to agree on a price with KNOT, there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain adequate financing on terms that are acceptable to us. We believe that other acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time, and any such acquisition could be significant. Any acquisition of a vessel or business may not be profitable at or after the time of acquisition and may not generate cash flows sufficient to justify the investment. In addition, our acquisition growth strategy exposes us to risks that may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders, including risks that we may:  fail to realize anticipated benefits, such as new customer relationships, cost-savings or cash flow enhancements;  be unable to attract, hire, train or retain qualified shore and seafaring personnel to manage and operate our growing business and fleet;  decrease our liquidity by using a significant portion of available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions; 8 Table of Contents  significantly increase our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;  incur or assume unanticipated liabilities, losses or costs associated with the business or vessels acquired; or  incur other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges. In addition, unlike newbuilds, existing vessels typically do not carry warranties as to their condition. While we generally inspect existing vessels prior to purchase, such an inspection would normally not provide us with as much knowledge of a vessels condition as we would possess if it had been built for us and operated by us during its life. Repairs and maintenance costs for existing vessels are difficult to predict and may be substantially higher than for vessels we have operated since they were built. These costs could decrease our cash flows and reduce our liquidity. Certain acquisition and investment opportunities may not result in the consummation of a transaction. In addition, we may not be able to obtain acceptable terms for the required financing for any such acquisition or investment that arises. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our common units. Our future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired vessels or businesses or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring vessels or businesses, the risk of failing to successfully and timely integrate the operations or management of any acquired vessels or businesses and the risk of diverting managements attention from existing operations or other priorities. We may also be subject to additional costs related to compliance with various international laws in connection with such acquisition. If we fail to consummate and integrate our acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution could be adversely affected. Our charters are subject to early termination under certain circumstances and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution to unitholders. Our fleet consists of five shuttle tankers. If any of our vessels are unable to generate revenues as a result of the expiration or termination of its charter or sustained periods of off-hire time, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Each of our charters terminates automatically if the applicable vessel is lost or missing or damage to the vessel results in a constructive total loss. The customer, under certain circumstances, may also have an option to terminate a time charter if the vessel is requisitioned by any government for a period of time in excess of the time period specified in the time charter or if at any time we are in default under the time charter. In addition, either party may terminate a charter in the event of the outbreak of war between specified countries. Under our bareboat charters, the charter is deemed terminated as of the date of any compulsory acquisition of the vessel or requisition for title by any governmental or other competent authority. For more information regarding the termination of our charters, please read Item 4. Information on the PartnershipBusiness OverviewCharters. We may experience operational problems with vessels that reduce revenue and increase costs. Shuttle tankers are complex and their operation technically challenging. Marine transportation operations are subject to mechanical risks and problems. Operational problems may lead to loss of revenue or higher than anticipated operating expenses or require additional capital expenditures. Any of these results could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. We derive all of our revenues from four customers, and the loss of any such customers could result in a significant loss of revenues and cash flow. We derive all of our time charter and bareboat revenues from four customers. For the year ended December 31, 2013, BG Group, Transpetro, Statoil and Repsol accounted for approximately 28%, 31%, 29% and 12%, respectively, of our revenues. If we lose a key customer, we may be unable to obtain replacement long-term charters and may become subject to the volatile spot market, which is highly competitive and subject to significant price fluctuations. In addition, if a customer exercises its right to terminate a charter, we may be unable to re-charter such vessel on terms as favorable to us as those of the terminated charter. 9 Table of Contents The loss of any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. We depend on subsidiaries of KNOT to assist us in operating our businesses and competing in our markets. We and our operating subsidiaries entered into various services agreements with certain subsidiaries of KNOT, including KNOT Management, pursuant to which such subsidiaries provide us with certain administrative, financial and other services and to our operating subsidiaries substantially all of their crew, technical and commercial management services (including vessel maintenance, periodic drydocking, cleaning and painting, performing work required by regulations and human resources and financial services) and other advisory and technical services, including the sourcing of new contracts and renewals of existing contracts. Our operational success and ability to execute our growth strategy depends significantly upon the satisfactory performance of these services by the KNOT subsidiaries. Our business will be harmed if such subsidiaries fail to perform these services satisfactorily or if they stop providing these services to us or our operating subsidiaries. Our ability to compete to enter into new charters and expand our customer relationships depends largely on our ability to leverage our relationship with KNOT and its reputation and relationships in the shipping industry. If KNOT suffers material damage to its reputation or relationships, it may harm the ability of us or our subsidiaries to:  renew existing charters upon their expiration;  obtain new charters;  successfully interact with shipyards;  obtain financing on commercially acceptable terms; or  maintain satisfactory relationships with suppliers and other third parties. If our ability to do any of the things described above is impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Our growth depends on continued growth in demand for offshore oil transportation services. Our growth strategy focuses on expansion in the shuttle tanker sector. Accordingly, our growth depends on continued growth in the demand for offshore oil transportation services. Factors beyond our control that affect the offshore oil transportation industry may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. In the past, the market for offshore oil transportation services and the prices charged for shipping the products that shuttle tankers carry have been cyclical. Fluctuations in the hire rate we can charge our customers result from changes in the supply of carrying capacity and demand for the crude oil carried. The factors affecting supply and demand for shuttle tankers and supply and demand for crude oil transported by shuttle tankers are outside of our control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable. The factors that influence the demand for shuttle tanker capacity include:  changes in the actual or projected price of oil, which could impact the exploration for or development of new offshore oil fields or the production of oil at certain fields we service;  levels of demand for and production of oil, which, among other things, is affected by competition from alternative sources of energy, other factors making consumption of oil more or less attractive or energy conservation measures; 10 Table of Contents  changes in the production of oil in areas linked by pipelines to consuming areas, the extension of existing, or the development of new, pipeline systems in markets we may serve, or the conversion of existing non-oil pipelines to oil pipelines in those markets;  changes in laws and regulations affecting the shuttle tanker industry;  global and regional economic and political conditions, particularly in oil-consuming regions, as well as environmental concerns and regulations, which could impact the supply of oil and gas as well as the demand for various types of vessels; and  changes in trading patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported. The factors that influence the supply of shuttle tanker capacity include:  the number of deliveries of new vessels under construction or on order;  the scrapping rate of older vessels;  oil and gas company policy with respect to technical vessel requirements; and  the number of vessels that are off-hire. Reduced demand for shuttle tanker services or an increase in the supply of shuttle tanker capacity would have a material adverse effect on our future growth and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial position. We depend on our customers willingness and ability to fund operating and capital expenditures to provide crude oil shuttle tankers for new or expanding offshore projects. Future adverse economic conditions may lead to a decline in our customers operations or ability to pay for our services, which could result in decreased demand for our vessels. There has historically been a strong link between the development of the world economy and demand for energy, including oil and natural gas. The world economy is continuing to face a number of challenges. As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the EFSF), and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the EFSM), to provide funding to Eurozone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the ESM), which will be activated by mutual agreement, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Eurozone countries after June 2013. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations and the overall stability of the euro. An extended period of adverse development in the outlook for European countries could reduce the overall demand for oil and have a negative impact on our customers. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could affect our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Moreover, any global financial or credit crisis or disruption may reduce the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. Shortage of liquidity and credit combined with uncertainty in worldwide equity markets could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession. Such deterioration of the worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas, exploration and production activity and transportation of oil and natural gas that could lead to a decrease in the hire rate earned by our vessels and a decrease in new charter activity. In addition, any adverse development in the global financial markets or deterioration in economic conditions might adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity at prices that will not be dilutive to our existing unitholders or preclude us from issuing equity at all. We also cannot be certain that additional financing will be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to expand our existing business, complete shuttle tanker acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. 11 Table of Contents Furthermore, any uncertainty in the financial markets could have an impact on our customers and/or suppliers including, among other things, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. Similarly, any shortage of credit could affect lenders participating in our financing agreements, making them unable to fulfill their commitments and obligations to us. Any reductions in activity owing to such conditions or failure by our customers, suppliers or lenders to meet their contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operation and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Our growth depends on our ability to expand relationships with existing customers and obtain new customers, for which we face substantial competition. One of our principal objectives is to enter into additional long-term, fixed-rate charters. The process of obtaining new long-term charters is highly competitive, most often involves an intensive screening process and competitive bids and often extends for several months. Shuttle tanker charters are awarded based upon a variety of factors relating to the vessel operator, including:  industry relationships and reputation for customer service and safety;  experience and quality of ship operations;  quality, experience and technical capability of the crew;  relationships with shipyards and the ability to get suitable berths;  construction management experience, including the ability to obtain on-time delivery of new vessels according to customer specifications;  willingness to accept operational risks pursuant to the charter, among other things such as allowing termination of the charter for force majeure events; and  competitiveness of the bid in terms of overall price. Our ability to win new charters depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:  leverage our relationship with KNOT and its reputation and relationships in the shipping industry;  successfully manage our liquidity and obtain the necessary financing to fund our growth;  attract, hire, train and retain qualified personnel and ship management companies to manage and operate our fleet;  identify and consummate desirable acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; and  identify and capitalize on opportunities in new markets. We expect substantial competition for providing services for potential shuttle tanker projects from a number of experienced companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than do we or KNOT. This increased competition may cause greater price competition for charters. As a result of these factors, we may be unable to expand our relationships with existing customers or to obtain new customers on a profitable basis, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. 12 Table of Contents An increase in the global supply of shuttle tanker capacity without a commensurate increase in demand may have an adverse effect on hire rates and the values of our vessels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. The supply of shuttle tankers in the industry is affected by, among other things, assessments of the demand for these vessels by oil companies. Any over-estimation of demand for vessels may result in an excess supply of new shuttle tankers. This may, in the long term when existing contracts expire, result in lower hire rates and depress the values of our vessels. In such an event, our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. During periods of high utilization and high hire rates, industry participants may increase the supply of shuttle tankers by ordering the construction of new vessels. This may result in an over-supply of shuttle tankers and may cause a subsequent decline in utilization and hire rates when the vessels enter the market. Lower utilization and hire rates could adversely affect revenues and profitability. Prolonged periods of low utilization and hire rate could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on shuttle tankers if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these shuttle tankers may not be recoverable. Such impairment charge may cause lenders to accelerate loan payments under our financing agreements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. The required drydocking of our vessels could be more expensive and time consuming than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our cash available for distribution to unitholders. We must periodically drydock each of our vessels for inspection, repairs and maintenance and any modifications required to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. Generally, we drydock each vessel every 60 months until the vessel is 15 years old, after which drydocking takes place every 30 months. The required drydocking of our vessels could be more expensive and time consuming than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our cash available for distribution. The drydocking of our vessels requires significant capital expenditures and results in loss of revenue while our vessels are off-hire. Any significant increase in the number of days of off-hire due to such drydocking or in the costs of any repairs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders. Although we do not anticipate that more than one of our vessels will be out of service at any given time, we may underestimate the time required to drydock any of our vessels or unanticipated problems may arise. If more than one of our vessels is required to be out of service at the same time, if a vessel is drydocked longer than expected or if the cost of repairs during drydocking is greater than budgeted, our cash available for distribution to unitholders could be adversely affected. We may be unable to re-charter our vessels upon termination or expiration of their existing charters. We are dependent upon charters for our vessels to generate revenues and we may be adversely affected if we fail to renew or are unsuccessful in winning new charters, or if our existing charters are terminated. Our ability to re-charter our shuttle tankers following expiration of existing charters and the rates payable upon any renewal or replacement charters depends upon, among other things, the state of the shuttle tanker market. For example, an oversupply of shuttle tankers can significantly reduce their charter rates. A termination or renegotiation of our existing charters or a failure to secure new employment at the expiration of our current charters may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Delays in deliveries of newbuilds could harm our operating results. The delivery of any newbuilds we may order could be delayed, which would delay our receipt of revenues under the charters or other contracts related to the vessels. In addition, under some charters we may enter into that are related to a newbuild, if our delivery of the newbuild to our customer is delayed, we may be required to pay liquidated damages during the delay. For prolonged delays, the customer may terminate the charter and, in addition to the resulting loss of revenues, we may be responsible for additional, substantial liquidated damages. The completion and delivery of newbuilds could be delayed because of:  quality or engineering problems; 13 Table of Contents  changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organization standards;  work stoppages or other labor disturbances at the shipyard;  bankruptcy or other financial crisis of the shipbuilder;  a backlog of orders at the shipyard;  political or economic disturbances;  weather interference or a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake or fire;  requests for changes to the original vessel specifications;  shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials, such as steel;  inability to finance the construction or conversion of the vessels; or  inability to obtain requisite permits or approvals. If delivery of a vessel is materially delayed, it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Compliance with safety and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be very costly and may adversely affect our business. The hull and machinery of every large, oceangoing commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The Fortaleza Knutsen, the Recife Knutsen, the Windsor Knutsen, the Bodil Knutsen and the Carmen Knutsen are certified by Det Norske Veritas ASA. As part of the certification process, a vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessels machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Each of the vessels in our existing fleet is on a planned maintenance system approval, and as such the classification society attends onboard once every year to verify that the maintenance of the equipment onboard is done correctly. Each of the vessels in our existing fleet is required to be qualified within its respective classification society for drydocking once every five years subject to an intermediate underwater survey done using an approved diving company in the presence of a surveyor from the classification society. If any vessel does not maintain its class or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey or special survey, the vessel will be unable to trade between certain ports and will be unemployable. We would lose revenue while the vessel was off-hire and incur costs of compliance. This would negatively impact our revenues and reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders. Over time, the value of our vessels may decline, which could adversely affect our operating results. Vessel values for shuttle tankers can fluctuate substantially over time due to a number of different factors, including:  prevailing economic conditions in oil and energy markets;  a substantial or extended decline in demand for oil;  increases in the supply of vessel capacity; 14 Table of Contents  the cost of retrofitting or modifying existing vessels, as a result of technological advances in vessel design or equipment, changes in applicable environmental or other regulations or standards, or otherwise; and  a decrease in oil reserves in the fields and other fields in which our shuttle tankers might otherwise be deployed. If operation of a vessel is not profitable, or if we cannot redeploy a vessel at attractive rates upon termination of its charter, rather than continue to incur costs to maintain and finance the vessel, we may seek to dispose of it. Our inability to dispose of the vessel at a reasonable value could result in a loss on its sale and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Further, if we determine at any time that a vessels future useful life and earnings require us to impair its value on our financial statements, we may need to recognize a significant charge against our earnings. Additionally, lenders may accelerate loan repayments should there be a loss in the market value of our vessels. Such repayment could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely impact our operations and markets. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries and the International Maritime Organization (the IMO) have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vessels. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and obligations relating to climate change could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our vessels and require us to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities may also be adversely affected. Adverse effects upon the oil industry relating to climate change, including growing public concern about the environmental impact of climate change, may also adversely affect demand for our shuttle tanker services. Although we do not expect that demand for oil will lessen dramatically over the short term, in the long term climate change may reduce the demand for oil or increased regulation of greenhouse gases may create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on our business that we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Our international operations expose us to political, governmental and economic instability, which could harm our operations. Because our operations are conducted in various countries, they may be affected by economic, political and governmental conditions in the countries where we engage in business or where our vessels are registered. Any disruption caused by these factors could harm our business, including by reducing the levels of oil exploration, development and production activities in these areas. We may derive some of our revenues from shipping oil from politically unstable regions. Conflicts in these regions have included attacks on ships and other efforts to disrupt shipping. Hostilities or other political instability in regions where we operate or where we may operate could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. In addition, tariffs, trade embargoes and other economic sanctions by the United States or other countries against countries in Southeast Asia or elsewhere as a result of terrorist attacks, hostilities or otherwise may limit trading activities with those countries, which could also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Finally, a government could requisition one or more of our vessels, which is most likely during war or national emergency. Any such requisition would cause a loss of the vessel and/or a termination of the charter and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. 15 Table of Contents Marine transportation is inherently risky, particularly in the extreme conditions in which our vessels operate. An incident involving significant loss of product or environmental contamination by any of our vessels could harm our reputation and business. Vessels and their cargoes and the oil production facilities we service are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as:  marine disasters;  bad weather;  mechanical failures;  grounding, capsizing, fire, explosions and collisions;  piracy;  human error; and  war and terrorism. The Bodil Knutsen currently operates in the North Sea. Harsh weather conditions in this region and other regions in which our vessels operate may increase the risk of collisions, oil spills or mechanical failures. An accident involving any of our vessels could result in any of the following:  death or injury to persons, loss of property or damage to the environment and natural resources;  delays in the delivery of cargo;  loss of revenues from charters;  liabilities or costs to recover any spilled oil or other petroleum products and to restore the ecosystem affected by the spill;  governmental fines, penalties or restrictions on conducting business;  higher insurance rates; and  damage to our reputation and customer relationships generally. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. In addition, any damage to, or environmental contamination involving, oil production facilities serviced could suspend that service and result in loss of revenues. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses that may occur to our property or as a result of our operations. The operation of shuttle tankers is inherently risky. All risks may not be adequately insured against, and any particular claim may not be paid by insurance. Any claims relating to our operations covered by insurance would be subject to deductibles, and since it is possible that a large number of claims may be brought, the aggregate amount of these deductibles could be material. Certain insurance is maintained through mutual protection and indemnity associations (P&I clubs), and as a member of such associations we may be required to make additional payments over and above budgeted premiums if member claims exceed association reserves. The agreed deductible on each vessel averages $150,000 for the shuttle tankers in our fleet. We may be unable to procure adequate insurance at commercially reasonable rates in the future. For example, more stringent environmental regulations have led in the past to increased costs for, and in the future may result in 16 Table of Contents the lack of availability of, insurance against risks of environmental damage or pollution. A catastrophic oil spill or marine disaster could exceed the insurance, and any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. In addition, the insurance may be voidable by the insurers as a result of certain actions, such as vessels failing to maintain certification with applicable maritime self-regulatory organizations. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may also make certain types of insurance more difficult to obtain. In addition, the insurance that may be available may be significantly more expensive than existing coverage. Terrorist attacks, piracy, increased hostilities or war could lead to further economic instability, increased costs and disruption of business. Terrorist attacks, piracy and the current conflicts in the Middle East, and other current and future conflicts, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to raise capital and future growth. Continuing hostilities in the Middle East may lead to additional armed conflicts or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the United States or elsewhere, which may contribute further to economic instability and disruption of oil production and distribution, which could result in reduced demand for our services. In addition, oil production facilities, shipyards, vessels, pipelines, oil fields or other infrastructure could be targets of future terrorist attacks and our vessels could be targets of pirates or hijackers. Any such attacks could lead to, among other things, bodily injury or loss of life, vessel or other property damage, increased vessel operational costs, including insurance costs, and the inability to transport oil to or from certain locations. Terrorist attacks, war, piracy, hijacking or other events beyond our control that adversely affect the distribution, production or transportation of oil to be shipped by us could entitle customers to terminate their charters, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have recently increased in frequency, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Acts of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. In recent years, the frequency and severity of piracy incidents has significantly increased, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. If such piracy attacks result in regions in which our vessels are deployed being named on the Joint War Committee Listed Areas, war-risk insurance premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage might become more difficult to obtain. In addition, crew costs, including costs that may be incurred to the extent we employ onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost or unavailability of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. The offshore oil transportation industry is subject to substantial environmental and other regulations, which may significantly limit operations or increase expenses. Our operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties and conventions in force in international waters and the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which our vessels operate, as well as the countries of our vessels registration, including those governing oil spills, discharges to air and water and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and other pollution. In addition, we believe that the heightened environmental, quality and security concerns of insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers will generally lead to additional regulatory requirements, including enhanced risk assessment and security requirements and greater inspection and safety requirements on vessels. These requirements are likely to add incremental costs to our operations and the failure to comply with these requirements may affect the ability of our vessels to obtain the required certificates for entry into the different ports where we operate and could also impact our ability to obtain insurance. We expect to incur substantial expenses in complying with these laws and regulations, including expenses for vessel modifications and changes in operating procedures. 17 Table of Contents These requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of our vessels, require a reduction in cargo capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports or detention in certain ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, we could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, natural resource damage claims and fines and penalties in the event that there is a release of petroleum or hazardous substances from our vessels or otherwise in connection with our operations. We could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of petroleum or hazardous substances associated with our operations. In addition, oil spills and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations, including, in certain instances, seizure or detention of our vessels. Please read Item 4. Information on the PartnershipBusiness OverviewEnvironmental and Other Regulation. Exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results in fluctuations in cash flows and operating results. Our reporting currency and the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. Our operating subsidiaries are party to certain technical management agreements with KNOT Management, which govern the crew, technical and commercial management of the vessels in our fleet. Under the amended technical management agreements, KNOT Management is paid for reasonable direct and indirect expenses incurred in providing the services, including operating expenses relating to our fleet. A majority of the operating expenses are in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuating exchange rates may result in increased payments by us under the services agreements if the strength of the U.S. Dollar declines relative to such other currencies. Many seafaring employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and the failure to renew those agreements or any future labor agreements may disrupt operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. A significant portion of seafarers that crew certain of our vessels and primarily Norwegian-based onshore operational staff that provide services to us are employed under collective bargaining agreements. We and our operating subsidiaries may become subject to additional labor agreements in the future. We and our operating subsidiaries may suffer labor disruptions if relationships deteriorate with the seafarers or the unions that represent them. The collective bargaining agreements may not prevent labor disruptions, particularly when the agreements are being renegotiated. Salaries are typically renegotiated annually or bi-annually for seafarers and annually for onshore operational staff, and higher compensation levels will increase our costs of operations. Although these negotiations have not caused labor disruptions in the past, any future labor disruptions could harm our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. KNOT may on our behalf be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees or crew necessary to operate our business or may have to pay substantially increased costs for its employees and crew. Our success depends in large part on KNOTs ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. In crewing our vessels, we require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically demanding work. Competition to attract, hire, train and retain qualified crew members is intense, and crew manning costs continue to increase. If we are not able to increase our hire rates to compensate for any crew cost increases, our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. Any inability we experience in the future to attract, hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business. Maritime claimants could arrest our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow. If we are in default on some kinds of obligations, such as those to our lenders, crew members, suppliers of goods and services to our vessels or shippers of cargo, these parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against one or 18 Table of Contents more of our vessels. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. In a few jurisdictions, claimants could try to assert sister ship liability against one vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another of our vessels. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flows and require us to pay to have the arrest lifted. Under some of our present charters, if the vessel is arrested or detained as a result of a claim against us, we may be in default of our charter and the charterer may terminate the charter. This would negatively impact our revenues and reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders. Lack of diversification and adverse developments in the shuttle tanker market or the conventional oil tanker market would negatively impact our results. Although our vessels also are able to operate as conventional oil tankers, we are focused on dynamic positioning shuttle tankers. Due to our lack of diversification, any adverse development in this market and/or the conventional oil tanker market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us KNOT and its affiliates may compete with us. Pursuant to the omnibus agreement, KNOT and its controlled affiliates (other than us, our general partner and our subsidiaries) generally have agreed not to acquire, own, operate or charter certain shuttle tankers operating under charters of five years or more. The omnibus agreement, however, contains significant exceptions that may allow KNOT or any of its controlled affiliates to compete with us, which could harm our business. Please read Item 7. Major Unitholders and Related Party TransactionsRelated Party TransactionsOmnibus AgreementNoncompetition. Unitholders have limited voting rights, and our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of Norwegian Resident Holders and unitholders owning more than 4.9% of our common units. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of common units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. We hold a meeting of the limited partners every year to elect one or more members of our board of directors and to vote on any other matters that are properly brought before the meeting. Common unitholders are entitled to elect only four of the seven members of our board of directors. The elected directors are elected on a staggered basis and serve for four-year terms. Our general partner in its sole discretion appoints the remaining three directors and sets the terms for which those directors serve. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management. Unitholders have no right to elect our general partner, and our general partner may not be removed except by a vote of the holders of at least 66 2⁄3% of the outstanding common and subordinated units, including any units owned by our general partner and its affiliates, voting together as a single class. Our partnership agreement further restricts unitholders voting rights by providing that Norwegian Resident Holders are not eligible to vote in the election of elected directors. Further, if any person or group owns beneficially more than 4.9% of any class of units then outstanding, any such units owned by that person or group in excess of 4.9% may not be voted on any matter and are not considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes (except for purposes of nominating a person for election to our board of directors), determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes, unless required by law. The voting rights of any unitholders not entitled to vote on a specific matter are effectively redistributed pro rata among the other common unitholders. Our general partner, its affiliates and persons who acquire common units with the prior approval of our board of directors are not subject to the 4.9% limitation except with respect to voting their common units in the election of the elected directors. 19 Table of Contents KNOT and its affiliates own a 51% interest in us, of which 2.0% is owned by our general partner, and have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary and contractual duties to us and our common unitholders, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of our unitholders. As of December 31, 2013, KNOT owned a 49% limited partner interest in us and owns and controls our general partner, which has a 2.0% general partner interest in us. Certain of our directors are directors of KNOT or its affiliates, and, as such, they have fiduciary duties to KNOT or its affiliates that may cause them to pursue business strategies that disproportionately benefit KNOT or its affiliates or which otherwise are not in the best interests of us or our unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between KNOT and its affiliates (including our general partner), on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of our unitholders. Please read Our partnership agreement limits our general partners and our directors fiduciary duties to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner or our directors. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:  neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our general partner or KNOT or its affiliates to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets, and KNOTs officers and directors have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the shareholders of KNOT, which may be contrary to our interests;  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner. Specifically, our general partner is considered to be acting in its individual capacity if it exercises its call right, pre-emptive rights or registration rights, consents or withholds consent to any merger or consolidation of the Partnership, appoints any directors or votes for the election of any director, votes or refrains from voting on amendments to our partnership agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units, voluntarily withdraws from the Partnership, transfers (to the extent permitted under our partnership agreement) or refrains from transferring its units or general partner interest or votes upon the dissolution of the Partnership;  our general partner and our directors have limited their liabilities and reduced their fiduciary duties under the laws of the Marshall Islands, while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders, and, as a result of purchasing common units, unitholders are treated as having agreed to the modified standard of fiduciary duties and to certain actions that may be taken by our general partner and our directors, all as set forth in our partnership agreement;  our general partner is entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred by it and its affiliates for our benefit;  our partnership agreement does not restrict us from paying our general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered to us on terms that are fair and reasonable or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;  our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase our common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80.0% of our common units; and  our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the exercise of its limited call right. Although a majority of our directors will over time be elected by common unitholders, our general partner will likely have substantial influence on decisions made by our board of directors. Please read Item 7. Major Unitholders and Related Party Transactions. Our partnership agreement limits our general partners and our directors fiduciary duties to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner or our directors. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner irrevocably delegates to our board of directors the authority to oversee and direct our operations, management and policies on an exclusive basis, and such delegation 20 Table of Contents is binding on any successor general partner of the Partnership. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner and directors would otherwise be held by Marshall Islands law. For example, our partnership agreement:  permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner. Where our partnership agreement permits, our general partner may consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and in such cases it has no fiduciary duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting us, our affiliates or our unitholders. Decisions made by our general partner in its individual capacity are made by its board of directors, which is appointed by KNOT. Specifically, pursuant to our partnership agreement, our general partner is considered to be acting in its individual capacity if it exercises its call right, pre-emptive rights or registration rights, consents or withholds consent to any merger or consolidation of the Partnership, appoints any directors or votes for the election of any director, votes or refrains from voting on amendments to our partnership agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units, voluntarily withdraws from the Partnership, transfers (to the extent permitted under our partnership agreement) or refrains from transferring its units or general partner interest or votes upon the dissolution of the Partnership;  provides that our general partner and our directors are entitled to make other decisions in good faith if they reasonably believe that the decision is in our best interests;  generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of our board of directors and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be fair and reasonable to us and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable, our board of directors may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and  provides that neither our general partner nor our officers or our directors is liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or our officers or directors or those other persons engaged in actual fraud or willful misconduct. In order to become a limited partner of our partnership, a common unitholder is required to agree to be bound by the provisions in our partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner delegates all its management activities in relation to us to our board of directors, and arrangements are in place such that any activities that would otherwise constitute regulated activities under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities Order) 2001 were they to be performed in the United Kingdom (and that would not fall within a suitable exemption) are performed outside of the United Kingdom. However, there can be no assurance that this will not change (deliberately or otherwise) over time, and there is no current intention for our general partner, us or any of our subsidiaries to seek authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, which would be required for any person to lawfully carry out such regulated activities in the United Kingdom. Fees and cost reimbursements, which KNOT Management determines for services provided to us and our subsidiaries, are substantial, payable regardless of our profitability and reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Pursuant to the amended technical management agreements, our subsidiaries pay fees for services provided to them by KNOT Management and reimburse KNOT Management for all expenses incurred on their behalf. These fees and expenses include all costs and expenses incurred in providing the crew, technical and commercial management of the vessels in our fleet to our subsidiaries. In addition, our operating subsidiaries pay KNOT Management a management fee equal to 5% of its costs and expenses incurred in connection with providing these services to our operating subsidiaries. In addition, pursuant to an administrative services agreement, KNOT UK provides us with certain administrative services. KNOT UK is permitted to subcontract certain of the administrative services provided to us 21 Table of Contents under this agreement to KOAS UK and KOAS. From time to time, certain services that are within the scope of services that KOAS would otherwise perform for us have been performed by KNOT Management on the same terms and conditions. We reimburse KNOT UK, and KNOT UK reimburses KOAS UK, KOAS and KNOT Management, as applicable, for their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of the services subcontracted to KOAS UK and KOAS under the administrative services agreement. In addition, KNOT UK pays to KOAS UK and KOAS, as applicable, a service fee in U.S. Dollars equal to 5% of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with providing services. For a description of the amended technical management agreements and the administrative services agreement, please read Item 7. Major Unitholders and Related Party Transactions. The fees and expenses payable pursuant to the amended technical management agreements and the administrative services agreement are payable without regard to our business, results of operation and financial condition. The payment of fees to and the reimbursement of expenses of KNOT Management and certain other affiliates of KNOT could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group from attempting to remove our current management or our general partner, and even if public unitholders are dissatisfied, they are unable to remove our general partner without KNOTs consent, unless KNOTs ownership interest in us is decreased, all of which could diminish the trading price of our common units. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group from attempting to remove our current management or our general partner.  Our unitholders are unable to remove our general partner without its consent, because our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2⁄3% of all outstanding common and subordinated units voting together as a single class is required to remove the general partner. As of December 31, 2013, KNOT owned none of the outstanding common units and all of the subordinated units.  If our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by our general partner and KNOT are not voted in favor of that removal, all remaining subordinated units automatically convert into common units, any existing arrearages on the common units are extinguished, and our general partner has the right to convert its general partner interest, and the holders of the incentive distribution rights have the right to convert such incentive distribution rights, into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests based on the fair market value of those interests at the time. A removal of our general partner under these circumstances would adversely affect the common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation preference over the subordinated units, which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests. Any conversion of the general partner interest or incentive distribution rights would be dilutive to existing unitholders. Furthermore, any cash payment in lieu of such conversion could be prohibitively expensive. Cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor business decisions, such as charges of poor management of our business by the directors appointed by our general partner, so the removal of our general partner because of our unitholders dissatisfaction with the general partners decisions in this regard would most likely result in the termination of the subordination period.  Common unitholders are entitled to elect only four of the seven members of our board of directors. Our general partner in its sole discretion appoints the remaining three directors.  Election of the four directors elected by common unitholders is staggered, meaning that the members of only one of four classes of our elected directors are selected each year. In addition, the directors appointed by our general partner serve for terms determined by our general partner.  Our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings of unitholders, to nominate directors and to acquire information about our operations as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management. 22 Table of Contents  Unitholders voting rights are further restricted by our partnership agreement provision providing that if any person or group owns beneficially more than 4.9% of any class of units then outstanding, any such units owned by that person or group in excess of 4.9% may not be voted on any matter and are not considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes (except for purposes of nominating a person for election to our board of directors), determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes, unless required by law. The voting rights of any such unitholders in excess of 4.9% effectively are redistributed pro rata among the other common unitholders holding less than 4.9% of the voting power of all classes of units entitled to vote. Our general partner, its affiliates and persons who acquire common units with the prior approval of our board of directors are not subject to this 4.9% limitation except with respect to voting their common units in the election of the elected directors.  There are no restrictions in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue equity securities. The effect of these provisions may be to diminish the price at which the common units trade. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. In addition, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of our general partner from transferring their respective membership interests in our general partner to a third party. Substantial future sales of our common units in the public market could cause the price of our common units to fall. We have granted registration rights to KNOT and certain of its affiliates. These unitholders have the right, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering any of our common, subordinated or other equity securities owned by them or to include those securities in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other unitholders. As of December 31, 2013, KNOT owned none of the common units, all of the subordinated units and all of the incentive distribution rights. Following their registration and sale under an applicable registration statement, those securities will become freely tradable. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of common units or other securities, these unitholders could cause the price of our common units to decline. KNOT, as the holder of all of the incentive distribution rights, may elect to cause us to issue additional common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to its incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of our board of directors or holders of our common units and subordinated units. This may result in lower distributions to holders of our common units in certain situations. KNOT, as the holder of all of the incentive distribution rights, has the right, at a time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (48.0%) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial cash target distribution levels at higher levels based on the distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by KNOT, the minimum quarterly distribution will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution per common unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the reset minimum quarterly distribution), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on the same percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution. In connection with resetting these target distribution levels, KNOT will be entitled to receive a number of common units equal to that number of common units whose aggregate quarterly cash distributions equaled the average of the distributions to it on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters. We anticipate that KNOT would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion; however, it is possible that KNOT could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or may be expected to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be 23 Table of Contents issued our common units, rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued additional common units to KNOT in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to KNOTs incentive distribution rights. Please read Item 8. Financial InformationConsolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationIncentive Distribution Rights. We may issue additional equity securities, including securities senior to the common units, without the approval of our unitholders, which would dilute their ownership interests. We may, without the approval of our unitholders, issue an unlimited number of additional units or other equity securities. In addition, we may issue an unlimited number of units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:  our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;  because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and  the market price of the common units may decline. Upon the expiration of the subordination period, the subordinated units will convert into common units and will then participate pro rata with other common units in distributions of available cash. During the subordination period, the common units will have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit, plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters, before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units. Distribution arrearages do not accrue on the subordinated units. The purpose of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash from operating surplus to be distributed on the common units. Upon the expiration of the subordination period, the subordinated units will convert into common units and will then participate pro rata with other common units in distributions of available cash. Please read Item 8. Financial InformationConsolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationSubordination Period. In establishing cash reserves, our board of directors may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement requires our board of directors to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it determines are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures. These reserves also affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our board of directors may establish reserves for distributions on the subordinated units, but only if those reserves will not prevent us from distributing the full minimum quarterly distribution, plus any arrearages, on the common units for the following four quarters. As described above in Risks Inherent in Our BusinessWe must make substantial capital expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet, which reduces cash available for distribution. In addition, each quarter we are required to deduct estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus, which may result in less cash available to unitholders than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted, our partnership agreement requires our board of directors each quarter to deduct from operating surplus estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, as opposed to actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, which could reduce the amount of available cash for distribution. The amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by our board of directors at least once a year, provided that any change must be approved by the conflicts committee of our board of directors. 24 Table of Contents Our general partner has a limited call right that may require our unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price. If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80.0% of the common units, our general partner has the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than the then-current market price of our common units. Our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the exercise of this limited call right. As a result, our unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Our unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. As of December 31, 2013, KNOT, which owns and controls our general partner, owned none of our common units. At the end of the subordination period, assuming no additional issuances of common units and the conversion of our subordinated units into common units, KNOT will own 50% of our common units. Our unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business. As a limited partner in a partnership organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if our unitholders participate in the control of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of the Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. In addition, the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some jurisdictions in which we do business. We can borrow money to pay distributions, which would reduce the amount of credit available to operate our business. Our partnership agreement allows us to make working capital borrowings to pay distributions. Accordingly, if we have available borrowing capacity, we can make distributions on all our units even though cash generated by our operations may not be sufficient to pay such distributions. Any working capital borrowings by us to make distributions reduces the amount of working capital borrowings we can make for operating our business. For more information, please read Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Increases in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline. An increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general, and in particular for yield-based equity investments such as our common units. Any such increase in interest rates or reduction in demand for our common units resulting from other relatively more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions. Under some circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under the Marshall Islands Limited Partnership Act (the Marshall Islands Act), we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities, other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of ours, to exceed the fair value of our assets, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited will be included in our assets only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability. Marshall Islands law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Marshall Islands law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. 25 Table of Contents Assignees who become substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the limited partnership that are known to the assignee at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from our partnership agreement. We have limited history operating as a separate publicly traded entity and incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded limited partnership. Our IPO closed on April 15, 2013. As a newly public limited liability company, we are required to comply with the SECs reporting requirements and with corporate governance and related requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE). We incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in complying with these and other applicable regulations. We have incurred incremental general and administrative expenses as a publicly traded limited partnership, including costs associated with annual reports to unitholders, tax return preparation, investor relations, registrar and transfer agents fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and officer and director compensation. We are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies make our common units less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal control over financial reporting and an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to our auditors report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and our financial statements. We cannot predict if investors find our common units less attractive, because we are relying on these exemptions. If some investors find our common units less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common units, and our unit price may be more volatile. In addition, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an emerging growth company. For as long as we take advantage of the reduced reporting obligations, the information that we provide unitholders may be different than information provided by other public companies. We have been organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of partnership law. Our partnership affairs are governed by our partnership agreement and by the Marshall Islands Act. The provisions of the Marshall Islands Act resemble provisions of the limited partnership laws of a number of states in the United States, most notably Delaware. The Marshall Islands Act also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the Delaware Revised Uniform Partnership Act and, so long as it does not conflict with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of the Marshall Islands courts, interpreted according to the non-statutory law (or case law) of the State of Delaware. There have been, however, few, if any, court cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the Marshall Islands Act, in contrast to Delaware, which has a fairly well-developed body of case law interpreting its limited partnership statute. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as the courts in Delaware. For example, the rights of our unitholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our general partner under Marshall Islands law are not as clearly established as under judicial precedent in existence in Delaware. As a result, unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by our general partner and its officers and directors than would unitholders of a similarly organized limited partnership in the United States. Because we are organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands, it may be difficult to serve us with legal process or enforce judgments against us, our directors or our management. We are organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands, and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, our general partner is a Marshall Islands limited liability company, and our 26 Table of Contents directors and officers generally are or will be non-residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of these non-residents are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for our unitholders to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States if our unitholders believe that their rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise. Even if our unitholders are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Marshall Islands and of other jurisdictions may prevent or restrict our unitholders from enforcing a judgment against our assets or the assets of our general partner or our directors or officers. Tax Risks In addition to the following risk factors, you should read Item 4. Information on the PartnershipBusiness OverviewTaxation of the Partnership and Item 10. Additional InformationTaxation for a more complete discussion of the expected material U.S. federal and non-U.S. income tax considerations relating to us and the ownership and disposition of our common units. We are subject to taxes, which reduces our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We and our subsidiaries may be subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which we are organized or operate, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution. In computing our tax obligation in these jurisdictions, we are required to take various tax accounting and reporting positions on matters that are not entirely free from doubt and for which we have not received rulings from the governing authorities. We cannot assure you that, upon review of these positions, the applicable authorities will agree with our positions. A successful challenge by a tax authority could result in additional tax imposed on us or our subsidiaries, further reducing the cash available for distribution. In addition, changes in our operations or ownership could result in additional tax being imposed on us or our subsidiaries in jurisdictions in which operations are conducted. U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which would have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. unitholders. A non-U.S. entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be treated as a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if at least 75.0% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of passive income or at least 50.0% of the average value of its assets produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For purposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property, and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties that are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute passive income. U.S. unitholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC, and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their interests in the PFIC. Based on our current and projected method of operation, we believe that we were not a PFIC for any prior taxable year, and we expect that we will not be treated as a PFIC for the current or any future taxable year. We believe that more than 25% of our gross income for each taxable year was or will be non-passive income, and more than 50% of the average value of our assets for each such year was or will be held for the production of non-passive income. This belief is based on certain valuations and projections, and its validity is based on the accuracy of such valuations and projections. While we believe these valuations and projections to be accurate, the shipping market is volatile and no assurance can be given that they will continue to be accurate at any time in the future. Moreover, there are legal uncertainties involved in determining whether the income derived from time-chartering activities constitutes rental income or income derived from the performance of services. In Tidewater Inc. v. United States, 565 F.3d 299 (5th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Fifth Circuit) held that income derived from certain time-chartering activities should be treated as rental income rather than services income for purposes of a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), relating to foreign sales corporations. In that case, the Fifth Circuit did not address the definition of passive income or the PFIC rules; however, the reasoning of the case could have implications as to how the income from a time charter would be classified under such rules. If the reasoning of this case were extended to the PFIC context, the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time-chartering activities may be treated as rental income, 27 Table of Contents and we would likely be treated as a PFIC. In published guidance, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) stated that it disagreed with the holding in Tidewater and specified that time charters similar to those at issue in the case should be treated as service contracts. We have not sought, and we do not expect to seek, an IRS ruling on the treatment of income generated from our time-chartering activities. As a result, the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. No assurance can be given that this result will not occur. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid, to the extent possible, being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future, or that we will not be a PFIC in the future. If the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year (and regardless of whether we remain a PFIC for any subsequent taxable year), our U.S. unitholders would face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. Please read Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationU.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. HoldersPFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. unitholders if we are treated as a PFIC. We may have to pay tax on U.S. source income, which would reduce our cash flow. Under the Code, U.S. source gross transportation income generally is subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax without allowance for deduction of expenses, unless an exemption from tax applies under a tax treaty or Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. U.S. source gross transportation income consists of 50% of the gross shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States. We expect that our vessel-owning subsidiaries will qualify for an exemption from U.S. tax on any U.S. source gross transportation income under the Convention Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Norway with Respect to Taxes on Income and Property (the U.S.-Norway Tax Treaty), and we intend to take this position for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, if we acquire interests in vessel-owning subsidiaries in the future that are not Norwegian residents for purposes of the U.S.-Norway Tax Treaty, U.S. source gross transportation income earned by those subsidiaries would generally be subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax unless the exemption under Section 883 of the Code applied. In general, the Section 883 exemption provides that if a non-U.S. corporation satisfies the requirements of Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, it will not be subject to the 4% U.S. federal income tax referenced above on its U.S. source gross transportation income. The Section 883 exemption does not apply to income attributable to transportation that begins and ends in the United States. The vessels in our fleet do not currently engage in transportation that begins and ends in the United States, and we do not expect that our subsidiaries will in the future earn income from such transportation. If, notwithstanding this expectation, our subsidiaries earn income in the future from transportation that begins and ends in the United States, that income would not be exempt from U.S. federal income tax under the U.S.-Norway Tax Treaty or Section 883 of the Code and would be subject to a 35% net income tax in the United States. The imposition of U.S. federal income tax on our income could have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our unitholders. Our unitholders may be subject to income tax in one or more non-U.S. jurisdictions as a result of owning our common units if, under the laws of any such jurisdiction, we are considered to be carrying on business there. Such laws may require our unitholders to file a tax return with, and pay taxes to, those jurisdictions. We conduct our affairs and cause each of our subsidiaries to operate its business in a manner that minimizes income taxes imposed upon us and our subsidiaries. Furthermore, we conduct our affairs and cause each of our subsidiaries to operate its business in a manner that minimizes the risk that unitholders may be treated as having a permanent establishment or taxable presence in a jurisdiction where we or our subsidiaries conduct activities simply by virtue of their ownership of our common units. However, because we are organized as a partnership, there is a risk in some jurisdictions, including Norway, that our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries may rise to the level of a taxable presence that is attributed to our unitholders for tax purposes. We have obtained confirmation from the United Kingdom HM Revenue & Customs that unitholders should not be treated as trading in the United Kingdom merely by virtue of their ownership of our common units. If our unitholders are attributed such a taxable presence in a jurisdiction, our unitholders may be required to file a tax return with, and to pay tax in, that jurisdiction based on our unitholders allocable share of our income. In addition, we may be required to obtain information from 28 Table of Contents our unitholders in the event a tax authority (including in the United Kingdom) requires such information to submit a tax return. We may be required to reduce distributions to our unitholders on account of any tax withholding obligations imposed upon us by that jurisdiction in respect of such allocation to our unitholders. The United States may not allow a tax credit for any foreign income taxes that our unitholders directly or indirectly incur by virtue of an investment in us.
