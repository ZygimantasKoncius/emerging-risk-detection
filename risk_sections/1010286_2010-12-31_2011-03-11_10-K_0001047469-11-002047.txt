ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS While the following are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider, they are not the only risks or uncertainties facing us or that may adversely affect our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business. If any of these risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed substantially. Risks Related to our Business Operations We expect to incur operating and net losses and negative cash flows for the next few years. We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows since our inception, and we expect that we will continue to incur operating and net losses and negative cash flows for the next few years as we continue to invest to expand our network. As a result, we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to: acquire and retain customers; react to changes, including but not limited to technological changes, in the markets we target; deploy our services in a timely manner and expand into additional markets; expand our network capacity to support rapidly growing bandwidth; respond to competitive pressures; manage costs; attract and retain experienced and talented personnel; and establish strategic and maintain existing business relationships. Our historical revenue may not be indicative of future revenue. If the prices for our communications services decrease, and if we are unable to offer additional services from which we can derive additional revenue or otherwise reduce our operating expenses, our operating results will decline and our business and financial results will suffer. 18 Table of Contents We believe we will require significant funds in the near future, which may not be available to us, to operate and expand our business. As of December 31, 2010, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $21.3 million. However, our business is capital intensive, and we believe we will require additional amounts to fund capital expenditures and pay operating expenses in the near future. We will also require additional capital to finance our current growth plans, take advantage of business opportunities or pursue potential acquisitions. To raise additional capital, we may be required to issue additional equity securities in public or private offerings or to seek significant additional debt financing. We may be unable to secure such additional financing when needed, on acceptable terms or at all, which could harm our business. In addition, any financing we do obtain could be subject to onerous terms. Any additional debt financing could cause us to incur significant interest expense and increase our future financial commitments, and any additional equity financing could be dilutive to our stockholders. If we are unable to secure capital when needed, we may be required to change our business plans and curtail our operations, and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. We may be unable to successfully execute any of our currently identified business opportunities or future business opportunities that we determine to pursue. In order to pursue business opportunities, we will need to continue to build our infrastructure and operational capabilities. Our ability to do any of these successfully could be affected by one or more of the following factors: market acceptance of our services; our ability to execute our business strategy, which could be affected by our limited experience in providing high-speed transmission services; our ability to effectively manage our third party relationships; our ability to negotiate acceptable agreements to secure suitable locations for our radios and antennas; our ability to manage the expansion of our operations, which could result in increased costs, high employee turnover or damage to customer relationships; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may be affected by the significant competition in our industry for persons experienced in network operations and engineering; equipment failure or interruption of service, which could adversely affect our reputation and our relations with our customers; our ability to respond to regulatory or policy changes in our industry; our ability to accurately predict and respond to the rapid technological changes in our industry and the evolving demands of the markets we serve; and our ability to raise substantial additional capital to fund our growth. Our failure to adequately address one or more of the above factors would have a significant impact on our ability to implement our business plan with respect to mobile backhaul and fiber network extensions and our ability to pursue other opportunities that arise, which might negatively affect our business. 19 Table of Contents We may experience difficulties in constructing, upgrading and maintaining our network, which could adversely affect customer satisfaction, increase carrier turnover and reduce revenues. We may experience quality deficiencies, cost overruns and delays on construction, maintenance and upgrade projects, including the portions of those projects not within our control, and be unable to build and source fiber in a timely manner and within our budget. The construction of networks for backhaul services also requires the receipt of permits and approvals from numerous governmental bodies, including municipalities and zoning boards. Such bodies often limit the expansion of transmission towers and other necessary construction. Failure to receive approvals in a timely fashion can delay system rollouts and raise the cost of completing construction projects. In addition, we typically must obtain rights from land, building and tower owners to install our antennas and other equipment to provide our services. We may not be able to obtain, on terms acceptable to us, or at all, the rights necessary to construct our network and expand our services. We also face challenges in managing and operating our network. These challenges include operating, maintaining and upgrading network and customer premises equipment to accommodate increased traffic or technological advances, and managing the sales, advertising, customer support, billing and collection functions of the business while providing reliable network service at expected speeds and levels of quality. The failure in any of these areas could adversely affect customer satisfaction, increase subscriber turnover, increase costs, decrease our revenues and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We are a relatively new entrant into a highly concentrated market with few potential customers. There are only a limited number of national mobile wireless carriers in any given regional market and typically fewer than four to seven mobile wireless carriers in any given market who are potential customers for mobile wireless carrier backhaul services. Our business strategy will depend on maintaining and growing customer relationships with a small number of national mobile wireless carriers and additional wireless carriers in each market. The competitors in this market, including large telephone companies, enjoy long-standing and established relationships with all of the mobile wireless carriers. If we are unable to secure and maintain a minimum number of ongoing and growing relationships with carrier customers in each market, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our top four customers accounted for 87%, and one of these customers accounted for 44%, of our revenues in 2010. AT&T Mobility accounted for 44% of our revenues in 2010, 39% of our revenues in 2009 and 40% of our revenues in 2008. In addition, 19% of our 2010 revenues were from Sprint Nextel, 12% of our 2010 revenues were from Clearwire Corporation and 12% of our 2010 revenues were from T-Mobile. If we were to lose any of AT&T Mobility, Sprint Nextel, Clearwire or T-Mobile as a customer, or if any of them reduced their usage of our services, our business, financial condition and operating results would be harmed. In addition, if any of these customers were to encounter financial difficulties or become financially unable to pay our fees, our business could be adversely affected. In February 2011, we received an early termination notice from Clearwire to terminate service at approximately 220 billing locations effective February 28, 2011 and that they are reviewing approximately 50 additional locations for possible early termination by March 31, 2011. These billing locations represent up to approximately $344 thousand in monthly service revenue. The monthly billing revenue terminated and being reviewed for termination represent a portion of our total service contracted by Clearwire. We also consider at potential risk of termination the approximately $426 thousand remaining monthly billing revenue from Clearwire. See Note 17, Subsequent Events, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 20 Table of Contents The success of our business strategy relies on the continued growth of the mobile wireless services industry and high-bandwidth broadband mobile applications in the U.S. The demand for backhaul services, including those we offer, depends on the continued growth of the mobile wireless services industry. The provision of mobile wireless services represents an evolving sector of the telecommunications industry, and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including: the continued development and market acceptance of mobile devices enabled for mobile applications; the continued development and use of high-bandwidth mobile applications; historical perceptions regarding the burdens and unreliability of previous mobile wireless technologies; high rates of consumer adoption of mobile applications; increased levels of usage by subscribers; increased or burdensome government presence through policy and regulatory changes; and increases in the number of overall subscribers. If the mobile wireless carrier industry demand for backhaul services does not continue to grow through new subscriber additions and the adoption of high-bandwidth 3G and 4G (such as WiMax or LTE) applications, or for any other reason, our operations and financial performance will be adversely affected. Our revenues depend on the sale of backhaul circuits for mobile wireless carriers. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from the sale of backhaul and related services to mobile wireless carriers. We expect that we will continue to derive a substantial majority of our revenues from these services in the future. Any competitor's substitute service with similar performance and coverage characteristics and a lower cost structure could create downward price pressure and adversely affect our sales efforts. In addition, competing technologies could be developed that make our services obsolete. Accordingly, any changes in demand for our services, whether due to pricing pressure, technological changes, or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to attract customers and maintain and increase our sales. Our competitors include or could include: incumbent and competitive local exchange carriers who offer T-1, DS-3 and higher bandwidth services or Ethernet-based backhaul services; cable multiple system operators offering either T-1, DS-3 and higher bandwidth circuits or Ethernet-based backhaul services; mobile wireless carriers building proprietary backhaul networks; fiber services providers with metro area network and distribution facilities; satellite providers providing high capacity backhaul services; other fixed-wireless service providers using unlicensed or licensed spectrum, suitable for high-bandwidth transport services; and 21 Table of Contents electric utilities and other providers offering or planning to offer broadband access over power lines. Moreover, we expect other existing and prospective competitors to adopt technologies or business plans similar to ours, or to seek other means to develop a product competitive with our services. Many competitors are well-established and have larger and better developed networks and systems, longer-standing relationships with customers and suppliers, greater name recognition and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. These competitors can often subsidize competing services with revenues from other sources, such as consumer services, content or advertising, and thus may offer their services at lower prices. These or other competitors may also reduce the prices of their services significantly or may offer backhaul connectivity with other services, which could make their services more attractive to customers. Given the intense competition, we may be unable to compete effectively with these and other technologies and service providers and, consequently, we may be unable to attract customers and grow and maintain our sales, or we may experience difficulty in developing long-term opportunities. An economic or wireless telecommunications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business. Slowdowns in the U.S. economy or in the telecommunications industry may impact consumer demand for wireless services, thereby reducing demand for our backhaul services. In addition, these slowdowns could negatively impact the debt and equity markets, thereby reducing demand for our services by causing wireless carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3G, 4G and other wireless broadband services. Further, the threat of terrorist attacks and the political and economic uncertainties resulting from these threats, uncertainties and other unforeseen events may impose additional risks upon and adversely affect the wireless telecommunications industry and our business. Competitors or customers may acquire radio spectrum for the purpose of offering similar fixed wireless services, which could impact our growth and negatively affect our operating results. The FCC and the U.S. Commerce Department each control a substantial amount of radio spectrum that may be procured through auction, application, or other licensing mechanisms and used for provision of fixed wireless services. Fixed wireless radio spectrum could be acquired by companies through sale or lease for the purpose of competing with us. Additionally, companies that we might serve with our wireless operations may elect to acquire spectrum or use spectrum they already control and develop their own fixed wireless networks. Moreover, certain unlicensed technologies may be used to provide services that could be used to compete with our services. Any of these events could adversely affect our business. We depend on third parties to help deploy and maintain our infrastructure and equipment to deliver our services. We rely on third-party contractors to deploy and, in certain markets, to maintain the infrastructure and equipment needed to provide our services. None of these third parties are contractually obligated to continue providing these services to us for any specific period of time. There are inherent risks in relying on third parties to provide these services, including: the third parties could cease providing these services, which would require us to obtain the services from other third-party contractors or develop the capability to perform these services internally; 22 Table of Contents reduced control over delivery schedules and quality of work; or defects in third-party work may not be discovered until after services have been provided, which could lead to outages, decreased performance levels and customer dissatisfaction. If these third-party contractors are unable to provide quality services to us at reasonable prices, or if these third-party providers cease providing these services, our business could be harmed. In addition, we depend on certain single source suppliers that supply components used in our network to deliver our services. If we need alternative sources for key component parts for any reason, these component parts may not be immediately available to us. If alternative suppliers are not immediately available, we will have to identify and qualify alternative suppliers, and production or delivery of these components may be delayed. We may not be able to find an adequate alternative supplier in a reasonable time period, or on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Interruption or failure of information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to provide services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. We have experienced service interruptions in some markets in the past and may experience service interruptions or system failures in the future. If we experience frequent or persistent system or network failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. We may make significant capital expenditures to increase the reliability of our systems, but these capital expenditures may not achieve the expected results. In some of our markets, some of our network facilities do not have redundant components. Accordingly, if one of these components were to fail for any reason, our network may not be able to achieve satisfactory performance levels and may even suffer outages. Any service disruptions may have an immediate and significant impact on our ability to attract, retain, and grow customer revenues, which would harm our business and operating results. We also depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to or failure of these systems could result in interruptions in service. Interruptions in service could reduce revenues and harm operating results, and our brand could be damaged if people believe the network is unreliable. These systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, riots, acts of war, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems, and similar events. Some systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning may not be adequate. The occurrence of a natural disaster or unanticipated problems at any network center could result in lengthy interruptions in service and adversely affect operating results. If our data security measures are breached, our reputation and business may be harmed. We rely on the security of our networks to deliver our services to customers. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate preventive measures against unauthorized access or sabotage. Consequently, unauthorized parties may overcome these security systems and obtain access to data on the network. We may incur costs associated with the unauthorized use of our networks including administrative and capital costs associated with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidence of fraud. In addition, because we operate and control the network and the customers' network connectivity, unauthorized access or sabotage of our network could result in damage to our network and to the computers or other devices used by customers or carriers. An actual or perceived breach of network security, regardless of whether the breach is our fault, could harm public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures, adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, expose us to significant liability and adversely affect our business prospects. 23 Table of Contents The industry in which we operate is continually evolving. Our services may become obsolete, and we may not be able to develop competitive products or services on a timely basis or at all. The mobile wireless services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements. The backhaul infrastructure that supports this dynamic industry must be similarly flexible and able to adapt to these changes. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these challenges and to offer competitive services on a timely basis. We face a number of difficulties and uncertainties associated with this reliance on technological development, such as: competition from service providers using other means to deliver similar or alternative services; competition from new service providers using more efficient, less expensive technologies, including products or services not yet invented or developed; customers self-provisioning their own backhaul services; gaining and sustaining market acceptance of the technology underlying our services; realizing economies of scale; responding successfully to advances in competing technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner; migration toward standards-based technology, requiring substantial capital expenditures; and existing, proposed or undeveloped technologies that may render fixed wireless backhaul and other services less profitable or obsolete. For example, a significant majority of our current customer contracts provide T-1 backhaul service. These contracts generally have a five-year term, and a significant number of these contracts expire each year. As a result of increased data usage by cell phone users, we expect our customers will generally not renew this T-1 backhaul service, but will instead seek backhaul service, such as Ethernet backhaul service that we provide, that has greater data capacity. If we are unable to obtain replacement contracts, whether for Ethernet service or otherwise, upon expiration of our T-1 contracts, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. As the services offered by us and our competitors develop, wireless carriers may not accept our services as a commercially viable alternative to other means of delivering wireless backhaul and other services. Accordingly, our inability to keep pace with technological development could materially and adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued availability of leases or licenses for our communications facilities. We lease communications facilities from the owners of towers, rooftops, water towers, utility poles and other structures. We typically seek five year initial terms for our leases with three, five year renewal options. The renewal options are generally at our option with a window of 90 to 180 days before the expiration of each term in which to terminate the agreement. If these leases are terminated or if the owners of these structures are unwilling to continue to enter into leases or licenses with us in the future, we would have to seek alternative arrangements with other providers. If we are unable to continue to obtain or renew leases on satisfactory terms, our business would be harmed. In some cases, some of our communications facilities or some of our equipment may not have been installed with valid lease agreements and/or proper permits in place. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful to remediate these lease agreements and/or permits. In such a case, if a facilities owner were to challenge our ability to operate on that site, the resolution of the matter may 24 Table of Contents require the termination of service to the customer, or an increase in operating costs associated with the locations, which could adversely affect operating results. We do business with an affiliated third party and may not have obtained the same terms as from an unaffiliated provider. We lease communications facilities from subsidiaries of one of our stockholders, Crown Castle, which owned approximately 5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2010. While we believe our terms are at market rate, we may not have obtained the same lease terms with this stockholder as we might have obtained from unaffiliated providers. To be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and the inability to do so could seriously harm us. To be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. Competition for personnel throughout our industry is intense, and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract or retain other highly qualified employees in the future. If we are not successful in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. Our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills, experience, performance and continued services of our senior management and other key personnel. We believe that our future success is highly dependent on our senior management to provide significant continuity in the execution of our growth plans. The loss of any members of our management team could harm our business. We have little experience with customer renewal rates and it is difficult to predict the extent of customer renewals for our services. We sell our services pursuant to service agreements that typically have a term of five years, but which may vary in term from 18 months to seven years. Customers have no obligation to renew after the expiration of their initial subscription period and no assurance can be given that customers will renew at the same or higher levels of service, if at all. Moreover, under some circumstances, some of these customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms of their agreements. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals, and we cannot accurately predict future customer renewal rates. Renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the services, the prices of the services, the prices of the services offered by competitors or mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base. If customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on less favorable terms, revenues may decline and our business will suffer. We have experienced growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately. We have substantially expanded our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations in recent periods. We increased our total number of full-time employees from 29 on December 31, 2003 to 160 on December 31, 2010. On March 3, 2011, we implemented a reduction in force throughout FiberTower resulting in a reduction of approximately 10% of our employee headcount. See Note 17, Subsequent Events, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During the period from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2010, we made substantial investments in network infrastructure, growing from 121 sites deployed and billing to 3,276 sites deployed and 2,944 deployed and billing sites as of December 31, 2010. We will need to continue to expand our business, including the number of billing sites. We anticipate that this expansion will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in infrastructure. Our historic expansion has placed, and our expected future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage growth successfully, our business will be harmed. 25 Table of Contents We may from time to time pursue strategic transactions, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We may evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, in the future. The process of acquiring and integrating a company, business or technology is risky, may require a disproportionate amount of management or financial resources, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties or expenditures. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. Acquisitions could also expose our business to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with entering new markets or businesses. Even if we are successful in integrating our acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expect from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of capital resources without the anticipated returns on such capital. In addition, future acquisitions may require additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We are subject to comprehensive and continually evolving regulation that could increase our costs and adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business plan. We and some of our communications services and installations are regulated by the FCC, state agencies, local zoning authorities, and other governmental entities. Our failure to comply with these requirements may have an adverse effect on our licenses or operations and could result in sanctions, fines or other penalties. These regulators regularly conduct new rulemaking proceedings and also issue interpretations of existing rules. For example, the FCC has a number of proceedings still pending to interpret or implement the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and these regulatory proceedings could impose additional obligations on us, give rights to competitors, increase our costs, and otherwise adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan. Congress could also enact new legislation that could restrict the manner in which we conduct our business, impose additional obligations on us, assist our competitors in competing against us or otherwise harm our business. Additional Risks Related to our FCC Licenses If we do not retain, obtain or maintain rights to use licensed spectrum in one or more markets, we may be unable to operate in these markets, which could harm our business and our ability to execute our business strategy. Since we plan to provide services using licensed spectrum, we will be dependent on our ability to retain, acquire and maintain sufficient rights to use licensed spectrum by retaining our own licenses and acquiring additional microwave radio spectrum licenses, or long-term spectrum leases, in each of the markets in which we operate. Obtaining additional licensed spectrum can be a long, difficult and costly process that can require a significant amount of management resources. We may not be able to acquire, lease or maintain the spectrum necessary to execute our business strategy. The FCC may cancel or revoke our licenses for past or future violations of the FCC's rules, which could limit our operations and growth. As an FCC licensee, we are subject to extensive regulatory oversight. For example, the FCC imposes requirements on the construction and technical aspects of the operation of our licenses and wireless communication systems and on the nature of the services that we can provide within a particular frequency band. The FCC's regulations also require various regulatory filings and fees. The FCC may find that our filings made and fees paid are insufficient. The FCC also may find that the operation of our licenses or wireless communication systems violates the FCC's rules or policies. Findings of violations by the FCC may result in fines and/or sanctions. Moreover, under some circumstances, our licenses may be canceled or conditioned, and in extreme cases, our licenses may be 26 Table of Contents revoked. In addition, the FCC could change its regulations of our operations and licenses, which could impact our business. The FCC also could change its regulation of our wireless customers that are using our backhaul services, thereby impacting our operations and growth. The value of our FCC licenses could decline, which could materially affect our ability to raise capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The carrying value of our wide-area fixed wireless FCC spectrum licenses comprises a significant portion of our assets. A decline in the value of our FCC licenses could negatively impact our ability to raise capital both privately and in the public markets and could significantly reduce the value and the attractiveness of our stock to investors. The value of any or all of our FCC licenses could decrease as a result of many factors, including: increases in the supply of licensed or leased spectrum that provides similar functionality; new radio technology in unlicensed bands that provides the same capability as our network; a decrease in the demand for services offered with any of our FCC licenses; lower values placed on similar licenses in future FCC auctions; regulatory limitations on the use, transfer or assignment of any of our FCC licenses; or bankruptcy or liquidation of any comparable companies. Many of these factors depend on circumstances beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues and on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Also, if the value declines, impairment charges might be necessary which would negatively impact operating results and might lead to a conclusion that the FCC spectrum assets are no longer indefinite lived intangible assets in which case they would then have to be amortized over their remaining useful lives which would negatively impact results of operations. As a result of the impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2008 of the carrying value of our FCC licenses, which was conducted in connection with the preparation of our 2008 consolidated financial statements we determined that the fair value of our FCC licenses was less than their carrying value. Consequently, the carrying value of our FCC licenses was reduced by $54.5 million to $287.5 million at December 31, 2008. The impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 of the carrying value of our FCC licenses resulted in the determination that the fair value of our FCC licenses was greater than their carrying value. Therefore, no additional reduction to their carrying value was required in 2010 or 2009. Future impairment evaluations of our FCC licenses could lead to additional material impairment charges. Any operating losses resulting from impairment charges to FCC licenses or other long-lived assets would have an adverse effect on our future financial results and could have an adverse effect on our stock price. See Note 6, Impairment of FCC Licenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may be required to make certain FCC filings in the future and may be subject to fines and/or sanctions for failure to file in the past. Prior to the merger with Old FiberTower, First Avenue had taken the position that it was not obligated to submit certain revenue reporting forms required by the FCC's rules to be filed by certain providers of telecommunications services. These forms are the basis of payments assessed by the FCC in support of universal service, numbering administration, telecommunications relay services for the deaf, and local number portability. The FCC could determine that such revenue reporting filings should have been made and that FiberTower should be assessed a fine and/or be required to make any and all 27 Table of Contents payments such filings might necessitate. While Old FiberTower filed such revenue reporting forms prior to the First Avenue/FiberTower merger, those revenues did not meet the FCC's threshold for Old FiberTower to make payments to the FCC's programs described above. There can be no assurance that the FCC would accept a decision by FiberTower to suspend such filings in the future. Our FCC licenses may not be renewed upon expiration in the future, which could limit the expansion of our business and our ability to serve our customers and could harm our operating results. Our spectrum licenses in the 24 GHz and 39 GHz bands are granted for ten-year terms with renewal dates ranging from 2010 to 2021. In October 2008, renewal applications for 39 GHz licenses that were scheduled to expire in 2007 received either (1) ten-year renewals for licenses deemed constructed or (2) ten year renewals contingent upon meeting construction requirements which the FCC extended until June 1, 2012. Recent applications to renew licenses that met the FCC "safe harbor" build standard or extend construction deadlines for 39 GHz licenses expiring in 2009, 2010 and 2011 have been granted by the FCC. In order for our 24 GHz and 39 GHz licenses to qualify for renewal in the future, we must file renewal applications for each license prior to expiration and demonstrate that we have provided "substantial service" by the end of the term of each license (which was February 1, 2011 for 102 of the 103 24 GHz licenses) or reserved the right to make such a showing by an FCC approved substantial service showing date (which is June 1, 2012 for a substantial majority of the 39 GHz licenses and all but one of the 24 GHz licenses). The FCC's substantial service renewal standard for both the 24 GHz and 39 GHz licenses is intended to provide licensees with flexibility in demonstrating usage of their licenses. The FCC's "safe harbor" test provides licensees with a degree of certainty as to how to comply with the substantial service requirement. For example, for 39 GHz licensees offering point-to-point service, the FCC has said that the construction of four links per channel per million persons in the license area will meet the substantial service test. For 24 GHz point-to-point/multipoint licensees, the FCC has said that a showing of four links per million persons within a service area or service to an area that has very limited access to either wireless or wireline telecommunications services will meet the substantial service test. FCC precedent also exists in the millimeter wave bands for meeting buildout requirements by constructing a point-to-multipoint system whose signal reaches 20% or more of the population in the license area. While the safe harbors are intended to provide guidance, they are not the only way for licensees to demonstrate substantial service. Licensees may show that they have met the substantial service test in other ways, such as providing niche services or offering services to underserved consumers, however, there is little precedent in this area at this time. Accordingly, we believe that the level of service that will be considered "substantial" by the FCC at renewal may vary depending upon the type of product offering by the licensee. Further, the FCC may modify its perception of substantial service and, in the future, we may encounter more stringent substantial service requirements. License renewal is not guaranteed and the FCC holds significant discretion in making renewal decisions. The loss of some number of our licenses could limit the expansion of our business, cause us to take impairment charges to our FCC licenses intangible asset and harm our operating results. We do not currently meet the substantial service safe harbor guidance provided by the FCC for the substantial majority of our 24 GHz and 39 GHz licenses, which require license construction or "substantial service" showings mostly by June 1, 2012. We believe that our licenses will be renewed based on (1) our significant network investment, (2) spectrum offerings, (3) market leadership, (4) expanding geographic coverage and (5) the ability to convey to the FCC information about best practices for refreshing the license renewal standards through the Uniform License Renewal proceeding described above in "Item 1. BusinessRegulatory EnvironmentFederal Regulation and Programs." We are uncertain as to whether this proceeding, which also addresses the spectrum bands that our mobile customers use to operate their networks, will prove to be a catalyst or an obstacle to wireless network operators, depending upon whether the license renewal standards ultimately adopted are market-oriented. Since we are required to demonstrate substantial service at the time licenses are 28 Table of Contents renewed, the FCC has little and possibly changing precedent in the 24 GHz and 39 GHz bands, and determination of substantial service is subject to FCC discretion, the FCC could choose to not renew licenses that do not meet the substantial service safe harbor. Our reliance upon spectrum licensed by the FCC includes additional risks. Our use of FCC-licensed spectrum imposes additional risks on our business, including: increases in spectrum acquisition costs; adverse changes to regulations governing spectrum/licensee rights; the risk that spectrum will not be commercially usable or free of harmful interference from licensed or unlicensed operators in our or adjacent bands; the risk that the government or other license holders introduce an oversupply of substantially similar spectrum into the market; contractual disputes with or the bankruptcy or other reorganization of the license holders, which could adversely affect control over the spectrum subject to such license; the risk that competitors, customers or other users may over utilize point-to-point licensed spectrum and thus alter the FCC availability or allocation of such microwave radio spectrum in markets or geographic areas where we require it; change in the FCC rules regarding the licensing of microwave radio spectrum; and invalidation of any authorization to use all or a significant portion of the spectrum, resulting in, among other things, impairment charges related to assets recorded for such spectrum. Common carrier regulation could increase our costs and result in a decline in our operations, revenues and profitability. Although there has been a narrowing of the differences in regulatory requirements applicable to common carriers and private transmission companies in recent years, the FCC regulations applicable to common carriers remains more extensive. Generally, the Communications Act regards firms that offer transmission services directly to the public for a fee as common carriers. We currently offer our fixed wireless services to particular customers with specific needs on an individual contract basis and we traditionally do not hold ourselves out to the public for the provision of our services. As such, we operated as a private carrier not subject to the FCC's common carrier regulations. Nonetheless, as we grow, especially in the fiber optic market, there are benefits to operating as a common carrier, including enhanced access to ducts, conduits, rights-of-way and poles. Accordingly, we began the process for filing for common carrier status in selected markets in 2010, and expect those filings to occur throughout 2011. It is possible that states or the FCC could determine that such common carrier filings were required sooner than expected, and thus impose common carrier obligations sooner. Alternatively, any of our potential future requests for common carrier status may not be granted. In addition, operating as a common carrier will likely increase certain compliance requirements and costs of providing service, which could have an adverse impact on our business operations, revenues, and profitability. FCC Regulation of radio frequency emissions and radio frequency environments may increase our costs and/or limit our operations. The FCC regulates the health and safety effects of radio frequency emissions for us and other wireless communications providers. Any FCC licensee whose emissions in an area exceed five percent (5%) of the total permissible emissions limit is responsible for ensuring that the site meets applicable 29 Table of Contents health and safety requirements. The fixed wireless equipment we use is designed to operate at RF emission levels well below the FCC's standard. However, if we operate in an area where other higher RF emitters are operating, we could nonetheless be required to cooperate with, and contribute financially to, efforts intended to bring the site within applicable health and safety limits. FCC, Congressional or State action that requires Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) to artificially lower and cap their special access transport pricing could result in pricing pressure on FiberTower. The FCC, Congress and the States possess the ability to require ILECs to artificially lower and cap their special access transport pricing. If the ILECs were required to significantly drop their backhaul pricing in our markets, our customers might then find our pricing unattractive. Additional Risks Related to our Indebtedness To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our business does not currently generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service the interest on the Notes due 2012 and Notes due 2016. Our annual cash interest payments on these notes are approximately $6.0 million in 2011 and 2012. When we issued the Notes due 2016, we deposited into an escrow account approximately $11.0 million which, together with the earnings thereon, was an amount sufficient to pay the cash portion of the first six semi-annual interest payments on the Notes due 2016. Two-thirds of the interest payable on the Notes due 2016 will be paid by issuing new Notes due 2016. We elected to pay the May 2009, November 2009, May 2010 and November 2010 interest payments on the Notes due 2012 entirely by the issuance of additional Notes due 2012, as permitted under the related indenture. This resulted in the issuance of an additional $33.5 million in 2009 and $3.1 million in 2010 in principal amount of Notes due 2012. The interest rate applicable to any such interest payments made in additional Notes due 2012 is 11%. Interest payments on the Notes due 2012 after November 2010 are payable only in cash. Our ability to pay our expenses and make payments due on the Notes due 2016 and the Notes due 2012 depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to pay interest or repay indebtedness, including the Notes due 2012 or the Notes due 2016, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may be required to sell assets or incur additional debt, or we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations. Our substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes due 2016 and the Notes due 2012 and any other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2010, we had $164.8 million of total indebtedness, excluding our obligation under a capital lease. The indentures governing the Notes due 2016 and Notes due 2012 allow us to enter into a senior secured credit facility and incur certain other additional indebtedness, including 30 Table of Contents pari passu senior secured indebtedness in certain circumstances. Our substantial indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, including the following: it may make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the Notes due 2016 and the Notes due 2012 and our other indebtedness and contractual and commercial commitments and, if we fail to comply with these requirements, an event of default could result; we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on the Notes due 2016 and the Notes due 2012 and any other indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes; our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited; our flexibility in reacting to changes in our industry may be limited and we could be more vulnerable to adverse changes in our business or economic conditions in general; and we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged. The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. We are a holding company, and therefore our ability to make any required payments on our indebtedness depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance funds. We have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our required obligations under the Notes due 2016 and the Notes due 2012. However, each of our subsidiaries is a legally distinct entity, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to us will be subject to, among other things, the terms of any debt instruments of our subsidiaries then in effect and applicable law. If distributions from our subsidiaries to us were eliminated, delayed, reduced or otherwise impaired, our ability to make payments on our indebtedness would be substantially impaired and an event of default could result. Despite our substantial level of indebtedness, we may still incur significantly more debt, which could exacerbate any or all of the risks described above. We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture governing the Notes due 2016 limits our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the indenture governing the Notes due 2016 does not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase. The Notes due 2016 contain restrictive covenants that limit our operational flexibility. The Notes due 2016 contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest. These covenants include restrictions on our ability to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; 31 Table of Contents pay dividends or make other distributions; issue capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries; transfer or sell assets, including the capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries; make certain investments or acquisitions; grant liens on our assets; incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to a default under the Notes due 2016. The repurchase rights in the Notes due 2016 triggered by a fundamental change could discourage a transaction that could be beneficial to the holders of our common stock. If a "fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes due 2016, and which generally includes events relating to certain changes in control) occurs prior to maturity, holders may require us to repurchase all or part of their Notes due 2016 for cash at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, up to but excluding the repurchase date. These repurchase rights in the Notes due 2016 could discourage a potential acquirer from engaging in a transaction that may be beneficial to the holders of our common stock. Risks Related to an Investment in FiberTower We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be declared or paid in the foreseeable future. In addition, the indenture governing our Notes due 2016 contains covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends. As a result, holders of our common stock may not receive a return, if any, on their investment unless they sell their shares of our common stock. Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in quarterly results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described in "Risks Related to Our Business Operations" above. We believe that, as a result of these risks, our quarterly revenues and results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on historical results as an indication of future performance. 32 Table of Contents Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting containing an assessment by management as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as an opinion by our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to assert in future years that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, that could cause our stock price to decline and could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in the future. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Changes in the composition of our stockholders, including those resulting from the issuance of common stock in the Mandatory Redemption, are likely to limit our ability to use our net operating losses. We have substantial tax loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of prior changes in the stock ownership of FiberTower, our ability to use a substantial part of such carryforwards to offset future income or tax liability is limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a result of the issuance of shares of common stock in the Mandatory Redemption, our ability to use these loss carryforwards will be restricted as a result of the ownership change. See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of FiberTower. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. For example, our certificate of incorporation provides that the Board of Directors can issue preferred stock at our discretion with respect to voting, conversion, distribution, and other rights given to stockholders, which may be used in a way to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer. In addition, if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us, the acquirer would not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting, which would require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the Board of Directors than if cumulative voting were permitted. In addition, the members of our Board of Directors are elected on a staggered or classified basis, which could prevent or deter takeovers or changes in control by increasing the time it takes for a hostile acquirer to replace board members. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law limits mergers and other business combination transactions involving 15% or greater stockholders of Delaware corporations unless certain board or stockholder approval requirements are satisfied. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Our Board of Directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer that it did not believe was in our strategic interests. If an acquirer is discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from 33 Table of Contents successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these or other measures, stockholders could lose the opportunity to sell their shares at a favorable price.
