Risk Factors THE COMPANY HAS NOT COMMENCED OPERATIONS AND IS IN A STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO DEVELOP ITS BUSINESS, SHAREHOLDERS COULD LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT The Company was incorporated on April 8, 2002 and has not yet commenced its proposed business operations or realized any revenues. It has no operating history upon which an evaluation of its future prospects can be made. Such prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by new entrants into the competitive business advisory and management consulting industry. The Company is in a development stage and could fail before implementing its business plan. The Company expects to incur operating losses in future periods for the foreseeable future as it incurs significant expenses associated with developing its business in Hong Kong and China. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be successful in realizing revenue or achieving or sustaining positive cash flow in the future, and any su ch failure could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. THE COMPANYS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE FAILURE OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL DECLINE IN REVENUES The Company is a professional services company, and its success and future growth depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees throughout its business and, in particular, experienced business advisors and management consultants. This is especially relevant, as most of the Companys revenues will be generated from the professional services provided by its business advisors and consultants. Competition for qualified business advisors and management consultants in Hong Kong and China is intense. The Company will compete for its employees with many other companies, some of which will have greater financial and other resources. The Company may have difficulty recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel, which could result in a material decline in its revenues. In addition, increased compe nsation levels could materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition or results of operations. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE SERVICES OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF PERSONNEL WHO WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE AND, IF NOT REPLACED, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY The Companys success depends significantly on the continued services of its senior management. In particular, the Companys success depends on the continued efforts of Mr. Li Sze Tang, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors and Mr. Wilson Cheung, Chief Financial Officer and a Director. Mr. Li and Mr. Cheung have significant contacts with the Hong Kong business community and are crucial for the Companys business development. Currently, the Company does not have any employment agreements with Mr. Li or Mr. Cheung and both may choose to leave employment with the Company at any time. Additionally, neither Mr. Li nor Mr. Cheung has entered into a non-compete or confidentiality agreement with the Company. Finally, the Company does not carry key-man life insurance policies for either Mr. Li or Mr. Cheung. The re can be no assurance that either Mr. Li or Mr. Cheung will continue in their present capacities for any particular period of time. The loss of the services of Mr. Li or Mr. Cheung could materially and adversely affect the Companys ability to attract clients and to employ and retain qualified business advisors 6 and consultants, which would have an adverse impact on its profitability. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, WHICH WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION A key element of the Companys strategy is dependant on the ability of its senior management to identify the business advisory needs of its prospective clients and developing business connections. Future growth will also depend upon many other factors, including (a) the recruitment and retention of qualified business and management consultants and other professional personnel; (b) the development of a solid client base and (c) the successful marketing of our professional services. If any one or more of the Companys strategic elements are not achieved, its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. MR. LI SZE TANG, A CURRENT STOCKHOLDER, CAN EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OF THE COMPANY Mr. Li Sze Tang owns approximately 83.33% of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. As a result, he has the ability to exercise substantial control over the Companys affairs and to elect a sufficient number of directors to control the board of directors. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS IN CHINA, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY The Company expects to expand its business and client base and be able to offer its services in China. This expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources. The Companys ability to expand its services into the China markets will be limited by its ability to market to, and attract, Chinese clients. Accordingly, the Company expects to commit substantial time and development resources to developing the China market. These efforts may not be successful, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively in that market. CHANGES IN HONG KONG'S POLITICAL AND LEGAL CONDITIONS COULD HARM THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS Most of the Companys assets and its initial business will be in Hong Kong, and it will conduct most of its business activities there. As a result, results of operations and financial condition of the Company may be especially influenced by the political situation in Hong Kong and by the general state of the Hong Kong economy. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, but it has its own legislature, legal and judicial system and economic autonomy until the year 2047. The Company does not expect that this autonomy will be altered. However, any changes in political, legal or other conditions in Hong Kong altering this autonomy could have an adverse effect on the Companys business operations and revenue. CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM HAS UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD HARM THE COMPANYS FUTURE INTERESTS IN CHINA All of the Companys future business projects and plans are expected to be located in China. As a consequence, the economic, political, legal and social conditions in China could 7 have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. The legislative trend in China over the past decade has been to enhance the protection afforded to foreign investment and allow for more active control by foreign parties of foreign invested enterprises. There can be no assurance, however, that legislation directed towards promoting foreign investment will continue. More restrictive rules on foreign investment could adversely affect the Companys ability to expand its operations into China or repatriate any profits earned there. RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE MAY LIMIT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO UTILIZE ITS REVENUES EFFECTIVELY Although the Chinese government introduced policies in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the Renminbi, the unit of currency in China, significant restrictions still remain. The Company can provide no assurance that the Chinese government will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi. Because most of the Companys future revenues may be in the form of Renminbi, any future restrictions on currency exchanges may have an adverse impact on the Companys future financial condition. THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, WHICH MAKES IT LESS TRANSPARENT THAN A U.S. ISSUER As a foreign private issuer, the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides the Company with certain exemptions. The Company is exempt from the rules prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and its officers, directors and principal stockholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions. Also, the Company is not required to publish financial statements as frequently, as promptly or containing the same information as United States companies. The result is that the Company will be less transparent than a U.S. issuer. EARNINGS, IF ANY, WILL BE RETAINED AND THE COMPANY WILL NOT PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE The Company anticipates that earnings, if any, will be retained for the development of its business and that no cash dividends will be declared on its common stock for the foreseeable future. THE COMPANY IS A BVI COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THEREFORE, CERTAIN JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST THE COMPANY BY ITS SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN THE BVI The Company is a British Virgin Islands company. All of its officers and directors reside outside of the United States. All or substantially all of its assets and the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Company or such persons or to enforce against it or these persons the United States federal securities laws, or to enforce judgments obtained in United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 8 ONE OF THE COMPANYS OFFICERS IS ALSO AN OFFICER IN COMPANIES WITH SIMILAR OPERATIONS, AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MAY ARISE Mr. Li Sze Tang serves as an officer in other companies and entities, including Media Century International Ltd., whose business is providing IT consultancy services and who intends to operate in the same territories in which the Company intends to operate. The Company must compete for Mr. Li's time. Conflicts of interest may also arise between Mr. Li's duties to the Company and the other companies and entities which could detract from his efforts on behalf of the Company. THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK MAY BE SUBJECT TO PENNY STOCK REGULATION The Company's securities may subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase "accredited investors" means, in general terms, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse's income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company's securities and also may affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities in any market that might develop therefore. PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY LOSE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY The Company may consider an acquisition in which the Company would issue as consideration for the business opportunity to be acquired an amount of the Company's authorized but unissued Common Stock that would, upon issuance, represent the great majority of the voting power and equity of the Company. The result of such an acquisition would be that the acquired company's stockholders and management would control the Company, and the Company's management could be replaced by persons unknown at this time. Such a merger would result in a greatly reduced percentage of ownership of the Company by its current shareholders. In addition, in conjunction with such a transaction, the Company's current officers, directors and principal shareholders could sell their controlling block of stock at a premium price to the acquired company's stockholders.
