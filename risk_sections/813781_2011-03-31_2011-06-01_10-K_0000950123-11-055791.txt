Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company has experienced significant fluctuations in raw material prices, particularly lead, and further changes in the prices of raw materials or in energy costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Lead is the primary material used in the manufacture of batteries, representing approximately 50.6% of the Companys cost of goods sold for fiscal 2011. Average lead prices quoted on the London Metal Exchange (LME) have fluctuated dramatically, from $1,984 per metric ton for fiscal 2010 to $2,242 per metric ton for fiscal 2011. As of May 25, 2011, lead prices quoted on the LME were $2,530 per metric ton. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase the prices of its products proportionate to the increase in raw material costs, the Companys gross margins will decline. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to hedge its lead requirements at reasonable costs or that the Company will be able to pass on these costs to its customers. Fluctuations in the Companys prices could also cause customer demand for the Companys products to be reduced and net sales to decline, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Rising lead costs require the Company to make significant investments in inventory and accounts receivable, which reduces amounts of cash available for other purposes. The Company also consumes significant amounts of polypropylene, steel and other materials in its manufacturing process and incurs energy costs in connection with manufacturing and distribution of its products. The market prices of these materials are also subject to fluctuation, which could impact the Companys liquidity. In addition, the Company purchases spent batteries from third parties to provide adequate supply for the operations of its lead recycling facilities. To the extent the Company cannot purchase spent batteries in sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices, the lack of adequate supply or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The Company is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates and other risks associated with its non-U.S. operations which could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company has significant manufacturing operations in, and exports to, several countries outside the U.S. Approximately 57.1% of the Companys net sales for fiscal 2011 were generated in Europe and ROW with the significant majority generated in Euros. Because such a significant portion of the Companys operation is based overseas, the Company is exposed to foreign currency risk, resulting in uncertainty as to 10 Table of Contents future asset and liability values, and results of operations that are denominated in foreign currencies. The Company invoices foreign sales and service transactions in local currencies, using actual exchange rates during the period, and translates these revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars at average monthly exchange rates. Because a significant portion of the Companys net sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, the depreciation of these foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect the Companys reported net sales and operating margins. The Company translates its non-U.S. assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars using current rates as of the balance sheet date. Therefore, foreign currency depreciation against the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the Companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, foreign currency depreciation, particularly depreciation of the Euro, would make it more expensive for the Companys non-U.S. subsidiaries to purchase certain raw material commodities that are priced globally in U.S. Dollars, such as lead, which is quoted on the LME in U.S. Dollars. The Company does not engage in significant hedging of its foreign currency exposure and cannot assure that it will be able to hedge its foreign currency exposures at a reasonable cost. There are other risks inherent in the Companys non-U.S. operations, including:  Changes in local economic conditions, including disruption of markets;  Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in import, export, labor and environmental laws;  Exposure to possible expropriation or other government actions; and  Unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against American interests. These and other risks may have a material adverse effect on the Companys non-U.S. operations or on its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Companys liquidity is affected by the seasonality of its business. Warm winters and cool summers adversely affect the Company. The Company sells a disproportionate share of its automotive aftermarket batteries during the fall and early winter. Resellers buy automotive batteries during these periods so that they will have sufficient inventory for cold weather periods. This seasonality increases the Companys working capital requirements and makes it more sensitive to fluctuations in the availability of liquidity. Unusually cold winters or hot summers may accelerate battery failure and increase demand for automotive replacement batteries. Mild winters and cool summers may have the opposite effect. As a result, if the Companys sales are reduced by an unusually warm winter or cool summer, it may not be possible for the Company to recover these sales in later periods. Further, if the Companys sales are adversely affected by the weather, it cannot make offsetting cost reductions to protect the Companys liquidity and gross margins in the short-term because a large portion of the Companys manufacturing and distribution costs are fixed. These circumstances could result in a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Decreased demand in the industries in which the Company operates may adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Companys financial performance depends, in part, on conditions in the automotive, material handling, and telecommunications industries which, in turn, are generally dependent on the U.S. and global economies. As a result, economic and other factors adversely affecting production by OEMs and their customers spending could adversely impact the Companys business. Relatively modest declines in customer purchases from the Company could have a significant adverse impact on its profitability because the Company has substantial fixed production costs. If the Companys OEM and large aftermarket customers reduce their inventory levels, or reduce their orders, the Companys performance would be significantly adversely impacted. In this economic environment, the Company cannot predict future production rates or inventory levels or the underlying economic factors. Continued uncertainty and unexpected fluctuations may adversely affect the Companys business, financial conditions, cash flows, or results of operations. 11 Table of Contents The remaining portion of the Companys battery sales are of aftermarket batteries. The factors influencing demand for automotive replacement batteries include: (1) the number of vehicles in use; (2) average battery life; (3) the average age of vehicles and their operating environment; (4) weather conditions; (5) population growth; and (6) overall economic conditions. Any significant adverse change in any one of these factors may adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The loss of the Companys primary supplier of polyethylene battery separators would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company relies on a single supplier to fulfill certain of its needs for polyethylene battery separators  a critical component of many of the Companys products. There is no second source that could readily provide the volume of certain of its polyethylene separators used by the Company. As a result, any major disruption in supply from this supplier would have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Many of the industries in which the Company operates are cyclical. The Companys operating results are affected by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which its major customer groups operate. Any significant decline in demand for replacement batteries for automobiles, light trucks, or sport utility vehicles could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations of the Companys Transportation segments. To a lesser extent, a prolonged decline in the demand for new automobiles, light trucks or sport utility vehicles could also have an adverse impact on these segments. A weak capital expenditure environment in the telecommunications, uninterruptible power systems or electric industrial forklift truck markets could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations of the Companys Industrial Energy segments. The Company is subject to pricing pressure from its larger customers. The Company faces significant pricing pressures in all of its business segments from its larger customers. Because of their purchasing volume, the Companys larger customers can influence market participants to compete on price and other terms. Such customers also use their buying power to negotiate lower prices. If the Company is not able to offset price reductions resulting from these pressures by improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, those price reductions may have an adverse impact on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The Company faces increasing competition and pricing pressure from other companies in its industries, and if the Company is unable to compete effectively with these competitors, the Companys sales and profitability could be adversely affected. The Company competes with a number of major domestic and international manufacturers and distributors of lead-acid batteries, as well as a large number of smaller, regional competitors. Due to excess capacity in some sectors of its industry and consolidation among industrial purchasers, the Company has been subjected to continued and significant pricing pressures. The North American, European and Asian lead-acid battery markets are highly competitive. The manufacturers in these markets compete on price, quality, technical innovation, service, and warranty. In addition, the Company is experiencing heightened competitive pricing pressure as Asian producers, which are able to employ labor at significantly lower costs than producers in the U.S. and Western Europe, expand their export capacity and increase their marketing presence in the Companys major markets. If the Company is unable to compete effectively with these competitors, its sales and profitability could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. 12 Table of Contents If the Company is not able to develop new products or improve upon its existing products on a timely basis, the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected. The Company believes that its future success depends, in part, on the ability to develop, on a timely basis, new technologically advanced products or improve on the Companys existing products in innovative ways that meet or exceed its competitors product offerings. Maintaining the Companys market position will require continued investment in capital assets, research and development, and sales and marketing. Industry standards, customer expectations, or other products may emerge that could render one or more of the Companys products less desirable or obsolete. The Company may be unsuccessful in making the technological advances necessary to develop new products or improve its existing products to maintain its market position. If any of these events occur, they could cause decreases in sales and have an adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company may be adversely affected by the instability and uncertainty in the world financial markets and the global economy, and uncertainty around potential terrorist activities against global companies. Unfavorable changes in global economic conditions, including tightening credit markets, inflation or recession may result in consumers, businesses and governments deferring or lowering purchases of the Companys products in the future. In addition, terrorist activities may cause unpredictable or unfavorable economic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. These economic conditions and uncertainty also may impact the ability of the Companys customers to purchase the Companys products and services. As a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, the Companys ability to meet customers demands depends, in part, on the Companys ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from its suppliers. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent as a result of the global economic conditions, or terrorist attacks, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies. If such economic conditions persist, or terrorist attacks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The Company may be unable to successfully implement its business strategy, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Companys ability to achieve its business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. For example, the Company may not be successful in increasing its manufacturing and distribution efficiency through productivity, process improvements and cost reduction initiatives. Further, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits of these improvements and initiatives within the time frames the Company currently expects. In addition, the Company may not be successful in maintaining or increasing the Companys percentage of captive arrangements and spent-battery collections or in otherwise hedging its lead requirements, leaving it exposed to fluctuations in the price of lead. Any failure to successfully implement the Companys business strategy could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, and could further impair the Companys ability to make certain strategic capital expenditures and meet its restructuring objectives. The Company is subject to costly regulation in relation to environmental and occupational, health and safety matters, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Throughout the world, the Company manufactures, distributes, recycles, and otherwise uses large amounts of potentially hazardous materials, especially lead and acid. As a result, the Company is subject to a substantial number of costly regulations. In particular, the Company is required to comply with increasingly stringent requirements of federal, state, and local environmental, occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries, including those governing (1) emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; (2) the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste 13 Table of Contents materials; and (3) the cleanup of contaminated properties and human health and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in ongoing costs. The Company could also incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or costs to upgrade or replace existing equipment, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at its facilities. In addition, many of the Companys current and former facilities are located on properties with histories of industrial or commercial operations. Because some environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup upon any of the current or former owners or operators, regardless of fault, the Company could become liable for the cost of investigating or remediating contamination at these properties if contamination requiring such activities is discovered in the future. There is also inherent difficulty in assessing the Companys potential liability due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties. For example, a demand for the total cleanup costs of a landfill used by many entities may be asserted by the government using joint and several liability theories. Although the Company believes that there is a reasonable basis in law to believe that it will ultimately be responsible for only its share of these remediation costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail on these claims. In addition, the scope of remedial costs or other environmental injuries are highly variable, and estimating these costs involves complex legal, scientific and technical judgments. The Company may become obligated to pay material remediation-related costs at its closed Tampa, Florida facility in the amount of approximately $13.2 million to $19.9 million, and at the Columbus, Georgia facility in the amount of approximately $5.7 million to $8.5 million. The Company cannot be certain that it has been, or will at all times be, in complete compliance with all environmental requirements, or that the Company will not incur additional material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements in excess of amounts it has reserved. Private parties, including current or former employees, could bring personal injury or other claims against the Company due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored or disposed of by it, or contained in its products, especially lead. Environmental requirements are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. These requirements or their enforcement may change in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company has made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. These requirements, responsibilities and associated expenditures, if they continue to increase, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. While the Companys costs to defend and settle claims arising under environmental laws in the past have not been material, the Company cannot provide assurance that this will remain so in the future. On November 12, 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published new lead emissions standards under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which became effective on January 12, 2009. The new standards further restrict lead emissions by reducing the off-site concentration standards for lead in air from 1.5 micrograms per cubic meter to 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter. The Company believes that the new standards could impact a number of its U.S. facilities. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), publication by the EPA of these ambient air quality standards initiates a process by which the states develop rules implementing the standards. Recently, some states have accelerated their implementation and the Company is working with these states to meet their requirements. Although the final impact on the Companys operations cannot be reasonably determined at the current time, the Company believes that the financial impact of compliance with these lead emissions standards on its U.S. facilities will be funded through normal operations. Noncompliance with these standards could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Regulation and legislation adopted to address possible global climate change could increase the Companys costs of operation and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on whether emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, may be contributing to certain atmospheric and other climatic changes. Legislative and regulatory measures directed at limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases and other 14 Table of Contents possible causes of climate change are in various phases of discussions or implementation in a number of countries in which the Company operates. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the United States, and international treaties to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials and energy sources such as electricity, natural gas and fossil fuels, all of which may result in higher manufacturing and distribution costs for the Company. The Companys facilities may also be subject to additional regulation under future climate change policies. Compliance with environmental laws or regulations regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases could result in significant changes to the Companys facilities and operations and result in an increased cost of conducting business. If the Company is unable to manage the financial risks or otherwise recover costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company may be adversely affected by legal proceedings to which the Company is, or may become, a party. The Company and its subsidiaries are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The cost of resolving the Companys pre-petition disputed claims, including legal and other professional fees involved in settling or litigating these matters, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company established a reserve of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for issuance to holders of these disputed unsecured claims as the claims are allowed by the Bankruptcy Court. Effective May 6, 2011 all outstanding warrants expired and were cancelled, and no further warrants will be issued from the reserve to resolve remaining pre-petition disputed unsecured claims. Although these claims are generally resolved through the issuance of common stock from the reserve rather than cash payments, the process of resolving these claims through settlement or litigation requires considerable Company resources, including expenditures for legal and professional fees and the attention of Company personnel. These costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Work stoppages or other labor issues at the Companys facilities or its customers or suppliers facilities could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. At March 31, 2011, approximately 16% of the Companys hourly employees in the Americas and many of its non-U.S. employees were unionized. It is likely that a significant portion of the Companys workforce will remain unionized for the foreseeable future. It is also possible that the portion of the Companys workforce that is unionized may increase in the future. Contracts covering approximately 254 of the Companys domestic employees expire in fiscal 2012, and the remainder thereafter. In addition, contracts covering most of the Companys union employees in Europe and ROW expire on various dates through fiscal 2012. Although the Company believes that its relations with employees are generally good, if conflicts develop between the Company and its employees unions in connection with the renegotiation of these contracts or otherwise, work stoppages or other labor disputes could result. A work stoppage at one or more of the Companys plants, or a material increase in its costs due to unionization activities, may have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Work stoppages at the facilities of the Companys customers or suppliers may also negatively affect the Companys business. If any of the Companys significant customers experience a material work stoppage, the customer may halt or limit the purchase of the Companys products. This could require the Company to shut down or significantly reduce production at facilities relating to those products. Moreover, if any of the Companys suppliers experience a work stoppage, the Companys operations could be adversely affected if an alternative source of supply is not readily available. 15 Table of Contents The Companys substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2011, the Company had total indebtedness, including capital leases, of approximately $758.2 million. The Companys level of indebtedness could have significant consequences. For example, it could:  Limit the Companys ability to borrow money to fund its working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;  Limit the Companys flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and future business opportunities;  Make the Company more vulnerable to a downturn in its business or in the economy;  Place the Company at a disadvantage relative to some of its competitors, who may be less highly leveraged; and  Require a substantial portion of the Companys cash flow from operations to be used for debt payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. One or a combination of these factors could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Subject to restrictions in the indenture governing the Companys senior secured notes and convertible notes and its asset-backed revolving credit facility (the ABL facility), the Company may incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with its already substantial indebtedness. Restrictive covenants limit the Companys ability to operate its business and to pursue its business strategies, and its failure to comply with these covenants could result in an acceleration of its indebtedness. The ABL facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes contain covenants that limit or restrict the Companys ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to engage in other transactions or business activities that may be important to its growth strategy or otherwise important to the Company. The ABL facility Agreement and the indenture governing the Companys senior secured notes limit or restrict, among other things, the Companys ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to:  Incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;  Pay dividends or make distributions on the Companys capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments;  Purchase or redeem stock or subordinated indebtedness;  Issue stock of the Companys subsidiaries;  Make investments and extend credit;  Engage in transactions with affiliates;  Transfer and sell assets;  Effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Companys assets;  Engage in transactions with affiliates, and  Create liens on the Companys assets to secure debt. 16 Table of Contents In addition, the ABL facility requires the Company to repay outstanding borrowings with portions of the proceeds the Company receives from certain sales of property or assets and specified future debt offerings. The Companys ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond its control. Any breach of the covenants in the ABL facility or the indenture governing its senior secured notes could cause a default under the Companys ABL facility and other debt (including the notes), which would restrict the Companys ability to borrow under its ABL facility, thereby significantly impacting the Companys liquidity which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. If there were an event of default under any of the Companys debt instruments that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument to be due and payable immediately. The Companys assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under its outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. If, as or when required, the Company is unable to repay, refinance or restructure its indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, its senior secured credit facility, the lenders under that facility could institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets securing borrowings under the ABL facility. Holders of the Companys common stock are subject to the risk of dilution of their investment as the result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock to holders of pre-petition claims to the extent the reserve of common stock established to satisfy such claims is insufficient. On April 15, 2002, (the Petition Date), Exide Technologies, together with certain of its subsidiaries (the Debtors), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws (Bankruptcy Code or Chapter 11) in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors, along with the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court on February 27, 2004 and, on April 21, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan. Pursuant to the Plan, the Company has established a reserve of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for issuance to holders of unsecured pre-petition disputed claims. Effective May 6, 2011 all outstanding warrants expired and were cancelled, and no further warrants will be issued from the reserve to resolve remaining pre-petition disputed unsecured claims. To the extent this reserve is insufficient to satisfy these disputed claims, the Company would be required to issue additional shares of common stock, which would result in dilution to holders of its common stock. Under the claims reconciliation and allowance process set forth in the Plan, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, in consultation with the Company, established a reserve to provide for a pro rata distribution of common stock to holders of disputed claims as they become allowed. As claims are evaluated and processed, the Company will object to some claims or portions thereof, and upward adjustments (to the extent stock not previously distributed remain) or downward adjustments to the reserve will be made pending or following adjudication of these objections. Predictions regarding the allowance and classification of claims are inherently difficult to make. As general unsecured claims have been allowed in the Bankruptcy Court, the Company has distributed approximately one share of common stock of the Company per $383.00 in allowed claim amount. This rate was established based upon the assumption that the new common stock allocated to holders of general unsecured claims on the effective date, including the reserve established for disputed claims, would be fully distributed so that the recovery rates for all allowed unsecured claims would comply with the Plan without the need for any redistribution or supplemental issuance of securities. If the amount of general unsecured claims that is eventually allowed exceeds the amount of claims anticipated in the setting of the reserve, additional new common stock will be issued for the excess claim amounts at the same rates as used for the other general unsecured claims. If this were to occur, additional new common stock would also be issued to the holders of pre-petition secured claims to maintain the ratio of their distribution in common stock at nine times the amount of common stock distributed for all unsecured claims. 17 Table of Contents The Companys ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income. The Company recognizes the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when realization of the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit the Companys ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by its deferred tax assets. As of March 31, 2011, the Companys current and long-term deferred tax assets were $31.1 million and $81.0 million, respectively. Negative tax consequences could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of the Companys operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the Companys valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on the Companys statement of financial position that could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Additionally, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in other countries where the Company has significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Companys consolidated statement of financial position and tax expense. The Company is also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Company is appealing the results of a tax audit in Spain for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 that is related to current and certain former Spanish subsidiaries. In May 2011, the Company was notified that the Spanish tax authorities will begin an audit of its current and certain former Spanish subsidiaries for fiscal years 2007 through 2010. The Company anticipates that it will receive an assessment for matters similar to those under appeal, which may amount to $40.0 million. Although the Company would appeal this estimated assessment and attempt to enter into a delayed payment plan as it successfully accomplished with respect to the 2003 through 2006 assessment, negative results from one or more such tax audits could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The Company is subject to regulation of its international operations that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Due to the Companys global operations, it is subject to many laws governing international relations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where it can do business, what information or products it can supply to certain countries and what information it can provide to a non-U.S. government, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.S. Export Administration Act. Violations of these laws, which are complex and often times difficult to interpret and apply, may result in severe criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Any restructuring activities that the Company may undertake, including its recently announced alignment of its businesses on a regional basis, may not achieve the benefits anticipated and could result in additional unanticipated costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The Company regularly evaluates its existing operations, production capacity and business efficiencies and, as a result of such evaluations, the Company may undertake restructuring activities within its businesses, including the recently announced alignment of the Companys global businesses on a regional basis. These restructuring plans may involve higher costs or longer timetables than the Company anticipates and could result in substantial costs related to severance and other employee-related matters, litigation risks and 18 Table of Contents expenses, and other costs. These restructuring activities may not result in improvements in future financial performance. If the Company is unable to realize the benefits of any restructuring activities or appropriately structure its businesses to meet market conditions, the restructuring activities could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISION OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 Except for historical information, this report may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. The Company is including this cautionary statement for the express purpose of availing itself of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
