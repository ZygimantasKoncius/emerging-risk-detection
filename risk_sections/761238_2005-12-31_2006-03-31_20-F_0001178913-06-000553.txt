D. RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES. OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DUE TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS. IN THAT CASE, THE VALUE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES COULD DECLINE, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE. In the year ended December 31, 2005 we recorded a net loss of $2.3 million. We have incurred losses in three out of the last five years and as of December 31, 2005 our accumulated deficit was $59.3 million. We may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US. Our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by our operating activities are likely to vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of orders and deliveries, the build-up of inventories, and the payment terms offered to our customers. As a consequence of our significant losses, we incurred significant bank debt and sold equity and debt securities in private placements in the years 1997 through 2005. We may need to raise additional funds for a number of uses, including: 2 o Working capital and operating activities; o Implementing marketing and sales activities for our products; o Maintaining and expanding research and development programs; o Hiring additional qualified personnel; and o Supporting an increased level of operations. We may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some aspects of our operations and we may not be able to: o Develop new products; o Enhance our existing products; o Remain current with evolving industry standards; o Fulfill our contractual obligations; o Take advantage of future opportunities; o Respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements; or o Retain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. If adequate funds are not available to us, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Any equity or debt financings, if available at all, may cause dilution to our then-existing shareholders and may increase our financing expenses. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the net tangible book value per share of our ordinary shares would decrease and the percentage ownership of then current shareholders would be diluted. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. In line with our growth strategy, we have entered into teaming agreements and other co-operation agreements with Smiths Aerospace Electronic Systems, or Smiths, and Lockheed Martin Aerospace to increase our penetration into the aviation market. We are currently investing and intend to continue to invest significant resources to develop these relationships. Should our relationships fail to materialize into significant agreements or should we fail to work efficiently with such parties, we may lose sales and marketing opportunities and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 3 As part of our growth strategy, we seek to acquire or invest in complementary, including competitive, businesses, products and technologies. We acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities related to the operations of Vectop Ltd., or Vectop, in the first quarter of 2005, and are seeking additional potential acquisition candidates. We currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any future acquisitions or investments and we may not be able to consummate any acquisition or investment. Even if we do acquire or invest in these businesses, products or technology, the process of integrating acquired assets into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. In addition, we have limited experience in managing acquisitions and growth. Therefore, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized. Furthermore, future acquisitions by us could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position. Acquisitions also involve other risks, including risks inherent in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and the potential loss of key employees and the risk that we may experience difficulty or delays in obtaining necessary permits. COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT AND AVIONICS EQUIPMENT IS INTENSE AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. The market for our products is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively in our market. Our principal competitors in the automated test equipment market are Zaban in Israel, and Aerospatiale Avionique and Avtron abroad. Our principal competitors in the avionics market are Harris, Rockwell Collins, Honeywell, Elbit Systems Ltd., or Elbit, Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd., or IAI, R.S.L. Ltd., TEAC and Elisra Systems Ltd. We expect to continue to face competition from these and other competitors. Most, if not all, of our competitors are far larger, have substantially greater resources including financial, technological, marketing and distribution capabilities, and enjoy greater market recognition than we have. These competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to price competition than us. We may not be able to offer our products as part of integrated systems to the same extent as our competitors or successfully develop or introduce new products that are more cost effective or offer better performance than those of our competitors. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. OUR INITIATIVE OF PROVIDING MANUFACTURING SERVICES MAY NOT SUCCEED, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY IN OUR BEIT-SHE'AN PRODUCTION FACILITY AND MAY BE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN ITS OPERATIONS. In June 2000, we began to provide manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers in Israel and the United States, using the manufacturing capabilities of our Beit-She'an plant. The market for our manufacturing services is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively in this market. The cost of labor and the efficiency of the production equipment and production processes are crucial to our success in this market. Consequently, should we fail to maintain low labor costs, enhance our production equipment and develop new and more efficient production methods, we may have to shut down the operations of our Beit-She'an plant, which may harm our competitiveness and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 4 REDUCTION IN MILITARY BUDGETS WORLDWIDE MAY CAUSE A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of products with military applications. These revenues, on a consolidated basis, totaled approximately $11.8 million, or 88% of revenues in 2005, $11.8 million, or 83 % of revenues in 2004, and $9.6 million, or 78% of revenues in 2003. The military budgets of a number of countries may be reduced in the future. Declines in military budgets may result in reduced demand for our products and manufacturing services. This would result in reduction in our core business' revenues and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES; TERMINATION, REDUCTION OR MODIFICATION OF CONTRACTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL, OR A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN OUR CUSTOMERS' BUDGETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. Our military aviation products are sold primarily to government agencies and authorities and government-owned companies, many of which have complex and time-consuming procurement procedures. A long period of time often elapses from the time we begin marketing a product until we actually sell that product to a particular customer. In addition, our sales to government agencies, authorities and companies are directly affected by these customers' budgetary constraints and the priority given in their budgets to the procurement of our products. Further, our business with the State of Israel and other governmental entities is, in general, subject to delays in funding and performance of contracts and the termination of contracts or subcontracts for convenience, among others. The termination, reduction or modification of our contracts or subcontracts with the Government of Israel in the event of change in requirements, policies or budgetary constraints would have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE THE GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR THE EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE. SIMILARLY IF OUR SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR GOVERNMENT APPROVALS NECESSARY TO EXPORT THEIR PRODUCTS OR DESIGNS TO US, OUR REVENUES MIGHT DECREASE AND WE MAY FAIL TO IMPLEMENT OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. Under Israeli law, the export of certain of our products and know-how is subject to approval by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. To initiate sales proposals with regard to exports of our products and know-how and to export such products or know-how, we must obtain permits from the Ministry of Defense. We may not be able to receive in a timely manner all the required permits for which we may apply in the future. Similarly, under foreign laws the export of certain military products, technical designs and spare parts require the prior approval of, or export license from, such foreign governments. In order to maintain our third party production, certain co-development activities and procurements required for the performance of certain contracts, we must receive detailed technical designs, products or products' parts samples from our strategic partners or suppliers. We may not be able to receive all the required permits and/or licenses in a timely manner. Consequently, our revenues may decrease and we may fail to implement our growth strategy. 5 WE DEPEND ON SALES TO KEY CUSTOMERS AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUES. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers. Our major customers during the three years ended December 31, 2005 were as follows: PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES ------------------------ 2003 2004 2005 ---- ---- ---- Smiths Electronic Systems 22% 5% 21% The Boeing Company 14% 10% 3% Israeli Ministry of Defense 11% 19% 12% Israel Aviation Industries 12% 6% 14% Portuguese Air Force 19% 17% - U.S. Navy - 11% - Lockheed Martin 6% 5% 12% We anticipate that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be derived from sales to a small number of customers. If our principal customers do not continue to purchase products from us at current levels or if such customers are not retained and we are not able to derive sufficient revenues from sales to new customers to compensate for their loss, our revenues would be reduced and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THESE COMPONENTS WHEN NEEDED, WE WOULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We acquire most of the components for the manufacturing of our products from a limited number of suppliers and subcontractors, most of whom are located in Israel and the United States. Certain of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more components upon which we are dependent. Suppliers of some of the components for manufacturing require us to place orders with significant lead-time to assure supply in accordance with our manufacturing requirements. Inadequacy of operating funds may cause us to delays placement of such orders and may result in delays in supply. Delays in supply may significantly hurt our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations and may significantly hurt our business and result of operations. We may not be able to continue to obtain such components from these suppliers on satisfactory commercial terms. Temporary disruptions of our manufacturing operations would ensue if we were required to obtain components from alternative sources, which may have an adverse effect on our financial results. WE RELY ON THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND THE CONTINUED FINANCIAL CRISES IN THIS INDUSTRY ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SALES. The airline industry is an important market for our automated test equipment products and product support services. Our ability to achieve growth and profitability in this market depends in great measure on the economic condition of the commercial aviation industry. Since 2001, and especially following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the airline industry has suffered from economic decline that caused the bankruptcy of several airlines and imposed financial constraints on the entire industry. As a result of these conditions, the sales of our automated test equipment products have materially decreased. The continuance of the crisis in the commercial aviation industry will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 6 RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. The avionics market in which we compete is subject to technological changes, introduction of new products, change in customer demands and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with technological developments and to timely address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and new technologies and by developing and introducing enhancements to our current products and new products. We may not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our products that will respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or customer requirements. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of such enhancements, and such enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the market and may not achieve any significant degrees of market acceptance. If release dates of our new products or enhancements are delayed or, if when released, they fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SALES. While our principal executive offices are located in Israel, exports accounted for 59% of our sales in 2005, 65% of our sales in 2004 and 74% of our sales in 2003. This subjects us to many risks inherent in engaging in export international business, including: o Limitations and disruptions resulting from the imposition of government controls; o Changes in regulatory requirements; o Export license requirements; o Economic or political instability; o Trade restrictions; o Changes in tariffs; o Currency fluctuations; o Longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; 7 o Greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property; o Difficulties in managing overseas subsidiaries and international operations; and o Potential adverse tax consequences. We may not be able to sustain or increase revenues from international operations and may encounter significant difficulties in connection with the sale of our products in international markets. Any of those events will have a material adverse affect on our business, operating results and financial condition. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE WORLD MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While our revenues are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our expenses is incurred in NIS. We do not currently engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations. If we were to determine that it was in our best interests to enter into any hedging transactions in the future, we may not be able to do so. Furthermore, such transactions, if entered into, may not materially reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations. In addition, if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies into NIS were imposed, our business could be adversely affected. In the future, such fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on revenues from international sales, operating expenses and consequently, on our business, operating results and financial condition. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL, IN PARTICULAR HERZLE BODINGER, OUR PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, WHOSE LOSS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our future success depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and key personnel. In particular, we are dependent on the services of Herzle Bodinger, our chairman and president. We do not carry key person life insurance on our senior management or key personnel. Any loss of the services of Herzle Bodinger, other members of senior management or other key personnel could negatively and materially effect our business. OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY IS DIFFICULT TO PROTECT AND UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY BY THIRD PARTIES MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. Our success and ability to compete largely depends upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright law and confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-inventions agreements to protect our proprietary technology. Except for a patent that relates to our ACE(TM) system, we do not have any patents. 8 OUR PRODUCTS MAY INFRINGE ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us or claims that we have violated a patent or infringed on a copyright, trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them. In addition, any infringement claim, even one without merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources to defend. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING THE TRANSFER OF THE TITLE TO THE LAND AND BUILDING OF OUR CHINESE SUBSIDIARY. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH TITLE AND BE REQUIRED TO INITIATE LITIGATION IN ORDER TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS TO RECEIVE TITLE TO SUCH PROPERTIES. Beijing Huarui Aircraft Components Maintenance and Services Co., Ltd. or CACS, our Chinese subsidiary, conducts its business in an approximately 16,000 square foot facility in Beijing that includes offices and test and repair facilities. The land for this facility was leased by Beijing Tianzu Forestry Company or Tianzu, the minority shareholder in CACS, from the Chinese government for 30 years. Under a joint venture agreement, and in consideration for its equity investment in CACS, Tianzu granted CACS usage rights in the land, constructed the building and granted CACS the ownership of this building. We are currently in the process of completing the transfer of the title to the land and building. Although Tianzu is legally obligated to complete such transfer of title to the land and the building, such transfer may take additional time and may not be completed, and we may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce our rights to receive title to the land and building. COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. As a result of certain corporate governance scandals and the legislative and litigation environment resulting from those scandals, the costs of being a public company in general have increased in recent years. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices. We expect that the on-going implementation of these regulations will further increase our legal compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result of such developments. If we are required to implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which governs internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, we will need to expend significant management time and financial resources to comply with the applicable requirements. This and other proposed legislation may increase the fees of our professional advisors and our insurance premiums. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR ORDINARY SHARES OUR SHARE PRICE HAS BEEN VOLATILE IN THE PAST AND MAY DECLINE IN THE FUTURE. Our ordinary shares have experienced significant market price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant market price and volume fluctuations in the future in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control: 9 o Quarterly variations in our operating results; o Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; o Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; o Announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; o Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; o Changes in the status of our intellectual property rights; o Announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us; o Additions or departures of key personnel; o Future sales of our ordinary shares; o De-listing of our shares from the NASDAQ Capital Market; and o Stock market price and volume fluctuations. Domestic and international stock markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events or hostilities in or surrounding Israel, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. SUBSTANTIAL FUTURE SALES OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES MAY DEPRESS OUR SHARE PRICE. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ordinary shares, including shares registered under effective registration statements and shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, or convertible notes, or if the perception exists that our shareholders may sell a substantial number of our ordinary shares, the market price of our ordinary shares may fall. Any substantial sales of our shares in the public market also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time, in a place and on terms we deem appropriate. 10 WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our ordinary shares and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our ordinary shares, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our ordinary shares will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your ordinary shares. RISKS RELATING TO OUR LOCATION IN ISRAEL CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN ISRAEL ENTAILS SPECIAL RISKS. We are incorporated under the laws of, and our executive offices, manufacturing plant and research and development facilities are located in, the State of Israel. Although a large portion of our sales are made to customers outside Israel, we are nonetheless directly affected by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Specifically, we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving Israel, a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the Israeli army, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since September 2000, there has been a marked increase in violence, civil unrest and hostility, including armed clashes, between the State of Israel and the Palestinians, and acts of terror have been committed inside Israel and against Israeli targets in the West Bank and Gaza. In August 2005, Israel evacuated all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the West Bank. In January 2006, Hamas won the elections in the Palestinian Authority and on March 28, 2006, elections to the Israeli parliament were held in Israel. The implications of these developments cannot at this time be foreseen. There is no indication as to how long the current hostilities will last or whether there will be any further escalation. Any continuation of, or further escalation in, these hostilities or any future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region may have a negative effect on our business condition, harm our results of operations and adversely affect our share price. 11 Furthermore, there are a number of countries that restrict business with Israel or Israeli companies. Restrictive laws or policies of those countries directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses had, and may in the future continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, our financial results or the expansion of our business. No predictions can be made as to whether or when a final resolution of the area's problems will be achieved or the nature thereof and to what extent the situation will impact Israel's economic development or our operations. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE OBLIGATION OF OUR PERSONNEL TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. Many of our executive officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or a significant number of other employees due to military service. Any disruption in our operations could adversely affect our business. THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL HAVE NOT BEEN STABLE IN RECENT YEARS. In recent years Israel has been going through a period of recession in economic activity, resulting in low growth rates and growing unemployment. Although economic activity in Israel has improved recently, our operations could be adversely affected if the economic conditions in Israel begin to deteriorate once again. WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE RATE OF INFLATION IN ISRAEL EXCEEDS THE RATE OF DEVALUATION OF THE NIS AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. In 2005 approximately 38% of our expenses were in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar-linked NIS, in 2004 approximately 34% of our expenses were in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar-linked NIS and in 2003 approximately 25% of our expenses were in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar-linked NIS. In each of these years, virtually all our remaining expenses were in unlinked NIS. Our expenses that are denominated in U.S. dollars or paid in Israeli currency linked to the U.S. dollar-NIS exchange rate are influenced by the extent to which any inflation in Israel is not offset (or is offset on a lagging basis) by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2002, the rate of devaluation of the NIS against the dollar exceeded the rate of inflation in Israel, which benefited us. In 2003, the rate of inflation was negative and the NIS was revaluated vis-a-vis the dollar. In 2004 and 2005, the rate of inflation was 1.2% and 2.4% respectively, and the NIS was reevaluated vis-a-vis the dollar. These changes, as well as the recent world-wide devaluation of the U.S. dollar, have affected our operations, financial condition and results of operations by decreasing the NIS equivalents of our U.S. denominated revenues and increasing the U.S. dollar equivalents of our NIS denominated expenses. We may be adversely affected in the future if the rate of inflation in Israel exceeds the devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar or if the timing of this devaluation lags behind increases in inflation in Israel. 12 SERVICE AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROCESS ON US AND OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. Service of process upon our directors and officers and the Israeli experts named herein, most of whom reside outside the United States, may be difficult to obtain within the United States. Furthermore, since substantially all of our assets, most of our directors and officers and the Israeli experts named in this annual report are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against us or these individuals or entities may not be collectible within the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in original actions instituted in Israel. However, subject to certain time limitations and other conditions, Israeli courts may enforce final judgments of United States courts for liquidated amounts in civil matters, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of those Acts. PROVISIONS OF ISRAELI LAW MAY DELAY, PREVENT OR MAKE THE ACQUISITION OF OUR COMPANY DIFFICULT, WHICH COULD PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL AND THEREFORE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES. Provisions of Israeli corporate and tax law may have the effect of delaying, preventing or making more difficult a merger with, or other acquisition of, us. This could cause our ordinary shares to trade at prices below the price for which third parties might be willing to pay to gain control of us. Third parties who are otherwise willing to pay a premium over prevailing market prices to gain control of us may be unable or unwilling to do so because of these provisions of Israeli law. YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A SHAREHOLDER WILL BE GOVERNED BY ISRAELI LAW AND DIFFER IN SOME RESPECTS FROM THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF SHAREHOLDERS UNDER U.S. LAW. We are incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our memorandum of association, our articles of association and by Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these duties are applicable in shareholder votes on, among other things, amendments to a company's articles of association, increases in a company's authorized share capital, mergers and interested party transactions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or executive officer in the company has a duty of fairness toward the company. However, Israeli law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. Because Israeli corporate law has undergone extensive revision in recent years, there is little case law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior. 13 AS A FOREIGN PRIVATE ISSUER WHOSE SHARES ARE LISTED ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, WE MAY FOLLOW CERTAIN HOME COUNTRY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES INSTEAD OF CERTAIN NASDAQ REQUIREMENTS. As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, including the composition of our board of directors, director nomination procedure, compensation of officers and quorum at shareholders meetings. In addition, we may follow Israeli law instead of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules that require that we obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of our company, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 19.9% or more interest in our company and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company.
