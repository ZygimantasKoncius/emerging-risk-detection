Risk Factors Actual or perceived health risks or other problems relating to mobile handsets or transmission masts could lead to litigation or decreased mobile communications usage. The effects of, and any damage caused by, exposure to an electromagnetic field were and are the subject of careful evaluations by the international scientific community, but until now there is no scientific evidence of harmful effects on health. We cannot rule out that exposure to electromagnetic fields or other emissions originating from wireless handsets will not be identified as a health risk in the future. Our mobile communications business may be harmed as a result of these alleged health risks. For example, the perception of these health risks could result in a lower number of customers, reduced usage per customer or potential consumer liability. In addition, although Italian law already imposes strict limits in relation to transmission equipment, these concerns may cause regulators to impose greater restrictions on the construction of base station towers or other infrastructure, which may hinder the completion of network build-outs and the commercial availability of new services and may require additional investments. 17 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Exchange Rates 3.2 EXCHANGE RATES We publish our consolidated financial statements in euros. References to , euro and Euro are to the euro, the single unified currency that was introduced in Italy and 10 other member states of the EU on January 1, 1999. References to U.S. dollars, dollars, U.S.$ or $ are to U.S. dollars, the currency of the United States of America.

As a result and in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), during the fourth quarter of 2013, the SoforaTelecom Argentina group was treated as Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale. As a result of such treatment, prior years have been restated. (**) Starting from 2012, the Telecom Italia Group early adopted and retrospectively applied revised IAS 19 (Employee Benefits); therefore, the comparative figures for 2011 and 2010 were restated on a consistent basis. The adoption of IAS 19 did not have any effect on the Groups statement of financial position other than for certain reclassifications under Equity. 2009 data was not restated for the adoption of IAS 19 as the company considered the impact immaterial. (1) For the convenience of the reader, Euro amounts for 2013 have been converted into U.S. dollars using the Euro/Dollar Exchange Rate in effect on December 31, 2013, of 1.00 =1.3779 U.S.$. (2) For the purposes of IFRS, Parent, as used in this Annual Report, means Telecom Italia S.p.A. 21 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Selected Financial And Statistical Information (3) Due to the loss in 2012 and in 2011, the ratio coverage was less than 1:1. The company would have needed to generate additional earnings of 339 million euros in 2012 and 3,226 million euros in 2011 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges: · Earnings is calculated by adding:  profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations;  fixed charges (as defined below);  amortization of capitalized interest and debt issue discounts or premiums;  dividends from associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method; and  share of losses of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method and then subtracting:  capitalized interest for the applicable period; and  share of earnings of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. · Fixed charges is calculated by adding:  interest expenses (both expensed and capitalized);  issue costs and any original debt issue discounts or premiums; and  an estimate of the interest within rental expense for operating leases. This component is estimated to equal 1/3 of rental expense, which is considered a reasonable approximation of the interest factor. The calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges excludes discontinued operations. However the impact on the ratio from the inclusion of the interest expenses related to discontinued operations would be immaterial. (4) In accordance with IAS 33 (Earnings per share), basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the Groups profit (loss) available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, including the Telecom Italia shares related to the Mandatory Convertible Bonds issued by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. in November 2013 and excluding treasury shares. Since Telecom Italia has both Ordinary and Savings Shares outstanding, the calculations also take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of 0.55 euros per share above dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of:  Ordinary Shares was 13,571,392,501 for the year ended December 31, 2013 (such number includes also the ordinary shares expected to be issued by Telecom Italia upon the conversion of the mandatory convertible bonds issued by Telecom Italia Finance S.A.), 13,277,621,082 for the year ended December 31, 2012, 13,264,375,078 for the year ended December 31, 2011, 13,239,883,276 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 13,220,792,908 for the year ended December 31, 2009;  Savings Shares was 6,026,120,661 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009. For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of all dilutive potential shares. Potential shares are those securities that, if converted into shares, would increase the total number of shares outstanding and reduce the earnings attributable to each share. Potential shares include options, warrants and convertible securities. The Groups profit (loss) is also adjusted to reflect the impact of the conversion of potential shares net of the related tax effects. (5) Subject to approval, at the Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on April 16, 2014, Telecom Italias dividend coupons for its Savings Shares for the year ended December 31, 2013, will be clipped on April 22, 2014, and will be payable from April 25, 2014. (6) Share capital represents share capital issued net of the accounting par value of treasury shares; accounting par value is the ratio of total share capital and the number of issued shares. (7) Net Financial Debt is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act. For further details please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects5.2 Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 20135.2.3 Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (8) Physical accesses include Broadband accesses. 22 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends 3.4 DIVIDENDS The determination of our future dividend policy, and the amounts thereof, will depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to our earnings, financial condition and cash requirements, prospects and such other factors as may be deemed relevant at the time. The following table sets forth the dividends per Ordinary Share and per Savings Share declared by Telecom Italia with respect to each of the last five fiscal years and the aggregate dividends paid in such years. Actual dividends paid are rounded to the nearest whole cent. No ordinary share dividend is being paid for the year ended December 31, 2013.

(2) Subject to approval at the Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on April 16, 2014. Telecom Italias dividend coupons for its Savings Shares for the year ended December 31, 2013, will be clipped on April 22, 2014, and will be payable from April 25, 2014. Payment of annual dividends is subject to approval by the holders of Ordinary Shares at the annual general shareholders meeting, which must be held within 180 days after the end of the financial year to which it relates (pursuant to article 18, second paragraph, of the Companys Bylaws). In addition, Article 21 of the Companys Bylaws gives the Board of Directors the power to approve the distribution of interim dividends. Pursuant to Italian law, the distribution may be approved after the final approval of the preceding years financial statements, and the interim dividends may not exceed the lower of (i) the difference between profits from the preceding fiscal year and amounts required to be attributed to legal and statutory reserves and (ii) available reserves. Once paid in compliance with applicable laws, shareholders cannot be required to repay interim dividends to the Company if the shareholders collected such dividends in good faith. Dividends not collected within five years from the date they become payable will be forfeited in favor of the Company. If profits are not fully distributed, additional reserves are created. According to the Italian Civil Code, before dividends may be paid with respect to any year, an amount equal to 5% of the profit of the Company for such year must be set aside to the legal reserve until the legal reserve, including amounts set aside during prior years, is at least equal to one-fifth of the par value of the Companys issued share capital. This legal reserve is not available for payment of dividends. Such restriction on the payment of dividends applies, on a non-consolidated basis, to each Italian subsidiary of the Telecom Italia Group. The Company may also pay dividends out of available retained earnings from prior years or other reserves. Dividends in respect of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares held with Monte Titoli S.p.A. (Monte Titoli) are automatically credited to the accounts of the beneficial owners with the relevant participant of Monte Titoli, without the need for presentation by such beneficial owners of any documentation. See Item 10. Additional Information10.4 Description of Capital Stock. Arrangements between Euroclear or Clearstream and Monte Titoli permit the shareholders to collect the dividends through Euroclear or Clearstream. Holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are entitled to receive payments in respect of dividends on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with the relevant Deposit Agreement. Dividends payable on the Companys Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares may be subject to deduction of Italian withholding tax. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. Italian regulations do not contain any specific restrictions on the payment of dividends to non-residents of Italy. See Item 10. Additional Information10.2 Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Security Holders. 23 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends Pursuant to Italian law, in connection with the payment of dividends, participants of Monte Titoli are required to supply to the Italian tax authorities certain information concerning the identity of non-resident shareholders holding Ordinary Shares or Savings Shares. Shareholders are required to provide their Italian tax identification number, if any, or alternatively, in the case of legal entities, their name, country of establishment and address, or in the case of individuals, their name, address and place and date of birth, or in the case of partnerships, the information required for legal entities and the information required for individuals with respect to one of their representatives. In the case of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs owned by non-residents in Italy, Telecom Italia understands that the provision of information concerning the Depositary, in its capacity as holder of record of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, will satisfy these requirements. The Depositary, in accordance with instructions from Telecom Italia, will provide information to beneficial owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs, that are considered U.S. residents for purposes of applicable law. To the extent such owners wish to benefit from reduced withholding tax rates on dividends under an income tax treaty, claims for such benefits must be accompanied by the required information. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. 24 Table of Contents
