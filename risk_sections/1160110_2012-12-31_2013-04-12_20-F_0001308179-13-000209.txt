RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risk factors described below in addition to the other information presented in this document. Risks Relating to the Environment in Which We Conduct Our Operations We May Fail to Maintain or Increase Our Competitiveness and Adapt Our Business Model to Rapid Changes in Environment-Related Businesses. Our business is highly competitive and requires substantial human and capital resources and cutting-edge technical expertise in numerous areas. Large international competitors, local niche companies and companies whose structural costs or profitability requirements are lower than ours (in particular public sector operators such as mixed public-private companies in France and Stadtwerke in Germany) serve each of the markets in which we compete. Accordingly, we must constantly strive to reduce our cost structure to remain competitive and convince potential customers of the quality and value of our services. Otherwise, we may suffer the loss of existing contracts or a substantial fall in profitability on contract renewals or no longer have access to new contracts. We may also need to develop new technologies and services or decrease our overhead in order to maintain or increase our competitive position, which could result in significant costs. In addition, our contracts may not be renewed at the end of their term, which, in the case of major contracts, may require us to implement costly reorganization measures. When the contract does not provide for the transfer of the related assets and employees to the succeeding operator and/or appropriate compensation to cover our costs of termination, the impact on our results could be substantial. Public authorities may also increasingly seek to assume direct management of water or waste services (particularly under management contracts), increasing the risk of non-renewal. Even when we are able to renew our contracts, the new terms may be less favorable than the prior terms. Moreover, certain contracts provide for periodic renegotiation of terms, and we may face pressure to agree to less favorable terms upon renegotiation. Our Cost Savings and Transformation Plans May Fail to Generate the Expected Cost Savings. We have set cost reduction targets under two plans, but we may not be able to realize the savings objectives in these plans. In 2003, we began our cost-saving Efficiency Plan, which we continue to implement. In 2011, we began to implement the new Convergence Plan, which is part of the transformation of our organization, aimed at standardizing processes, reinforcing the control and steering of operations and streamlining our structure. Key features of these plans are described under Item 4. Information on the Company  Our Overall Strategy. These plans could take longer to implement than expected and, with respect to the Convergence Plan, require more costs than planned. In addition, our cost reduction measures are based on current conditions and do not take into account future cost increases that could result from changes in our industry or operations, including new business developments, wage and price increases or other factors. Restructuring and disposals may harm our labor relations and public relations and could lead to disruptions. Our failure to successfully implement these plans, or the possibility that these efforts may not generate the level of cost savings we expect going forward or may result in higher than expected costs, could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. We May Not Be Able to Realize All of the Divestments That We Are Hoping to Make. If We Do, the Proceeds May Be Lower Than We Currently Expect. At the end of 2011, we announced a divestment program to refocus our activities and reduce our net debt, under which we seek to sell €5 billion of assets over 2012 and 2013. In particular, we announced plans to withdraw progressively from Veolia Transdev, to sell our rate-regulated Water activities in the United Kingdom, to divest our solid waste activities in the United States, and to continue to streamline our geographical coverage. While we made significant divestitures in 2012, including our regulated U.K. Water activities and our U.S. solid waste activities, we need to make further divestures in 2013 to achieve our objective. -5- Table of Contents Divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions, potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses or the failure to complete the divestiture at all. The conditions under which the activities sold are carved out expose us to risks relating to the need to set up independent functional services in each activity, when those services were previously provided on a shared basis. We may also lose valuable resources (including the training campus) and significant expertise with respect to financial services, human resources, real estate and general services. In addition, the merger agreements involved in such sales include vendor warranties covering certain risks identified by the buyer. If such risks materialize, the resulting warranty calls could have negative financial consequences on us. We Have Conducted and May Continue to Conduct External Growth Transactions Through Acquisitions and/or Mergers, Which Could Have a Less Favorable Impact on Our Activities and Results Than Anticipated, or Which Could Affect Our Financial Condition. We have conducted and may continue to carry out external growth transactions, in varying legal forms, in particular through acquisitions of businesses or companies or through mergers, and of varying sizes, some of which may be significant at the Group level. These external growth transactions involve numerous risks, including the following: (i) the assumptions underlying the business plans supporting the valuations may prove inaccurate, in particular with respect to synergies and expected commercial demand; (ii) we may fail to successfully integrate the companies acquired and their technologies, products and personnel; (iii) we may fail to retain key employees, customers and suppliers of the companies acquired or merged; (iv) we may be required or wish to terminate pre-existing contractual relationships, which could prove costly and/or be performed at unfavorable terms and conditions; (v) we may increase our indebtedness to finance these acquisitions or mergers; and (vi) we may be forced to carve-out or divest or limit the growth of certain businesses in order to obtain the necessary authorizations, in particular with respect to antitrust authorizations. As a result, the expected benefits of completed or future acquisitions, mergers or other external growth transactions may not materialize within the time periods or to the extent anticipated, or may impact our financial condition. Currency Exchange and Interest Rate Fluctuations May Negatively Affect Our Financial Results and the Price of Our Shares. We hold assets, earn income and incur expenses and liabilities in a variety of currencies. Our financial statements are presented in euros. Accordingly, when we prepare our financial statements, we must translate our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, income and expense items into euros at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro against these other currencies can affect the value of these items in the financial statements, even if their intrinsic value is unchanged in the original currency. For example, an increase in the value of the euro may result in a decrease in the reported value, in euros, of our investments held in foreign currencies. We are also subject to risks related to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2012, our gross financial debt equaled €16,831.2 million before hedging, of which 34% bore interest at floating rates and 66% was fixed rate debt, after taking into account hedging instruments and fair value remeasurement of fixed-rate debt (see Note 27.1.1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 18 in this annual report on Form 20-F). Fluctuations in interest rates may affect our future growth and investment strategy since a rise in interest rates may force us to finance acquisitions or investments or refinance existing debt at a higher cost in the future. Our Business is Subject to Greenhouse Gas Market and Emission Allowance Risks. As an operator of energy installations, we are exposed to the inherent risks of the greenhouse gas allowance system introduced by the European Union in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. The rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere led certain States and the international community to introduce regulatory provisions. Phase 3 of the National Allowance Allocation Plans, which runs from 2013 to 2020, is targeted reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels). As a consequence, some of the allowances needed after January 1, 2013 by our Group (Dalkia) will have to be purchased (through an auction system), which is expected to generate additional costs. In this context, our risk is two-fold: first, we may not be able to achieve the emission reductions imposed by the system over a number of years, which would result in our Group being required to purchase additional greenhouse gas allowances. Second, we may not be able to adjust our pricing policy so as to pass on the extra cost of purchasing these allowances in the future. -6- Table of Contents Our Business Operations In Some Countries May Be Subject to Political Risks. Sales outside of France generated 59% of total Group revenue in 2012. While our operations are concentrated mainly in Europe, the United States, China and Australia, we conduct business in markets around the world. We also conduct business in certain emerging countries. In a complex and sometimes unstable international environment, risks relating to conducting business in certain countries can affect our financial position, results of operations, reputation and outlook. In particular, given the nature of our activities and the term of our contracts, our results can partially depend on external operating conditions, including the geopolitical, economic, social or financial situation or the level of development, working conditions and environmental conditions of a given country. The risks associated with conducting business in some countries can include the non-payment or slower payment of invoices, which is sometimes aggravated by the absence of legal recourse for non-payment, nationalization, increased foreign exchange risk and currency restrictions on fund repatriation. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing for our operations in these countries. The setting of public utility fees and their structure may depend on political decisions that can impede any increase in fees for several years, such that fees no longer cover service costs or provide appropriate compensation for a private operator. Major amendments to or the uneven application of regulations, social unrest, local authority claims challenging the tax system or the application of contractual terms, foreign exchange control measures and other negative actions or restrictions imposed by governments can also significantly affect operating conditions, particularly in emerging countries. The economic balance of our contracts may deteriorate as a result of changes in local economic, social or environmental conditions, such as an increase in unpaid household debts or a reduction in available environmental resources, like water or biomass. We may not be able to insure or hedge against these risks. Furthermore, we may find we are unable to defend our rights before a court of law in certain emerging countries should we come into conflict with their governments or other local public entities. Unfavorable events or circumstances in certain countries may lead us to record exceptional provisions and/or impairments, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results and outlook. The Destabilization of a Country May Generate Emergency Situations and Exceptional Risks. In certain cases, a combination of factors could lead to the general political and economic destabilization of a country in which we operate and even make it difficult for us to conduct business because of reduced security and stability. The risk of nationalization or expropriation of private assets may also be higher for companies of foreign origin. Given the nature of our activities and our geographical reach, our tangible and intangible property, employees, security and information systems could be the target of malicious attacks or terrorist acts. In the areas of public transportation, energy services and waste management, our installations and vehicles around the world may become targets. For example, the distribution of drinking water is an activity of vital importance and a major public health consideration that could be targeted by criminal action. As a result, despite the preventive and safety measures implemented by us and the insurance policies subscribed, a criminal or terrorist attack could negatively affect our reputation or operating results. In addition, our employees work and travel in countries where the risk of criminal acts, kidnapping or terrorism is either temporarily or permanently high. The protection of our employees, activities and resources is subject to extremely stringent regulatory constraints, which expose us to legal liability. In addition, very large-scale or repetitive natural disasters may also lead to the exceptional disorganization of certain infrastructure (such as roads and means of communication) on which we depend for the conduct of our business or may cause damage to the infrastructure for which we are responsible. We could thus temporarily be unable to perform services according to the conditions defined by contract. -7- Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Operations Changes in the Prices of Energy and Other Commodities Or In the Price of Recycled Materials May Reduce Our Profits. The prices of energy and other commodities can be subject to significant fluctuations and represent major operating expenses of our businesses (particularly diesel fuel, gas and electricity). Although most of our contracts include price adjustment provisions that are intended to pass on any changes in the price of our supplies, often using price indexing formulas, certain events may prevent us from being fully protected against such increases, such as time lags between fuel price increases and the moment when we are authorized to increase prices to cover the additional costs or a mismatch between the price-increase formula and the cost structure (including taxes). A sustained increase in supply costs and/or related taxes could undermine our operations by increasing costs and reducing profitability, to the extent that we are unable to increase our prices sufficiently to cover such additional costs. In addition, a substantial portion of our Environmental Services divisions revenue is generated by its sorting-recycling and trading businesses, which are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the price of recycled raw materials (paper and ferrous and non-ferrous metal). A significant and long-term drop in the price of recycled raw materials, combined with the impact of economic conditions on volumes, has affected, and could continue to affect, our operating results. Our activities also include the production of electricity, particularly in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Central Europe. A significant portion of these sales concern so-called unavoidable production, co-generated with heat or resulting from the incineration of waste. In the initial years of service of an installation, the electricity produced is generally covered by guaranteed purchase tariffs pursuant to specific domestic regulations. At the end of this guaranteed tariff period, production is sold on the wholesale market and is exposed to fluctuations in the price of electricity. A significant and long-term drop in the market price of electricity in the countries concerned could, therefore, impact our operating results. Our Business is Affected By Variations in Weather Conditions. Varying weather conditions can have an impact on our results of operations. For example, Dalkia generates the bulk of its operating results in the first and fourth quarters of the year, corresponding to periods in which heating is used in Europe, while in the water sector, household water consumption tends to be highest between May and September in the northern hemisphere. Accordingly, these two businesses and therefore our results of operations may be affected by significant deviations from seasonal weather patterns. Our Long-Term Contracts May Limit Our Capacity To Quickly and Effectively React To General Economic Changes. We conduct the majority of our operations through long-term contracts, which can hinder our ability to react rapidly and appropriately to negative financial events. Over time, the circumstances or conditions under which we initially entered into a contract may change, which may result in adverse economic consequences. Such changes may vary in nature and foreseeability. Certain contractual mechanisms may help in addressing such changes and restoring the initial balance of the contract, but they may also not be fully effective. The implementation of such mechanisms may be triggered more or less automatically by the occurrence of a given event (for instance, price indexing clauses), or they may call for a procedure to revise or amend the contract with the agreement of both parties or of a third party. Accordingly, we may not be free to adapt our compensation in line with changes in our costs and demand, whether this consists of a price paid by the customer or a fee levied on end users based on an agreed-upon scale. These constraints are exacerbated by the long-term nature of contracts. In all cases, particularly in public service management contracts, our actions must remain within the scope of the contract and we are required to maintain uninterrupted service. We cannot suddenly and unilaterally terminate a business that we believe is unprofitable, or change its features, except in the face of proven customer misconduct and then only under certain circumstances. Certain of Our Operations are Performed Under Contracts Containing Performance Objectives That We Must Fulfill in Order to Be Compensated Or the Non-Fulfillment Of Which Would Result In the Imposition of Penalties. Through Veolia Water Solutions & Technologies, we perform turnkey contracts for the design and construction of infrastructure in the water sector, compensated at non-adjustable fixed prices. Our compensation is often subject to the fulfillment of certain performance objectives, the non-fulfillment of which results in imposition of penalties. -8- Table of Contents The risks to which we are exposed under these types of contracts are generally technical (design and choice of tailored versus tried-and-tested technology), operational (site management during performance, acceptance and warranty phases, ability to use a technology, that may be imposed by the customer) and economic (fluctuations in raw material prices, other supply prices or foreign exchange rates). In accordance with standard practice, to the extent possible we seek to cover these risks contractually. We may, however, encounter difficulties over which we have no control, relating, for example, to the complexity of certain infrastructure, weather or economic variations, construction contingencies, the purchase and ordering of equipment and supplies, or changes in performance schedules. In certain cases, we must rely on existing information or studies provided by the customer that may prove inaccurate or inconsistent, or we may be required to use existing infrastructure with poorly-adapted operating characteristics. These may lead to non-compliance with contract specifications or generate additional costs and construction delays, triggering, in certain cases, reductions in our revenue or contractual penalties, which could negatively affect our financial position, results or outlook. In certain cases, we must take into consideration public or private customer requests for additional work, whether or not such changes were provided for contractually. These changes may result in changes in the services provided, necessary investments or the invoicing method. While contracts generally include clauses providing for the payment of additional compensation should additional work be requested or should events such as those detailed above occur, we are nonetheless exposed to the risk of not obtaining sufficient payment to cover additional costs, as well as the risk of obtaining such amounts only after the passage of time. In addition, the failure of the sub-contractors and suppliers that we use in the performance of our contracts could generate delays and significant additional costs without the ability to recover all costs incurred. The Rights of Governmental Authorities to Terminate or Modify Our Contracts Unilaterally Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Revenue and Profits. Contracts with public authorities make up a significant percentage of our revenue. In numerous countries, including France, public authorities may unilaterally amend or terminate contracts under certain circumstances. While we often are entitled to compensation, this may not be true in all cases, and even when compensation is due, we may not be able to obtain full or timely compensation should a contract be unilaterally terminated by the relevant public authority. We May Make Significant Investments in Projects Without Being Able to Obtain the Required Approvals For the Project. To engage in business, in most cases we must sign a contract and sometimes obtain, or renew, various permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities. The competition and/or negotiation process that must be followed in order to win such contracts is often long, costly, complex and hard to predict. The same applies to the authorization process for activities that may harm the environment, which are often preceded by increasingly complex studies and public investigations. We may invest significant resources in a project or public tender without obtaining the right to perform the planned activity or sufficient compensation to cover the cost of our investment. This could arise due to failure to obtain necessary permits or authorizations, or approval from antitrust authorities, or because authorizations are granted contingent on our abandoning certain of our development projects. This result increases the overall cost of our activities and could potentially, were the cost of failure to become too high, force us to abandon certain projects. Should such situations become more frequent, the scope and profitability of our business could be affected. We Incur Significant Costs of Compliance With Various Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and other expenditures to comply with our environmental, health and safety obligations as well as in sanitary risk management, in particular with respect to water emissions, drinking water quality, waste processing, soil and ground water contamination, the quality of smoke emissions and gas emissions. We are continuously required to incur expenditures to ensure that the installations that we operate comply with applicable legal, regulatory and administrative requirements, including specific precautionary and preventative measures, or to advise our customers so that they undertake the necessary compliance work themselves. Failure by the client to meet its compliance obligations could be prejudicial to us as operator and adversely affect our reputation and growth capacity. Furthermore, regulatory bodies have the power to launch proceedings which could lead to the suspension or cancellation of permits or authorizations held by us or injunctions to suspend or cease certain activities. These measures may be accompanied by fines and civil or criminal sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our reputation, activities, financial position, results or outlook. If we are unable to recover this expenditure through higher prices, this could adversely affect our operations and profitability. -9- Table of Contents Each of our businesses, moreover, may become subject to stricter general or specific laws and regulations, and correspondingly incur greater compliance expenditures in the future. Moreover, the scope of application of environmental, health, safety and other laws and regulations is increasing constantly. As environmental laws and regulations are constantly being amended and tightened, these amendments can require significant compliance expenditures or investments that we may not be able to foresee. Our Operations and Activities May Cause Damage or Lead Us to Incur Liability That We Might be Required to Compensate or Repair. Increasingly broad laws and regulations expose us to greater risks of liability, in particular environmental liability, including in connection with assets that we no longer own and activities that have been discontinued. In addition, we may be required to pay fines, repair damage or undertake improvement work, even when we have conducted our activities with all due care and in full compliance with operating permits. In addition, due to lack of scientific data or studies, we may not be aware of risks to human health or the environment caused by our operations that may be identified in the future. We could be the subject of legal action to compensate damage caused to individuals, property or the environment (including the ecosystem). While our policy is to limit our liability contractually, implement prevention and protection measures and take out insurance policies covering our main accident and operational risks, these precautions may be insufficient, leaving us exposed to significant liability. In addition, our subsidiaries in France or abroad may, under environmental services outsourcing contracts, perform activities at certain environmentally sensitive sites known as high threshold Seveso sites (classified AS under the French Installations Classified for the Protection of the Environment (ICPE) system) or low threshold Seveso sites (or the foreign equivalent), operated by industrial customers (particularly petrochemical or chemical industry sites). With respect to such sites, we must manage the provision of services with even greater care, given the more dangerous nature of the products, waste, effluents and emissions to be treated, as well as the close proximity of installations managed by us to customer sites. The regulatory regime governing Seveso facilities applies only within the European Union, but we operate several similar sites outside of the European Union that are often subject to the same level of stringent regulation. Our Business Operations May Subject Our Employees to Health and Safety Risks. Our business operations require significant human resources. The intensity, nature and location of the work required, including on public roads and on customer sites, makes maintaining our employees safety particularly important. Despite our specific attention to the health and safety of our employees, which may require us to incur significant costs, we may nonetheless face increased work accidents and illness (both in frequency and severity). Human Resources Management Issues and Industrial Disputes Could Have a Negative Impact On Our Image and Business. Our operations, which we carry out on behalf of industrial customers or local governments, include the provision of essential services and always require human labor for their implementation. We operate in diverse locations, sometimes under difficult working conditions. We cannot guarantee that we will not encounter labor disputes (strikes, walkouts, blocking access to sites, or the destruction of property in extreme cases) that could interrupt our operations over a significant period of time. In particular, our transformation, including the implementation of our Convergence Plan, which includes significant reorganization and the refocusing of our activities on certain businesses and geographical regions, could cause industrial relations to deteriorate and negatively affect productivity and, consequently, our results. Any such disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results or outlook, as well as on our reputation. We May be Unable to Maintain and Recruit Employees With the Skills Necessary For Our Evolving Business. Our activities require a wide range of continually evolving skills in order to keep up with changes in our sector, in particular in our environment-related business. We may be unable to locate professionals with new skills, train staff in new techniques and recruit and train managers in every country where we do business in a timely manner. The implementation of our Convergence Plan, which involves significant reorganization, may exacerbate this risk. -10- Table of Contents There Are Legal Matters in Which Adverse Outcomes Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition. New legal proceedings and inquiries involving our Group were initiated in 2012, including a procedure launched by the European Commission investigating the possible existence of an anti-competitive cartel in the water sector, and several actions, concern Société Nationale Maritime Corse Méditerranée (SNCM) and include allegations of receiving improper State Aid. Unfavorable outcomes in these matters, or in other matters, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or business. See Item 8. Financial Information  Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information  Litigation and Note 36 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Unavailability of Our Information Systems Due to Disaster or Successful Hacking Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Our operations and the management of our business, including the finance and human resources components, depend on the secure and reliable performance of our information systems. The unavailability of information systems because of a disaster or successful hacking involving one or more of these information systems could have major consequences for the quality or even the continuity of services and the availability, integrity and confidential nature of our data. Despite all of our efforts and the resources put in place to protect and secure our information systems, we may still be the target of a successful cyber-attack. Any compromise of our systems could result in a loss of confidence in our security protocols and subject us to litigation, civil or criminal penalties, and adverse publicity that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Activities Expose Us to Counterparty Risk, Including Failures By Customers, Suppliers, Joint-Venture Partners, Intermediaries, Financial Agents, and Banks. Counterparty risk is the risk that we may enter into a contract with an entity that is unable to fulfill its commitments, financial and otherwise (including, debt repayment, breach of warranties, offset under a derivative transaction, etc.). In 2011 and 2012 certain customers (particularly in Italy) were unable or unwilling to pay amounts owing to us. Our financial counterparty risk is mainly associated with cash investments and positive market values on derivatives. In addition, the financial counterparty risk for our subsidiaries is in respect of the amounts held in local deposits, amounts treated by local banking institutions (such as settlement, sight deposits, and signature commitments), and the continuation of confirmed credit facilities obtained from banks. In addition, we may be required to conduct our activities in France and abroad through partnerships with public authorities or private companies. These partnerships offer a means of sharing the economic and financial risks associated with certain major projects or activities. While the partial loss of control granted in return for reducing capital exposure is managed contractually, changes in the project, or in the economic and political context, or a downturn in the economic position of our partner(s) could lead to conflict between the partners and, in severe cases, end the partnership. Situations involving the poor performance of a partnership could have a significant impact on our activities, financial position, results or outlook. Finally, actions by employees, agents and representatives, who do not comply with our Ethics, Commitment and Responsibility program or the specific ethics codes applicable to various activities, could expose us to civil or criminal penalties and adversely affect our reputation. Risks Relating to our Shares and ADSs Because Preemptive Rights May Not Be Available For U.S. Persons, the Ownership Percentages of Our U.S. Shareholders May be Diluted in the Event of a Capital Increase of Our Company. Under French law, shareholders have preemptive rights (droits préférentiels de souscription) to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for cash issuances of new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares. U.S. holders of our shares may not be able to exercise preemptive rights for our shares unless a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), is effective with respect to those rights or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. We are not required to file registration statements in connection with issues of new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire shares to our shareholders. As a result, we may from time to time issue new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares at a time when no registration statement is in effect. If we undertake future unregistered capital increases, holders of our ADSs and U.S. holders of our shares may be subject to dilution, which may not be fully compensated by the proceeds from the sale of rights. -11- Table of Contents We are Permitted to File Less Information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Than a Company Incorporated in the United States. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from rules under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), that impose some disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. Additionally, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of our shares. We are also exempt from certain rules governing the independence of the Audit and Compensation committees of our Board of Directors. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be less information concerning our Company publicly available from time to time than there is for U.S. companies at those times. The Ability of Holders of Our ADSs to Influence the Governance of Our Company May Be Limited. Holders of our ADSs may not have the same ability to influence corporate governance with respect to our Company as would shareholders in some U.S. companies. For example, the ADS depositary may not receive voting materials in time to ensure that holders of our ADSs can instruct the depositary to vote their shares. In addition, the depositarys liability to holders of our ADSs for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions is limited by the deposit agreement. Finally, except under limited circumstances, our shareholders do not have the power to call shareholders meetings. You May Be Required To Pay a Financial Transactions Tax in Connection with Acquisition of Our Shares Under French law, a financial transactions tax is applicable to the acquisition of our shares, generally in an amount equal to 0.2% of the consideration paid or the value of the shares acquired. The tax is due regardless of where the transaction takes place, and regardless of the form of acquisition. The acquisition of an ADR is considered to be the acquisition of our shares for purposes of the tax. The financial transactions tax is generally collected by financial intermediaries that execute transactions. In addition, other proposed financial transactions taxes, including a draft European directive, may become effective in the coming years. Such taxes will increase the transaction costs associated with purchases and sales of our shares (including ADRs) and could reduce the liquidity of the market for our shares. -12- Table of Contents
