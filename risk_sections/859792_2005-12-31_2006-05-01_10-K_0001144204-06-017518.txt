Item 1A. Risk Factors FOR THE TWO YEARS WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR ANY REVENUES AND WE DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS. IF WE DO NOT CONSUMMATE A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE NO REVENUES AND OUR SHARE PRICE WILL LIKELY DECLINE. As of December 31, 2005, our cash and cach equivalents consisted of $91,000. Since July 1, 1995, we have not generated any revenue. As of December 31, 2005, we had an accumulated deficit of $58,355,000. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we incurred total expenses of $1,023,000 and $1,265,000, respectively. We will, in all likelihood, continue to incur operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination or the successful commercialization of assets that we acquire. As a result, we will continue to operate at a loss at least until a business combination with Kraft Rt. or another company can be completed or we successfully develop acquired assets into a viable business. We have entered into an agreement to acquire 85% of the securities of Kraft Rt. and are presently in negotiations to acquire the remaining 15%. There is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire the securities of Kraft Rt. If we are unable to finalize the Kraft Rt. acquisition or complete a business combination, or develop assets that we acquire into a viable business, and generate revenues, our share price will likely decline. THE NATURE OF OUR PROPOSED PLAN OF OPERATION IS EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE AND OUR SUCCESS AND POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO ACCURATELY EVALUATE THE MERITS AND RISKS OF AN INVESTMENT IN US. THESE RISKS MAKE IT VERY LIKELY THAT OUR SHARE PRICE COULD DECLINE. The success of our proposed plan of operation depends to a great extent on the operations and financial condition of a target business to combine with us. While our management would prefer business combinations with entities having established operating histories, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in locating a candidate that meets such criteria. In the event we complete a business combination - an event for which there can be no assurance - the success of our operations will depend upon management of the target business, other risks inherent to business combination transactions and specific risks to the type of business acquired, which cannot be determined at this time. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including increased expenses and working capital requirements and the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired companies. In addition, acquisitions involve financial risks, such as potential liabilities of the acquired business, dilutive effects of the issuance of additional equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, the financial impact of transaction expenses and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any transactions that are accounted for by using the purchase method of accounting, and possible adverse tax and accounting effects. All of the foregoing increase the speculative nature of our plan of operation and make it difficult to accurately evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in us. All of the foregoing factors make it very likely that that our share price could decline. FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE OUR POTENTIAL GROWTH POTENTIAL WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO HOLDERS OF OUR SECURITIES. Since we currently have no operations and our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2005 was only $91,000, any significant growth will place considerable strain on our financial resources and increase demands on our management and on our operational and administrative systems, controls and other resources. There can be no assurance that our existing personnel, systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations in the future or that we will be able to successfully implement appropriate measures consistent with our growth strategy. As part of this growth, we may have to implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employees and maintain close coordination among our technical, accounting, finance, marketing, sales and editorial staff. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so, or that if we are able to do so, we will be able to effectively integrate them into our existing staff and systems. We may fail to adequately manage our anticipated future growth. We will also need to continue to attract, retain and integrate personnel in all aspects of our operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could hurt our business. CONSUMMATION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION INVOLVING THE ISSUANCE OF OUR EQUITY SECURITIES AS CONSIDERATION OR PARTIAL CONSIDERATION WILL DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. Our plan for a business combination may involve the issuance of our equity securities as consideration, or partial consideration, for acquiring a business. Specifically, our current agreements to acquire 85% of Kraft Rt. will require that we issue Preferred Shares that are convertible into approximately 29,925,000 shares of common stock. Further, if we are able to enter into an agreement to acquire the remaining 15% of Kraft Rt. we will be required to issue Preferred Shares that are issuable into approximately 6,075,000 shares of common stock. The issuance of these equity securities as consideration for such a business combination, the ownership and voting interests of our current stockholders will be materially diluted. 4 SEC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS MAY DELAY OR PRECLUDE ACQUISITION TARGETS. Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and rules promulgated thereunder, require reporting companies to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including audited financial statements for businesses acquired, covering one, two, or three years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition. New SEC rules and forms effective in August 2005 require that reporting companies with insignificant operations must file such audited financial statements with the SEC within four business days of completing the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target businesses to prepare such financial statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by us. EXISTING TAX LAWS COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WHICH MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Federal and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be significant considerations in any business combination undertaken by us. Currently, such transactions may be structured so as to result in tax-free treatment to all parties involved, pursuant to various federal and state tax laws. We intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both us and the target business. However, there can be no assurance that such business combination will meet the statutory and regulatory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK OUR HISTORIC STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN VOLATILE AND THE FUTURE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE. FURTHER, THE LIMITED MARKET FOR OUR SHARES WILL MAKE OUR PRICE MORE VOLATILE. THIS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A POSITIVE RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT. The public market for our common stock has historically been very volatile. Any future market price for our shares is likely to continue to be very volatile. This price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell shares when you want at prices you find attractive. We do not know of any one particular factor that has caused volatility in our stock price. However, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. Broad market factors and the investing public's negative perception of our business may reduce our stock price, regardless of our operating performance. Further, the market for our common stock is limited and we cannot assure you that a larger market will ever be developed or maintained. The average daily trading volume of our common stock has historically been insignificant. Market fluctuations and volatility, as well as general economic, market and political conditions, could reduce our market price. As a result, this may make it difficult or impossible for you to sell our common stock or to sell our common stock for a positive return on your investment. OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE "PENNY STOCK" RULES OF THE SEC AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SECURITIES IS LIMITED, WHICH MAKES TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. The SEC has adopted Rule 3a51-1 which establishes the definition of a "penny stock," for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15g-9 requires: o that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and o the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: o obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and o make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: o sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and o that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. 5 Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the "penny stock" rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
