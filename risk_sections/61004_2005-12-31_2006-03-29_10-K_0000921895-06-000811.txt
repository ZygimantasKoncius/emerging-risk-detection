ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITY. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING US. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE ARE IMMATERIAL ALSO MAY IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND OUR LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE INCURRED OPERATING LOSSES IN TWO OF THE PAST THREE YEARS AND FACE UNCERTAINTY IN OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OPERATING PROFITS IN THE FUTURE. We have incurred operating losses in two of the past three years. We suffered operating losses of $2,888,000 and $832,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. While we achieved an operating profit of $1,178,000 in 2005, we are uncertain whether we will be able to sustain operating profits in the future. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE NECESSARY FINANCING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS OR STRATEGIC GROWTH. In order to achieve our strategic business objectives, we may be required to seek additional financing. We may be unable to renew our existing credit facilities or obtain new financing on acceptable terms, or at all. Under certain of our existing credit facilities, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for most additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including specific financial ratios. For example, we may require further capital to continue to develop our technology and infrastructure and for working capital purposes. In addition, future acquisitions would likely require additional equity and/or debt financing. Our failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our continued development or growth. 8 AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE DEPEND ON THE OPERATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS. We are a holding company that transacts all of our business through operating subsidiaries. Our primary assets are the shares of our operating subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our operating requirements and to make other payments depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds. Payments of dividends and advances and repayments of inter-company debt by our subsidiaries are restricted by our credit agreements. WE MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL OR FAIL TO PROPERLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO OUR OPERATIONS. We intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding such opportunities or, if we do identify such opportunities, we may not be able to complete such transactions for reasons including a failure to secure necessary financing. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: o the diversion of our management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture; o possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; o substantial acquisition related expenses, which would reduce our net income in future years; o the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management; and o our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. YOUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE CORPORATE DECISIONS MAY BE LIMITED BECAUSE OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS OWN IN THE AGGREGATE 41% OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Our principal shareholders currently own in the aggregate approximately 41% of our outstanding common stock. These shareholders may be able to determine who will be elected to our board of directors and to control substantially all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including mergers, sales of assets and approval of other significant corporate transactions, in a manner with which you may not agree or that may not be in your best interest. This concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling shareholders. PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND UNDER INDIANA LAW MAY PREVENT OR DELAY A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF US AND COULD ALSO LIMIT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Indiana corporate law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include those: o prohibiting our shareholders from fixing the number of our directors; o requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations; and o prohibiting shareholders from acting by written consent, unless unanimous. We are subject to certain provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law, or IBCL, that limit business combination transactions with 10% shareholders during the first five years of their ownership, absent approval of our board of directors. The IBCL also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition was approved in advance by shareholders. These 9 provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our common shares. COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WILL EITHER REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES OR CEASE TO BE A REPORTING COMPANY. Keeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and American Stock Exchange rules, will require an increased amount of management attention and external resources. We would be required to invest additional resources to comply with evolving standards, which would result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our Board of Directors may determine that it is in the best interests of shareholders to eliminate or reduce such expense by ceasing to be a reporting company for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. One commonly used method, subject to shareholder approval, is to effect a reverse share split to reduce the number of shareholders to fewer than 300, permitting termination of registration. Under this method, shareholders who own less than one whole common share following the reverse split would cease to be shareholders and would receive a cash payment for their fractional shares. After a reverse split, there might be no established trading market for our common shares, although we expect that our common shares may then be quoted on the "pink sheets." WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF BEING NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT BROUGHT UNDER THE SO-CALLED "QUI TAM" PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT. The Company, Lynch Interactive Corporation, which was formed via a tax-free spin-off from Lynch Corporation on September 1, 1999 ("Lynch Interactive") and various other parties are defendants in a lawsuit brought under the so-called "qui tam" provisions of the federal False Claims Act in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The main allegation in the case is that the defendants participated in the creation of "sham" bidding entities that allegedly defrauded the U.S. Treasury Department by improperly participating in Federal Communications Commission spectrum auctions restricted to small businesses, and obtained bidding credits in other spectrum auctions allocated to "small" and "very small" businesses. The lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of damages, which amount would be automatically tripled under the statute. Although Lynch Interactive is contractually bound to indemnify us for any losses or damages we may incur as a result of this lawsuit, Lynch Interactive may lack the capital resources to do so. As a result, we could be held liable and forced to pay a significant amount of damages without recourse. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON SHARES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We anticipate that all of our earnings will be retained for the development of our business. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy of not paying cash dividends on our common shares. The Company also has restrictions under our debt agreements which limit our ability to pay dividends. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. THERE IS A LIMITED MARKET FOR OUR COMMON SHARES. OUR SHARE PRICE IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COULD DROP UNEXPECTEDLY. There is a limited public market for our common shares, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop. As a result of low trading volume in our common shares, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of shares could result in significant share price fluctuations. Our share price may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including the following, several of which are beyond our control: o changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts relating to our shares; 10 o loss of a major customer; o announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and o changes in key personnel. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, would likely cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, harm our reputation in the industry and the securities markets and reduce our profitability. SECURITIES ANALYSTS MAY NOT INITIATE COVERAGE OF OUR COMMON SHARES OR MAY ISSUE NEGATIVE REPORTS, AND THIS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. We cannot assure you that securities analysts will initiate coverage and publish research reports on us. It is difficult for companies with smaller market capitalizations, such as us, to attract independent financial analysts who will cover our common shares. If securities analysts do not, this lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common shares. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INTRODUCE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE. Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce and market innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change and to customize some of our products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely or cost-effective manner to satisfy customer demand. OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, HEALTH, REGULATORY AND OTHER FACTORS EXISTING IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. As we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: o political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured and sold; o expropriation or the imposition of government controls; o sanctions or restrictions on trade imposed by the United States government; o export license requirements; o trade restrictions; o currency controls or fluctuations in exchange rates; o high levels of inflation or deflation; o greater difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; o changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; and o limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters and business operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to some of our foreign competitors. In response to competitive pressures and customer requirements, we may further expand internationally at lower cost locations. If we expand into these locations, we will be required to incur additional capital expenditures. 11 OUR BUSINESSES ARE CYCLICAL. A DECLINE IN DEMAND IN THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENT AND GLASS COMPONENT INDUSTRIES MAY RESULT IN ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DEFERRALS AND LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. Our subsidiaries sell to industries that are subject to cyclical economic changes. The electronic component and glass component industries in general, and specifically the Company, could experience a decline in product demand on a global basis, resulting in order cancellations and deferrals and lower average selling prices. A slowing of growth in the demand for components used by telecommunications infrastructure manufacturers and newer technologies introduced in the glass display industry could lead to a decline. If a slowdown occurs, it may continue and may become more pronounced. OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY LOSE BUSINESS TO LARGER AND BETTER-FINANCED COMPETITORS. Our markets are highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers. We compete principally on the basis of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery and price. All of the industries in which we compete have become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years. Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer support capabilities than we have. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN OUR KEY MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL AND ATTRACTING, RETAINING, AND TRAINING NEW TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. Our future growth and success will depend in large part upon our ability to retain our existing management and technical team and to recruit and retain highly skilled technical personnel, including engineers. The labor markets in which we operate are highly competitive and most of our operations are not located in highly populated areas. As a result, we may not be able to retain and recruit key personnel. Our failure to hire, retain or adequately train key personnel could have a negative impact on our performance. Mtron/PTI'S BACKLOG MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE REVENUES AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Mtron/PTI's backlog comprises orders that are subject to specific production release orders under written contracts, oral and written orders from customers with which Mtron/PTI has had long-standing relationships and written purchase orders from sales representatives. Mtron/PTI's customers may order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long and may cancel or defer orders without significant penalty. They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a phenomenon that Mtron/PTI experienced in the most recent economic slowdown. As a result, Mtron/PTI's backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual revenues for any succeeding period. Mtron/PTI RELIES UPON ONE CONTRACT MANUFACTURER FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS FINISHED PRODUCTS, AND A DISRUPTION IN ITS RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON Mtron/PTI'S REVENUES. In 2005, approximately 14% of Mtron/PTI's revenue was attributable to finished products that were manufactured by an independent contract manufacturer located in both Korea and China. We expect this manufacturer to account for a smaller but substantial portion of Mtron/PTI's revenues in 2006 and a material portion of Mtron/PTI's revenues for the next several years. Mtron/PTI does not have a written, long-term supply contract with this manufacturer. If this manufacturer becomes unable to provide products in the quantities needed, or at acceptable prices, Mtron/PTI would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacement manufacturers or manufacture the products internally. Due to specific product knowledge and process capability, Mtron/PTI could encounter difficulties in locating, qualifying and entering into arrangements with replacement manufacturers. As a result, a reduction in the production capability or financial viability of this manufacturer, or a termination of, or significant interruption in, Mtron/PTI's relationship with this manufacturer, may adversely affect Mtron/PTI's results of operations and our financial condition. 12 Mtron/PTI PURCHASES CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES AND COULD LOSE SALES IF THESE SOURCES FAIL TO FULFILL OUR NEEDS. If single source components were to become unavailable on satisfactory terms, and could not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. On occasion, one or more of the components used in our products have become unavailable, resulting in unanticipated redesign and related delays in shipments. We cannot assure you that similar delays will not occur in the future. Our suppliers may be impacted by compliance to environmental regulations including RoHS & WEEE, which could affect our continued supply of components or cause additional costs for us to implement new components into our manufacturing process. Mtron/PTI'S PRODUCTS ARE COMPLEX AND MAY CONTAIN ERRORS OR DESIGN FLAWS, WHICH COULD BE COSTLY TO CORRECT. When we release new products, or new versions of existing products, they may contain undetected or unresolved errors or defects. Despite testing, errors or defects may be found in new products or upgrades after the commencement of commercial shipments. Undetected errors and design flaws have occurred in the past and could occur in the future. These errors could result in delays, loss of market acceptance and sales, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, legal action by our customers, failure to attract new customers and increased service costs. CONTINUED MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF Mtron/PTI'S PACKAGED QUARTZ CRYSTALS, OSCILLATOR MODULES AND ELECTRONIC FILTERS IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS, BECAUSE FREQUENCY CONTROL DEVICES ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY ALL OF Mtron/PTI'S REVENUES. Virtually all of Mtron/PTI's 2005 and 2004 revenues came from sales of frequency control devices, which consist of packaged quartz crystals, oscillator modules and electronic filters. We expect that this product line will continue to account for substantially all of Mtron/PTI's revenues for the foreseeable future. Any decline in demand for this product line or failure to achieve continued market acceptance of existing and new versions of this product line may harm Mtron/PTI's business and our financial condition. Mtron/PTI'S FUTURE RATE OF GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF THE MARKET FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT. Mtron/PTI's business depends heavily upon capital expenditures by the providers of communications and network services. In 2005, the majority of Mtron/PTI's revenues was to manufacturers of communications and network infrastructure equipment, including indirect sales through distributors and contract manufacturers. In 2006, Mtron/PTI expects a smaller but significant portion of its revenues to be to manufacturers of communications and network infrastructure equipment. Mtron/PTI intends to increase its sales to communications and network infrastructure equipment manufacturers in the future. Communications and network service providers have experienced periods of capacity shortage and periods of excess capacity. In periods of excess capacity, communications systems and network operators cut purchases of capital equipment, including equipment that incorporates Mtron/PTI's products. A slowdown in the manufacture and purchase of communications and network infrastructure equipment could substantially reduce Mtron/PTI's net sales and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. Moreover, if the market for communications or network infrastructure equipment fails to grow as expected, Mtron/PTI may be unable to sustain its growth. In addition, Mtron/PTI's growth depends upon the acceptance of its products by communications and network infrastructure equipment manufacturers. If, for any reason, these manufacturers do not find Mtron/PTI's products to be appropriate for their use, our future growth will be adversely affected. COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS INCREASINGLY RELY UPON CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, THEREBY DIMINISHING Mtron/PTI'S ABILITY TO SELL ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THOSE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. There is a growing trend among communications and network infrastructure equipment manufacturers to outsource the manufacturing of their equipment or components. As a result, Mtron/PTI's ability to persuade these original equipment manufacturers to specify our products has been reduced and, in the absence of a manufacturer's specification of Mtron/PTI's products, the prices that Mtron/PTI can charge for them may be subject to greater competition. 13 MtronPTI'S CUSTOMERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN IT AND THEY MAY EXERT LEVERAGE THAT WILL NOT BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF MtronPTI. The majority of MtronPTI's sales are to companies that are many times its size. This size differential may put MtronPTI in a disadvantage while negotiating contractual terms and may result in terms that are not in the best interest of MtronPTI. These items may include price, payment terms, product warranties and product consignment obligations. FUTURE CHANGES IN Mtron/PTI'S ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY AND COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS MAY INCREASE COSTS AND DECREASE PROFITABILITY. Mtron/PTI's manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and other chemicals. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in Mtron/PTI's operations that any future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance that would be associated with these regulations. THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS RECENTLY ISSUED ITS RESTRICTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE ("THE RHSD"), WHICH RESTRICTS THE USE OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF COMPONENT PARTS EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2006. We may need to change our manufacturing processes, redesign some of our products, and change components to eliminate these hazardous substances in our products in order to be able to continue to offer them for sale within the European Union. SALES OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES SUBJECTS US TO BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS. Our export sales, which are primarily to Canada, Asia, Western Europe accounted for 46% of revenues during 2005 and 48% of revenues during 2004. We anticipate that sales to customers located outside of the United Sates will continue to be a significant part of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Because significant portions of our sales are to customers outside of the United States, we are subject to risks including foreign currency fluctuations, longer payment cycles, reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights, political and economic instability, and export restrictions. To date, very few of our international revenue and cost obligations have been denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, in increase in the value of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and thus, less competitive in foreign markets. We do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities, but may do so in the future to the extent that such obligations become more significant. LYNCH SYSTEMS' REVENUE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON DEMAND FOR ITS TELEVISIONS AND COMPUTER MONITORS BASED ON CATHODE-RAY TUBE TECHNOLOGY. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL EVENTUALLY BE REPLACED BY PLASMA AND LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS. Lynch Systems generates a significant portion of its revenue from sales to glass producers that supply television and computer monitor displays that are based on cathode-ray tube technology. This market is being rapidly penetrated by thinner, lighter weight plasma displays and liquid crystal displays. Although cathode-ray tube televisions and computer monitors currently retain advantages in image quality and price, glass producers are investing billions of dollars to improve the quality and lower the unit price of plasma, liquid crystal and other display types. We believe that market penetration by plasma and liquid crystal display producers will continue and eventually render obsolete cathode-ray tube technology and this Lynch Systems product line. LYNCH SYSTEMS' DEPENDENCE ON A FEW SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS EXPOSES IT TO OPERATING RISKS. Lynch Systems' sales to its ten largest customers accounted for approximately 79% and 80% of its revenues in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Lynch Systems' sales to its largest customer accounted for approximately 46% and 36% 14 of its revenues in 2005 and 2004, respectively. If a significant customer reduces, delays or cancels its orders for any reason, the business and results of operations of Lynch Systems would be negatively affected. A MULTIPLE MACHINE ORDER WITH A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER IN THE TABLEWARE MARKET MAY NOT BE REALIZED IN FULL. Lynch Systems has a significant order for glass manufacturing machines which may not be realized in full. In 2004, Lynch Systems signed a contract to sell five machines for a total purchase price of $2,350,000. The contract was accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Throughout 2004 and 2005, revenues totaling approximately $1,983,000 were recorded relating to the five machines based upon the percentage completed. There was no profit recorded to date on this contract. In late 2005, the first machine was completed and shipped. The installation of the machine has been delayed several times due to the customer temporarily closing down its plant. The customer has now indicated that the plant will open in mid 2006 and that the machine can be installed at that time. The customer has stated that when the first machine is operational, it will pay for the first machine and accept deliveries on three additional machines over the next 12 to 18 months. Management fully expects that the customer will honor its commitment; however, the Company has provided a reserve of $350,000 against the billed receivable, unbilled receivable and inventory balances at December 31, 2005. If the customer does not honor its commitment, additional provisions may be required, based upon the ultimate disposition of the machines. THE RESULTS OF LYNCH SYSTEMS' OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF STEEL USED TO MANUFACTURE GLASS FORMING EQUIPMENT. Lynch Systems uses large amounts of steel to manufacture its glass forming equipment. The price of steel has risen substantially and demand for steel is very high. Lynch Systems has only been able to pass some of the increased costs to its customers. As a result, Lynch Systems' profit margins on glass forming equipment have decreased. If the price of and demand for steel continues to rise, our profit margins will continue to decrease. LYNCH SYSTEMS MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The success of Lynch Systems' business depends, in part, upon its ability to protect trade secrets, designs, drawings and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. Lynch Systems relies on a combination of trade secrets, designs, drawings, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products and technology. The steps taken by Lynch Systems in this regard may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which Lynch Systems operates do not protect its proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although Lynch Systems continues to evaluate and implement protective measures, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful. Lynch Systems' inability to protect its intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that it derives from its technology, cause Lynch Systems to lose sales or otherwise harm its business. ---------------------------------------------- FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
