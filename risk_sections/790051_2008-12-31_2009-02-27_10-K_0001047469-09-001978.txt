Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below, those set forth in our "Forward Looking Statements" disclosure in Item 7 and those set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. The demand for the Company's products may be adversely affected by deteriorating macroeconomic and business conditions. The recession in the United States and in key foreign markets could substantially affect the Company's sales, profitability and financial condition. The sharp downturn has reduced economic activity in many of the product markets in which we operate. Many of these markets are cyclical and have experienced downturns. It cannot be predicted when, or to what extent, there might be a recovery. Actions taken by major governments throughout the world to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be fully effective in addressing the economic problems that are causing the recession and the increased concern over the general soundness of the U.S. and foreign economies. The reduced demand for the Company's products from prolonged economic decline would likely result in lower revenues, excess production capacity, higher cost, and margin compression on some products. Access to cost-effective sources of capital may be affected by current global financial system problems. The ability of the Company, its customers and suppliers to obtain capital with reasonable terms to support business activities including developing lines of credit, refinancing existing debt, funding capital projects, and financing acquisitions is likely to be negatively affected by the global financial crisis. A downgrade in the Company's debt ratings could restrict the ability to access the debt capital markets and could increase interest expense on existing financing agreements. The inability to maintain or to expand credit facilities on similar terms may have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial position, results of operations and free cash flow. The Company's reliance on customers and vendors to meet their obligations could be reduced because of their potential difficulty in accessing outside financing. Extended difficulties by owners and developers to secure financing for new residential and commercial construction projects will likely reduce the demand for roofing products from the Company's construction materials operations. A slowdown resulting from restricted credit availability in the commercial construction industry would likely reduce the demand for both new roofing products and reroofing products. The Company's objective is to achieve organic sales growth greater than the percentage growth of U.S. national gross domestic product. As the Company continues to grow organically through the construction of new plants and distribution centers, it must balance the benefits against the risks of expanding its business to a level that cannot be supported through its existing customer base or entry into new markets. The Company's growth is partially dependent on the acquisition of other businesses. The Company has a long standing acquisition program and expects to continue acquiring businesses. Typically, the Company considers acquiring bolt-ons. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include potential difficulties in integrating the business into existing operations, increasing dependency on the 9 markets served by certain businesses, and increased debt to finance the acquisitions. The Company also considers the acquisition of businesses which can operate independently of existing operations, which has an increased possibility of diverting management's attention from its core operations. Material costs are a significant component of the Company's cost structure. The Company utilizes petroleum based products, steel and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, account for approximately 63% of the Company's cost of goods sold. Significant increases in the price of these materials may not be recovered through sale price and could adversely affect operating results. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by slow or unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, and global economic conditions. The Company must balance the inventory it carries with market demand. A significant increase in demand for its products could result in additional inventory demand which could cause a short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase of inventory on hand and as well as increased costs due to production cutbacks and inefficiencies. Benefits from the present restructuring activities are expected to include an improvement in customer service, cost reductions, higher productivity and lower working capital. The steps being taken to consolidate manufacturing and distribution centers could cause disruptions to customers and the potential loss of a portion of their business. Major projects are underway or planned in the tire and wheel business, the construction materials business and the foodservice business. In addition, the Company is evaluating its plant reconstruction options related to the fire at the tire and wheel plant in Bowdon, GA. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information. If the realignment and resizing does not meet the projected operational and market requirements, the objectives of the restructuring will not be achieved, resulting in potential further restructuring actions and employee dissatisfaction. The products manufactured may become obsolete due to design or technology changes. The Company's future operating success may depend upon its ability to redesign or find new applications for its current products or develop new products. The Company faces increased international competition. The tire and wheel business competes against companies that leverage low cost manufacturing through facilities located outside the United States. While the Company has been price competitive, it may need to adjust its operating strategies to remain competitive against the off-shore competition. The Company is expanding its operations into China. To compete globally against low-cost manufacturers with operations located outside the United States, the Company has expanded many of its operations into China. Conducting operations within China may cause the Company to be impacted by the political environment within China and trade relations between the United States and Chinese governments. Many of the products manufactured in China are sold in the North American market. Therefore the Company may be impacted by the cost and availability of shipping channels and amount of time required to ship the goods to the intended market. Revenues for sales of products manufactured in China for the North American market are generated predominately in U.S. Dollars. Many of the obligations incurred by these operations are settled in Chinese Renminbi or Hong Kong Dollars. Should the U.S. Dollar weaken significantly against the Renminbi or Hong Kong Dollar, the Company's results of operations could be adversely affected. The Company continues to monitor developments in China that may affect its strategy and will hedge its currency risk exposure when deemed effective and prudent. Recent tax law changes in China to reduce value added tax refunds on exported products and to conform income tax laws for both domestic and foreign owned companies may increase tax burdens for Carlisle's in-country operations. 10 The Company plans to grow through expansion of international sales. As the Company strives to reach this strategic goal, the Company may be impacted by the political environment in various countries and government trade relations with the U.S., as well as local country market factors. International sales expansion may also require an additional commitment to the Company's level of working capital. The Company and the markets it serves can be negatively impacted by significant changes in interest rates. The Company may utilize interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to mitigate its interest rate, currency and investment risk. Many of the markets served by Carlisle are impacted by interest rates. A significant rise in interest rates may curtail construction activities and other capital spending, as well as consumer spending, all of which could have an adverse impact on operating results. The Company has significant concentrations in the general construction and lawn and garden markets. For the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 50% of the Company's revenues, and 54% of its operating income (excluding Corporate expenses) were generated by the Construction Materials segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in construction spending by federal, state, and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market, as well as certain other operations of the Company, could adversely affect the Company's performance. The construction materials business competes through pricing, among other factors. Increased competition in this business has and could continue to place negative pressure on operating results in future periods. Approximately 29% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, and 18% of its operating income (excluding Corporate expenses) were generated by the Company's Transportation Products segment. The businesses in this segment rely heavily on the condition of the lawn and garden and construction equipment markets. Softening in this market could place negative pressure on the Company's results of operations. The commercial construction market and lawn and garden market can be affected by weather. Adverse weather conditions, such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials. Weather conditions can also be a positive factor, as demand for roofing materials may rise after harsh weather conditions due to the need for replacement materials. The lawn and garden market is also affected by extreme weather conditions, which could impact demand for outdoor power equipment. The Company also serves many specialty niche markets and as such, may be negatively impacted by softening in those markets. In addition to having concentrations in the construction materials and lawn and garden markets, many of the markets served by Carlisle, including the specialty trailer, refrigerated truck bodies, and foodservice products markets, are smaller, niche markets that may experience cyclicality. These market cycles can span a number of years, and while the Company benefits from the upside of these cycles, downturns can negatively affect performance. Changes in business conditions could cause goodwill to become impaired. The Company has a long-standing strategy to acquire interests in other businesses. These investments are made after careful analysis and the completion of due diligence procedures. The analysis and procedures often include assumptions and judgments in the determination of the acquisition price. After acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise that adversely affect the expected returns and the unfavorable financial impact may not be recoverable through an adjustment to the acquisition price. In addition, unexpected difficulties encountered during integration could cause actual operating results to vary from initial estimates. The amount of goodwill is a significant portion of the Company's total assets. An evaluation of impairment of goodwill is made annually or when evidence of a potential impairment exists, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets ("SFAS 142"). The impairment evaluation is 11 based on several factors involving assumptions and judgment regarding expected cash flows. If the assumptions and judgment indicate that goodwill impairment exists for an operating unit, the result could be a substantial asset charge that reduces the Company's operating income and could cause a default in the covenants covered by the Company's debt and credit facility agreements. The Company is impacted by the cost of providing pension benefits. Pension expense associated with the Company's retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending on changes in actuarial assumptions and the future market performance of plan assets. The Company continues to be negatively impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post-retirement benefits. The underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans will require cash payments. Additionally, if pension plan assets do not perform to the Company's expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, the required contributions may be higher than anticipated. Significant changes in retirement plan discount rates and in the actual investment return on pension assets could affect the Company's net income, pension benefit obligation, shareholders' equity and retirement plan contributions in future periods. Net income may be negatively impacted by a decrease in the rate of return on plan assets. Income or expense for the plans is calculated using actuarial valuations. Unfavorable changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant assumptions used are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The key economic factors that affect the expense would also likely affect the amount of cash contributions to the pension and post-employment plans. Item 1BUnresolved Staff Comments None. 12
