Item 1A. Risk Factors The following important factors could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those results contained in forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere by management from time to time. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. Our success depends on our relationships with strategic partners and with distributors and any reduction in the sales efforts by distributors, or cooperative efforts from our partners, could materially impact our revenues We rely on close cooperation with partners for sales and product development as well as for the optimization of opportunities which arise in our competitive environment. As well, a portion of our license revenues are derived from the license of our products through third parties. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to maintain access to existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop. We may not be able to retain a sufficient number of our existing distributors or develop a sufficient number of future distributors. Distributors may also give higher priority to the sale of products other than ours (which could include competitors products) or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing our products. The performance of third party distributors is largely outside of our control, and we are unable to predict the extent to which these distributors will be successful in marketing and licensing our products. A reduction in partner cooperation or sales efforts, a decline in the number of distributors, or a decision by our distributors to discontinue the sale of our products could materially reduce revenue. If we do not continue to develop new technologically advanced products that successfully integrate with the software products and enhancements used by our customers, then future revenues will be negatively affected Our success depends upon our ability to design, develop, test, market, license and support new software products and enhancements of current products on a timely basis in response to both competitive threats and marketplace demands. In addition, new software products and enhancements must remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. Often, we must integrate software licensed or acquired from third parties with our proprietary software to create or improve our products. These products are important to the success of our strategy. If we are unable to achieve a successful integration with third party software, we may not be 10 Table of Contents successful in developing and marketing our new software products and enhancements. If we are unable to successfully integrate the technologies to develop new software products and enhancements to existing products, or to complete products currently under development which we license or acquire from third parties, our operating results will materially suffer. In addition, if the integrated or new products or enhancements do not achieve acceptance by the marketplace, our operating results will materially suffer. Also, if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to, our software products could be rendered obsolete and, as a result, our business, as well as our ability to compete in the marketplace, would be materially harmed. If our products and services do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to increase our revenues We intend to pursue our strategy of growing the capabilities of our ECM software offerings through our proprietary research and the development of new product offerings. In response to customer requests, it is important to our success that we continue: (i) to enhance our products; and (ii) to seek to set the standard for ECM capabilities. The primary market for our software and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain. If the markets for our products and services fail to develop, develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition, our business will suffer. As a result, we may be unable to: (i) successfully market our current products and services, (ii) develop new software products, services and enhancements to current products and services, (iii) complete customer installations on a timely basis, or (iv) complete products and services currently under development. If our products and services are not accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace, our business and operating results will be materially affected. Our investment in our current research and development efforts may not provide a sufficient, timely return The development of ECM software products is a costly, complex and time-consuming process, and the investment in ECM software product development often involves a long wait until a return is achieved on such an investment. We make and will continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. Investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors including the degree of innovation of the products developed through our research and development efforts, sufficient support from our strategic partners, and effective distribution and marketing. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development. These expenditures may adversely affect our operating results if they are not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive position. However, significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced for our current or historical products and services. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively We are highly dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. We intend to protect our rights vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will, in all cases, be successful. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult, particularly in some nations outside of North America in which we seek to market our products. While U.S. and Canadian copyright laws, international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of Canada or of the United States. The absence of internationally harmonized intellectual property laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for our proprietary rights. Software piracy has been, and is expected to be, a persistent problem for the software industry, and piracy of our products represents a loss of revenue to us. Where applicable, certain of our license arrangements have required us to make a limited confidential disclosure of portions of the source 11 Table of Contents code for our products, or to place such source code into an escrow for the protection of another party. Despite the precautions we have taken, unauthorized third parties, including our competitors, may be able to: (i) copy certain portions of our products; or (ii) reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Also, our competitors could independently develop technologies that are perceived to be substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. Our competitive position may be adversely affected by our possible inability to effectively protect our intellectual property. Other companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase costs and materially harm our ability to generate future revenue and profits Claims of infringement are becoming increasingly common as the software industry develops and as related legal protections, including without limitation patents, are applied to software products. Although we do not believe that our products infringe on the rights of third-parties, third-parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future. Although most of our technology is proprietary in nature, we do include certain third party software in our products. In these cases, this software is licensed from the entity holding the intellectual property rights. Although we believe that we have secured proper licenses for all third-party software that is integrated into our products, third-parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future. Any such assertion may result in litigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third-parties. Such licenses may not be available, or they may not be available on reasonable terms. In addition, such litigation could be disruptive to our ability to generate revenue and may result in significantly increased costs as a result of our defense against those claims or our attempt to license the patents or rework our products to ensure they comply with judicial decisions. Any of the foregoing could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to generate future revenue and profits. The loss of licenses to use third-party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect our business We currently depend upon a limited number of third-party software products. If such software products were not available, we might experience delays or increased costs in the development of our products. For a limited number of product modules, we rely on software products that we license from third-parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in our products to perform key functions. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors. The loss by us of the license to use, or the inability by licensors to support, maintain, and enhance any of such software, could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is developed or licensed and integrated with internally developed software. Such increased costs or delays or reductions in product shipments could adversely affect our business. Current and future competitors could have a significant impact on our ability to generate future revenue and profits The markets for our products are intensely competitive, and are subject to rapid technological change and other pressures created by changes in our industry. We expect competition to increase and intensify in the future as the pace of technological change and adaptation quickens and as additional companies enter into each of our markets. Numerous releases of competitive products have occurred in recent history and may be expected to continue in the future. We may not be able to compete effectively with current competitors and potential entrants into our marketplace. We could lose market share if our current or prospective competitors: (i) introduce new competitive products, (ii) add new functionality to existing products, (iii) acquire competitive products, (iv) reduce prices, or (v) form strategic alliances with other companies. If other businesses were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products, or if the dynamics in our marketplace resulted in increasing bargaining power by the consumers of our products and services, we would need to lower the prices we charge for the products we offer. This could result in lower revenues or reduced margins, either of which may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 12 Table of Contents Consolidation in the industry, particularly by large, well-capitalized companies, could place pressure on our operating margins which could, in turn, have a material adverse affect on our business Recent acquisitions by large, well-capitalized technology companies have changed the marketplace for our goods and services by replacing competitors which are comparable in size to our company with companies that have more resources at their disposal to compete with us in the marketplace. For example, Autonomy acquired Interwoven in March of 2009. In addition, other large corporations with considerable financial resources either have products that compete with the products we offer, or have the ability to encroach on our competitive position within our marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources; thus, they can engage in competition with our products and services on the basis of sale price, marketing, services or support. They also have the ability to introduce items that compete with our maturing products and services. The threat posed by larger competitors and the goods and services that these companies may be able to produce to our target customers at a lower cost may materially reduce the profit margins we earn on the goods and services we provide to the marketplace. Any material reduction in our profit margin may have an adverse material affect on the operations or finances of our business. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other business initiatives may negatively affect our operating results The growth of our company through the successful acquisition and integration of complementary businesses is a critical component of our corporate strategy. Thus, we continue to seek opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that expand, complement or otherwise relate to our current business. We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. These activities create risks such as: (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products, (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls, (iii) disruption of our ongoing business, and (iv) diversion of managements attention from other business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (a) substantial investment of funds; (b) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers; and (c) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in one-time charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of existing shareholders or result in the assumption of debt. Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of our company. Any such activity may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns to us, and the resources committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. Our inability: (i) to take advantage of growth opportunities for our business or for our products, or (ii) to address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses, may negatively affect our operating results. Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings which, in turn, may have an adverse material affect on the price of our Common Shares. Our acquisitions of Captaris and of Vignette may adversely affect our operations in the short term In October 2008, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Captaris, Inc. In July 2009, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Vignette Corporation. Each of these acquisitions represents a significant opportunity for our business. However, these acquisitions also present certain risks, including but not limited to:  the risk that the potential benefits of these acquisitions would not be realized fully as a result of challenges we might face in integrating the customers, technology, personnel and operations of each acquired company with ours;  the risk that the potential benefits of these acquisitions would not be realized fully as a result of general industry-wide conditions, macroeconomic developments or other factors; 13 Table of Contents  the risk that Open Texts management will need to devote substantial time and resources to the integration of the acquired corporation with ours at the expense of attending to and growing Open Texts business or other business opportunities; and  the risk associated with any other additional demands that these acquisitions would place on our management. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in retaining key Captaris or Vignette employees. In addition, our operations may be disrupted if we fail to adequately retain and motivate all of the employees who work for the combined entity. We may not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the unfunded pension obligations we assumed as a result of the Captaris acquisition When we acquired Captaris in October 2008, we assumed its unfunded pension plan liabilities. We will be required to use the operating cash flow that we generate in the future to meet these obligations. As a result, our future net pension liability and cost may be materially affected by the discount rate used to measure these pension obligations and by the longevity and actuarial profile of the relevant workforce. A change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of these pension obligations, and these changes may affect the net periodic pension cost in the year the change is made and in subsequent years. We cannot assure that we will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy these obligations. Any inability to satisfy these pension obligations may have a material adverse effect on the operational and financial health of our business. Our acquisition of Vignette obligates us to assume its unique risks Our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Vignette Corporation significantly increased the size and scope of our operations. As a result, we have to address the risks associated with the acquired business and operations. These risks include without limitation:  When the acquisition was completed, Vignette was attempting to institute significant changes to its research and development operations. We have not decided whether we will continue this transition of research and development activities. If we continue this transition, we may experience increased costs and implementation delays any of which may materially and adversely affect our operations and finances. If we decide to halt this transition, the costs associated with the abandonment of the project may also adversely affect our operations and finances.  As a result of the acquisition and in connection with Vignettes net operating loss carry forwards, we have acquired certain legacy deferred tax assets. In circumstances where there is an ownership change of the corporation, Internal Revenue Code Section 382 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of such net operating loss carry-forwards. As of current date, we are in the process of assessing whether we are able to utilize these tax attributes prior to their expiration and the eventual valuation of these deferred tax assets could materially affect the amount of goodwill recorded with respect to this acquisition. Our acquisition activity may lead to a material increase in the incurrence of debt which may adversely affect our finances We may borrow money to provide the funds necessary to pay for companies we seek to acquire, if we deem such financing activity to be appropriate. The interest costs generated under any such debt obligations may materially increase our interest expense which may materially and adversely affect our profitability as well as the price of our Common Shares. Our ability to pay the interest and repay the principal for the indebtedness we incur as a result of our acquisition activity depends upon our ability to manage our business operations and our financial resources. In addition, the agreements related to such borrowings may contain covenants requiring us to meet certain financial performance targets and operating covenants, and limiting our discretion with respect to certain business matters, such as, among other things, the payment of dividends, the borrowing of additional amounts and the making of investments. 14 Table of Contents Businesses we acquire may have disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are weaker than or otherwise not in conformity with ours We have a history of acquiring complementary businesses of varying size and organizational complexity. Upon consummating an acquisition, we seek to implement our disclosure controls and procedures as well as our internal controls over financial reporting at the acquired company as promptly as possible. Depending upon the nature of the business acquired, the implementation of our disclosure controls and procedures as well as the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired company may be a lengthy process. Typically, we conduct due diligence prior to consummating an acquisition; however, our integration efforts may periodically expose deficiencies in the disclosure controls and procedures as well as in internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired company. If such deficiencies exist, we may not be in a position to comply with our periodic reporting requirements and, as a result, our business and financial condition may be materially harmed. We must continue to manage our internal resources during periods of company growth or our operating results could be adversely affected The ECM market has continued to evolve at a rapid pace. Moreover, we have grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and expect to continue to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of our business. Our growth, coupled with the rapid evolution of our markets, has placed, and will continue to place, significant strains on our administrative and operational resources and increased demands on our internal systems, procedures and controls. Our administrative infrastructure, systems, procedures and controls may not adequately support our operations. In addition, our management may not be able to achieve the rapid, effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully implement our operational and competitive strategy. If we are unable to manage growth effectively our operating results will likely suffer which may, in turn, adversely affect our business. If we are not able to attract and retain top employees, our ability to compete may be harmed Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm our business. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. Our success is also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, retain and motivate highly qualified management, technical, sales and marketing personnel. In particular, the recruitment of top research developers and experienced salespeople remains critical to our success. Competition for such people is intense, substantial and continuous, and we may not be able to attract, integrate or retain highly qualified technical, sales or managerial personnel in the future. In addition, in our effort to attract and retain critical personnel, we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices for our products or services. Our compensation structure may hinder our efforts to attract and retain vital employees A portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel includes the award of options to buy our Common Shares. If the price of our Common Shares performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. In addition, any changes made to our stock option policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. For example, any limit to total compensation which may be proscribed by the government may hurt our ability to attract or retain our executive officers or other employees whose efforts are vital to our success. Additionally, payments under our long-term incentive plan (the details of which are described in Item 11 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) are dependent to a significant extent upon the future performance of our company both in absolute terms and in comparison to similarly situated companies. Any failure to achieve the targets set under the long-term incentive plan could significantly reduce or eliminate payments made under this plan, which may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our ability to retain the key personnel who are subject to this plan. 15 Table of Contents The length of our sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter The decision by a customer to purchase our products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customers network or networks. As a result, licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers, accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures. Given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization to implement our software, our sales cycle may be longer compared to companies in other industries. Over the past several fiscal years, we have experienced a lengthening of our sales cycle as customers include more personnel in their decisions and focus on more enterprise-wide licensing deals. In the current economic environment it is not uncommon to see reduced information technology spending. It may take several months, or even several quarters, for marketing opportunities to materialize. If a customers decision to license our software is delayed or if the installation of our products takes longer than originally anticipated, the date on which we may recognize revenue from these licenses would be delayed. Such delays could cause our revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period. Unexpected events may materially harm our ability to align when we incur expenses with when we recognize revenues We incur operating expenses based upon anticipated revenue trends. Since a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed, a delay in recognizing revenue from transactions related to these expenses (such a delay may be due to the factors described in the in the prior risk factor or it may be due to other factors) could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter, and such a delay could materially reduce operating income. If these expenses are not subsequently followed by revenues, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The restructuring of our operations may, adversely affect our business or our finances We often undertake initiatives to restructure or streamline our operations. We may incur costs associated with implementing the restructuring initiative beyond the amount contemplated when we first developed the initiative, and these increased costs may be substantial. Some of these restructuring costs may have to be treated as expenses which would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made. We will continue to evaluate our operations, and may propose future restructuring actions as a result of changes in the marketplace, including the exit from less profitable operations or the decision to terminate services which are not valued by our customers. Any failure to successfully execute these initiatives on a timely basis may have a material adverse impact on our operations. Our international operations expose us to business risks that could cause our operating results to suffer We intend to continue to make efforts to increase our international operations and anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. These international operations are subject to certain risks and costs, including the difficulty and expense of administering business and compliance abroad, compliance with domestic and foreign laws (including without limitation domestic and international import and export laws and regulations), costs related to localizing products for foreign markets, and costs related to translating and distributing products in a timely manner. International operations also tend to be subject to a longer sales and collection cycle. In addition, regulatory limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings may adversely affect the transfer of cash earned from foreign operations. Significant international sales may also expose us to greater risk from political and economic instability, unexpected changes in Canadian, United States or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers. Additionally, international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction, which may materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. Also, international expansion may be more difficult, time consuming, and costly. As a result, if revenues from international 16 Table of Contents operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations, our operating results will suffer. Moreover, in any given quarter, the change in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue, earnings or other financial measures. Our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation, be costly to correct, delay revenues, and expose us to litigation Our products are highly complex and sophisticated and, from time to time, may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct. Errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of shipments to our customers. If these defects are discovered, we may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner. In addition, despite the extensive tests we conduct on all our products, we may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which our products will operate and, as a result, we may be unable to adequately detect the design defects or software errors which may become apparent only after the products are installed in an end-users network. The occurrence of errors and failures in our products could result in the delay or the denial of market acceptance of our products; alleviating such errors and failures may require us to make significant expenditure of our resources. The harm to our reputation resulting from product errors and failures may be materially damaging. Since we regularly provide a warranty with our products, the financial impact of fulfilling warranty obligations may be significant in the future. Our agreements with our strategic partners and end-users typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims. These agreements usually contain terms such as the exclusion of all implied warranties and the limitation of the availability of consequential or incidental damages. However, such provisions may not effectively protect us against claims and the attendant liabilities and costs associated with such claims. Although we maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to cover all such claims. Accordingly, any such claim could negatively affect our financial condition. Our products rely on the stability of infrastructure software that, if not stable, could negatively impact the effectiveness of our products, resulting in harm to our reputation and business Our developments of Internet and intranet applications depend and will depend on the stability, functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet, such as the infrastructure software produced by Hewlett-Packard Company, Oracle, Microsoft and others. If weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist, we may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses. If we are unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that our products do not meet customer needs or expectations, our reputation, and consequently, our business may be significantly harmed. Business disruptions may adversely affect our operations Our business and operations are highly automated and a disruption or failure of our systems may delay our ability to complete sales and to provide services. A major disaster or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. This possible disruption may materially and adversely affect our future operating results. Our revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate which could materially impact the price of our Common Shares We experience, and we are likely to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results caused by many factors, including:  Changes in the demand for our products and for the products of our competitors;  The introduction or enhancement of products by us and by our competitors; 17 Table of Contents  Market acceptance of enhancements or products;  Delays in the introduction of products or enhancements by us or by our competitors;  Customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products;  Changes in the lengths of sales cycles;  Changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  Delays in product installation with customers;  Change in the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed;  Change in the mix of products and services sold;  Change in the mix of international and North American revenues;  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and LIBOR rates;  Acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses;  Restructuring charges taken in connection with any completed acquisition;  Changes in general economic and business conditions; and  Changes in general political developments, such as international trade policies and policies taken to stimulate or to preserve national economies. A general weakening of the global economy, or economic or business uncertainty created by North American or international political developments, could cancel or delay customer purchases. A cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses or delays in the installation of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular quarter. As a result of the timing of product introductions and the rapid evolution of our business as well as of the markets we serve, we cannot predict whether patterns or trends experienced in the past will continue. For these reasons, you should not rely upon period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast future performance. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly and this possible variance could materially reduce the market price of our Common Shares. Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against Recent events in the financial markets have demonstrated that businesses and industries throughout the world are very tightly connected to each other. Thus, financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or to our industry may adversely affect us over the course of time. For example, material increases in LIBOR or other applicable interest rate benchmarks may increase the debt payment costs for the portion of our credit facilities that we have not hedged. Credit contraction in financial markets may hurt our ability to access credit in the event that we identify an acquisition opportunity or some other opportunity that would require a significant investment in resources. Potential price inflation caused by an excess of liquidity in countries where we conduct business may increase the cost we incur to provide our solutions and may reduce profit margins on agreements which govern our provision of products or services to customers over a multi-year period. Finally, a reduction in credit, combined with reduced economic activity, may adversely affect businesses and industries that collectively constitute a significant portion of our customer base. As a result, these customers may need to reduce their purchases of our products or services, or we may experience greater difficulty in receiving payment for the products or services that these customers purchase from us. Any of these events, or any other events caused by turmoil in world financial markets, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 18 Table of Contents The volatility of our stock price could lead to losses by shareholders The market price of our Common Shares has been subject to wide fluctuations. Such fluctuations in market price may continue in response to: (i) quarterly and annual variations in operating results; (ii) announcements of technological innovations or new products that are relevant to our industry; (iii) changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; or (iv) other events or factors. In addition, financial markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations that particularly affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. These fluctuations have often resulted from the failure of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter, and thus such fluctuations may or may not be related to the underlying operating performance of such companies. Broad market fluctuations or any failure of our operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares. Occasionally, periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities may lead to the institution of securities class action litigation against a company. Due to the volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of such securities litigation in the future. Such legal action could result in substantial costs to defend our interests and a diversion of managements attention and resources, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities We are subject to income and other taxes in a variety of jurisdictions and our tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and of other tax liabilities requires significant judgment. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, and this difference may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
