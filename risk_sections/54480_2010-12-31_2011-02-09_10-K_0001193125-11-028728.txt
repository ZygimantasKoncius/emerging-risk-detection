Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to an Investment in KCSs Common Stock The price of KCSs common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for investors to resell common stock when they want to or at prices they find attractive. The price of KCSs common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), listed under the ticker symbol KSU, constantly changes. The Company expects that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate. The Companys stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond KCSs control. These factors include, but are not limited to:  quarterly variations in operating results;  operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;  changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates by management, securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;  developments generally affecting the railroad industry;  announcements by KCS or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  the assertion or resolution of significant claims or proceedings against KCS;  KCSs dividend policy and restrictions on the payment of dividends;  future sales of KCSs equity or equity-linked securities;  the issuance of common stock in payment of dividends on preferred stock or upon conversion of preferred stock or convertible debt; and  general domestic and international economic conditions including the availability of short- and long-term financing. In addition, from time to time the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of KCSs common stock. KCSs ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock is currently prohibited and KCS does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock in 2011. KCS has agreed, and may agree in the future, to restrictions on its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock. In addition, to maintain its credit ratings, the Company may be limited in its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock so that it can maintain an appropriate level of liquidity or debt. During the first quarter of 2000, the Board of Directors suspended common stock dividends. KCS does not anticipate making any cash dividend payments to its common stockholders in 2011. Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock may have special voting rights if KCS fails to pay dividends on that preferred stock over a stated number of quarters. If dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears for six consecutive quarters (or an equivalent number of days in the aggregate, whether or not consecutive), holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two of the authorized number of directors at the next annual stockholders meeting at which 11 directors are elected and at each subsequent stockholders meeting until such time as all accumulated dividends are paid on the Series D Preferred Stock or set aside for payment. In addition, so long as dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock remain unpaid and for a period thereafter, KCS will not be eligible to register future offerings of securities on Form S-3 or to avail itself of the other benefits available to companies that qualify as well-known seasoned issuers under SEC rules, which could adversely affect KCSs ability to access capital markets and increase the cost of accessing capital markets. Sales of substantial amounts of KCSs common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. As of December 31, 2010, there were 6,948,200 shares of common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the 1991 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan, the 2008 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan and the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 1,706,277 shares of common stock held by executive officers and directors outside those plans, and 6,999,826 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of the outstanding shares of Series D convertible preferred stock. Sales of common stock by employees upon exercise of their options, sales by executive officers and directors subject to compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and sales of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the outstanding preferred stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of KCS common stock. KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a controlling interest in KCS and that could deprive an investor of an opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for shares of KCSs common stock. KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that may delay or prevent unsolicited takeover bids from third parties, including provisions providing for a classified board and supermajority stockholder approval requirements in order to increase the size of the board of directors, abolish cumulative voting, abolish the classification of the Board, or effect certain merger, consolidation or sale transactions. The bylaws provide that a stockholder must give the Company advance written notice of its intent to nominate a director or raise a matter at an annual meeting. These provisions may deprive KCSs stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices. The failure of a bank to fund a request (or any portion of such request) by KCS to borrow money under its existing revolving credit facilities could reduce KCSs ability to fund capital expenditures or otherwise properly fund its operations. The Company and its subsidiaries are in an industry that requires continuing infrastructure improvements and acquisitions of capital assets, necessitating substantial expenditure of cash. KCS has existing revolving credit facilities with multiple banking institutions to provide additional liquidity. If any of the banking institutions that are a party to such credit facilities fails to fund a request (or any portion of such request) by KCS to borrow money under its credit facilities, KCSs ability to fund capital expenditures, fund its operations and pay debt service could be reduced, each of which could result in a decline in the value of a stockholders investment in the Company. The failure of any bank in which the Company deposits funds could reduce the amount of cash the Company has available to pay distributions and make additional investments. Given the developments in the financial markets, financial institutions have additional capital risks. The Company has diversified cash and cash equivalents among several banking institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, only insures amounts up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank. KCS currently has cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured levels. If any of the 12 banking institutions in which KCS has deposited funds ultimately fails, the Company may lose its deposits to the extent they are in excess of $250,000. The loss of the Companys deposits could reduce the amount of cash the Company has available to distribute or invest and could result in a decline in the value of each stockholders investment in the Company. Risks Related to KCSs Business KCS competes against other railroads and other transportation providers. The Companys domestic and international operations are subject to competition from other railroads, particularly the Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) and BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) in the United States and Ferromex and Ferrosur in Mexico, as well as from truck carriers, barge lines, and other maritime shippers. Many of KCSs rail competitors are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than KCS, which may enable rail competitors to reduce rates and make KCSs freight services less competitive. KCSs ability to respond to competitive pressures by matching rate reductions and decreasing rates without adversely affecting gross margins and operating results will depend on, among other things, the ability to reduce operating costs. KCSs failure to respond to competitive pressures, and particularly rate competition, in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operation and financial condition. The railroad industry is dominated by a few large carriers. These larger railroads could attempt to use their size and pricing power to block other railroads access to efficient gateways and routing options that are currently and have historically been available. In addition, if there is future consolidation in the railroad industry in the United States or Mexico, there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the Companys operations. Trucking, maritime, and barge competitors, while able to provide rate and service competition to the railroad industry, are able to use public rights-of-way, require substantially smaller capital investment and maintenance expenditures than railroads and allow for more frequent and flexible scheduling. Continuing competitive pressures, any reduction in margins due to competitive pressures, future improvements that increase the quality of alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which the Company operates, or legislation or regulations that provide motor carriers with additional advantages, such as increased size of vehicles and reduced weight restrictions, could result in downward pressure on freight rates, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A central part of KCSs growth strategy is based upon the conversion of truck traffic to rail. There can be no assurance the Company will succeed in its efforts to convert traffic from truck to rail transport or that the customers already converted will be retained. If the railroad industry in general is unable to preserve its competitive advantages vis-à-vis the trucking industry, projected revenue growth could be adversely affected. Additionally, revenue growth could be affected by, among other factors, an expansion in the availability, or an improvement in the quality, of the trucking services offered by carriers resulting from regulatory and administrative interpretations and implementation of certain provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and KCSs inability to grow its existing customer base and capture additional cargo transport market share because of competition from the shipping industry and other railroads. KCSMs Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and financial condition. KCSM operates under the Concession granted by the Mexican government, which is renewable for up to 50 years, subject to certain conditions. The Concession gives KCSM exclusive rights to provide freight transportation services over its rail lines for the first 30 years of the 50-year Concession, subject to certain 13 trackage and haulage rights granted to other concessionaires. The SCT, which is principally responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, has broad powers to monitor KCSMs compliance with the Concession and it can require KCSM to supply it with any technical, administrative and financial information it requests. Among other obligations, KCSM must comply with the investment commitments established in its business plan, which forms an integral part of the Concession, and must update the plan every five years. The SCT treats KCSMs business plans confidentially. The SCT also monitors KCSMs compliance with efficiency and safety standards established in the Concession. The SCT reviews, and may amend, these standards every five years. The Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations provide the Mexican government certain rights in its relationship with KCSM under the Concession, including the right to take over the management of KCSM and its railroad in certain extraordinary cases, such as imminent danger to national security. In the past, the Mexican government has used such power with respect to other privatized industries, including the telecommunications industry, to ensure continued service during labor disputes. In addition, under Article 47 of the Mexican Railroad Services Law and its regulations, the SCT, in consultation with COFECO, reserves the right to set service rates if it determines that effective competition does not exist in the Mexican railroad industry. COFECO, however, has not published guidelines regarding the factors that constitute a lack of competition. It is therefore unclear under what particular circumstances COFECO would deem a lack of competition to exist. If the SCT intervenes and sets service rates, the rates it sets may be too low to allow KCSM to operate profitably. Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to operate its rail lines, but it does not own the land, roadway or associated structures. If the Mexican government legally terminates the Concession, it would own, control, and manage such public domain assets used in the operation of KCSMs rail lines. All other property not covered by the Concession, including all locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain KCSMs property. The Mexican government will have the right to cause the Company to lease all service-related assets to it for a term of at least one year, automatically renewable for additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican government must exercise this right within four months after revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican government will also have a right of first refusal with respect to certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within 90 days after revocation of the Concession. The Mexican government may also temporarily seize control of KCSMs rail lines and its assets in the event of a natural disaster, war, significant public disturbance or imminent danger to the domestic peace or economy. In such a case, the SCT may restrict KCSMs ability to exploit the Concession in such manner as the SCT deems necessary under the circumstances, but only for the duration of any of the foregoing events. Mexican law requires that the Mexican government pay compensation if it effects a statutory appropriation for reasons of the public interest. With respect to a temporary seizure due to any cause other than international war, the Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations provide that the Mexican government will indemnify an affected concessionaire for an amount equal to damages caused and losses suffered. However, these payments may not be sufficient to compensate KCSM for its losses and may not be timely made. The SCT may revoke the Concession if KCSM is sanctioned on three distinct occasions for unjustly interrupting the operation of its rail lines or for charging tariffs higher than the tariffs it has registered with the SCT. In addition, the SCT may revoke the Concession if, among other things, KCSM is sanctioned on five distinct occasions because KCSM restricts the ability of other Mexican rail operators to use its rail lines; KCSM fails to make payments for damages caused during the performance of services; KCSM fails to comply with any term or condition of the Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations or the Concession; KCSM fails to make the capital investments required under its five-year business plan filed with the SCT; or KCSM fails to maintain an obligations compliance bond and insurance coverage as specified in the Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations. In addition, the Concession would revoke automatically if KCSM changes its nationality or assigns or creates any lien on the Concession, or if there is a change in control of KCSM without the SCTs approval. The SCT may also terminate the Concession as a result of KCSMs surrender of its rights under the Concession, or for reasons of public interest or upon KCSMs liquidation or bankruptcy. Revocation or termination of the Concession would prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would materially adversely affect the Mexican 14 operations and the ability to make payments on KCSMs debt. If the Concession is terminated or revoked by the SCT for any reason, KCSM would receive no compensation and its interest in its rail lines and all other fixtures covered by the Concession, as well as all improvements made by it, would revert to the Mexican government. In April 2006, the SCT initiated proceedings against KCSM, claiming that KCSM had failed to make certain minimum capital investments projected for 2004 and 2005 under its five-year business plan filed with the SCT prior to its April 2005 acquisition by KCS (collectively, the Capital Investment Proceedings). KCSM believes it made capital expenditures exceeding the required amounts. KCSM responded to the SCT by providing evidence in support of its investments and explaining why it believes sanctions are not appropriate. In May 2007, KCSM was served with an SCT resolution regarding the Capital Investment Proceeding for 2004, in which the SCT resolved to impose no sanction. In June 2007, KCSM was served with an SCT resolution regarding the Capital Investment Proceeding for 2005, in which the SCT determined that KCSM had failed to make the minimum capital investments required for such year, and imposed a minimal fine. KCSM filed an action in the Mexican Administrative and Fiscal Federal Court challenging this ruling and on December 21, 2010 received a favorable ruling. The SCT has the right to challenge this ruling. KCSM believes that even if a sanction is ultimately imposed as a consequence of the 2005 Capital Investment Proceeding, there will be no material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. However, if a sanction were to be imposed, it would be considered a generic sanction under Mexican law (i.e., sanctions applied to conduct not specifically referred to in specific subsections of the Mexican railway law). If KCSM is ultimately sanctioned by the SCT for generic sanctions on five occasions over the term of the Concession, KCSM could be subject to possible future SCT action seeking revocation of the Concession. Such revocation would materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. KCSs business strategy, operations and growth rely significantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties. Operation of KCSs rail network and its plans for growth and expansion rely significantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic alliances, as well as interchange, trackage rights, haulage rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and third parties that enable KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage the Company does not own. KCSs ability to provide comprehensive rail service to its customers depends in large part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with other railroads and third parties. The termination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could adversely affect KCSs business, financial condition and results of operations. KCS is also dependent in part upon the financial health and efficient performance of other railroads. For example, some of KCSRs traffic moves over the UPs lines via trackage rights, a significant portion of KCSRs grain shipments originate with another rail carrier pursuant to marketing agreements with that carrier, and the UP is KCSs largest partner in the interchange of total rail traffic. There can be no assurance that KCS will not be materially adversely affected by operational or financial difficulties of other railroads. KCSMs operations are subject to certain trackage rights, haulage rights and interline service agreements with another Mexican rail carrier, some of which are in dispute. Through KCSMs Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM is required to grant short and long distance trackage rights to Ferromex. Applicable law stipulates that Ferromex similarly is required to grant to KCSM rights to use portions of their tracks. These trackage rights have been granted under the Concession. The rates to be charged for use of the Trackage Rights after January 1, 2009 were agreed to by KCS and Ferromex pursuant to the Trackage Rights Agreement, dated February 9, 2010. The Trackage Rights Agreement did not establish rates that may be charged for the right to use the trackage rights for the periods beginning in 1998 through December 31, 2008. If KCSM cannot reach an agreement with Ferromex for rates applicable for services prior to January 1, 2009 which are not subject to the Trackage Rights Agreement, the SCT is entitled to set the rates in accordance with 15 Mexican law and regulations, which rates may not adequately compensate KCSM. KCSM is currently involved in judicial, civil and administrative proceedings and negotiations with Ferromex regarding the rates payable to each other for trackage rights, interline services and haulage rights for periods prior to January 1, 2009. Certain of these disputes continue under litigation. Any resolution of such procedures adverse to KCSM could have a negative impact on its results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year. KCSs debt capitalization ratio (total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity) was 37.7% at December 31, 2010 . KCSs leverage could adversely affect its ability to fulfill obligations under various debt instruments and operate its business. KCSs level of debt could make it more difficult for it to borrow money in the future, may reduce the amount of money available to finance operations and other business activities, exposes the Company to the risk of increased interest rates, makes it more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions, and could reduce flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic conditions. KCSs failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt instruments, which restrict or prohibit many actions, including, but not limited to, KCSs ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, make prepayments of particular debt, pay dividends, make investments, engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell certain assets, engage in mergers and consolidations or in sale-leaseback transactions and require KCS to maintain specified financial ratios, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business or prospects. If the Company does not have enough cash to service its debt, meet other obligations and fund other liquidity needs, KCS may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. KCS cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict the Company from adopting some of these alternatives. The indebtedness of KCSM exposes it to risks of exchange rate fluctuations because any devaluation of the peso would cause the cost of KCSMs dollar-denominated debt to increase and could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage in Mexico, compared to Mexican competitors that have less dollar-denominated debt and greater operating and financial flexibility than KCSM. A downturn in the debt capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing and make financing difficult to obtain, each of which may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and business. Events in the financial markets may have an adverse impact on the debt capital markets and, as a result, credit may become more expensive and difficult to obtain. Lenders may impose more stringent restrictions on the terms of credit and there may be a general reduction in the amount of credit available in the markets in which KCS conducts business. The negative impact of tightening credit markets and adverse changes in the debt capital markets generally may have a material adverse effect on KCSs business and results of operations resulting from, but not limited to, an inability to finance capital expansion on favorable terms, if at all, increased financing costs or financial terms with increasingly restrictive covenants. KCSs business is capital intensive. The Companys business is capital intensive and requires substantial ongoing expenditures for, among other things, additions and improvements to roadway, structures and technology, acquisitions, and maintenance and repair of equipment and the rail system. KCSs failure to make necessary capital expenditures to maintain its operations could impair its ability to serve existing customers, accommodate increases in traffic volumes or result in increased derailments. 16 KCSMs Concession from the Mexican government requires KCSM to make investments and undertake capital projects. If KCSM fails to make such capital investments, KCSMs business plan commitments with the Mexican government may be at risk, requiring KCSM to seek waivers of its business plan. There is no assurance that such waivers, if requested, would be granted by the SCT. KCSM may defer capital expenditures under its business plan with the permission of the SCT. However, the SCT might not grant this permission, and any failure by KCSM to comply with the capital investment commitments in its business plan could result in sanctions imposed by the SCT, and could result in revocation of the Concession if sanctions are imposed on five distinct occasions. The Company cannot assure that the Mexican government would grant any such permission or waiver. If such permission or waiver is not obtained in any instance and KCSM is sanctioned, its Concession might be at risk of revocation, which would materially adversely affect KCSs financial condition and results of operations. See KCSMs Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain circumstances below. KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund capital expenditures with funds from operating cash flows, equipment leases, and debt financing. KCS may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations or obtain sufficient funds from external sources to fund capital expenditure requirements. Even if financing is available, it may not be obtainable on acceptable terms and within the limitations contained in the indentures and other agreements relating to KCSs existing debt. KCS depends on the stability and availability of its information technology systems to operate its business. KCS relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of its information technology systems, including its computer hardware, software and communications equipment, could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures and the inability to protect corporate information assets against intruders or other operational difficulties. Although KCS has taken steps to mitigate these risks, a significant disruption could adversely affect KCSs results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to compete effectively. Additionally, if KCS is unable to acquire or implement new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on KCSs results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. KCSs business may be adversely affected by changes in general economic, weather or other conditions. KCSs operations may be adversely affected by changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight that KCS transports. The relative strength or weakness of the United States and Mexican economies affects the businesses served by KCS. Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets, including the availability of short and long-term debt financing, may affect KCS, as well as the producers and consumers of the commodities that KCS transports and may have a material adverse effect on KCSs results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. PCRC is directly affected by the world economy and trans-Pacific trade flows. In addition, KCSs investments in Mexico and Panama expose the Company to risks associated with operating in Mexico and Panama, including, among others, cultural differences, varying labor, regulatory and operating practices, political risk and differences between the United States, Mexican and Panamanian economies. Historically, a stronger economy has resulted in improved results for KCSs rail transportation operations. Conversely, when the economy has slowed, results have been less favorable. If an economic slowdown or recession occurs in key markets, the volume of rail shipments is likely to be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on KCSs business and financial condition. The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although transportation markets are affected by general economic conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each particular market that may influence operating results. Some of KCSs customers do business in industries that are highly cyclical, including the oil and gas, automotive, housing and agriculture industries. Any downturn in these industries could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Also, some of the products 17 transported have had a historical pattern of price cyclicality which has typically been influenced by the general economic environment and by industry capacity and demand. For example, global steel and petrochemical prices have decreased in the past, and reduced demand for automotive vehicles and related shipments may result in decreased prices. KCS cannot assure that prices and demand for these products will not decline in the future, adversely affecting those industries and, in turn, the Companys financial condition or results. Traffic congestion experienced in the U.S. or Mexican railroad system may result in overall traffic congestion which would impact the ability to move traffic to and from Mexico and adversely affect KCSs operations. This system congestion may also result in certain equipment shortages. Any similar congestion experienced by railroads in Mexico could have an adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. In addition, the growth of cross-border traffic in recent years has contributed to congestion on the international bridge at the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo border gateway, which is expected to continue in the near future. This may adversely affect KCSs business and results of operations. The Companys operations may also be affected by natural disasters or adverse weather conditions. The Company operates in and along the Gulf of Mexico, and its facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods and other extreme weather conditions that could also adversely affect KCSs shipping, agricultural, chemical and other customers. Significant reductions in the volume of rail shipments due to economic, weather, or other conditions could have a material adverse effect on KCSs business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. KCSs business may be affected by market and regulatory responses to climate change. KCSs operations may be adversely affected by restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust. Restrictions on emissions could also affect KCSs customers that use commodities that KCS transports to produce energy, use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities KCS transports, or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities KCS transports, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on KCSs results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain customers and their respective markets for certain commodities KCS transports in an unpredictable manner that could alter traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. Any of these factors, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on KCSs business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. KCS is exposed to the credit risk of its customers and counterparties and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect KCSs business. KCSs business is subject to credit risk including the risk that a customer or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations when due. Customers and counterparties that owe the Company money may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Although the Company has procedures for reviewing its receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Some of the Companys risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by the Company. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one customer or counterparty could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other customers or counterparties, which in turn could adversely affect the Company. The Company may be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default by its customers and counterparties. 18 KCSs business is subject to regulation by international, federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including tax, environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that could require KCS to incur material costs or liabilities relating to tax, environmental, health, or safety compliance or remediation. KCSs failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on its operations. KCS is subject to governmental regulation by international, federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to its railroad operations, including the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and the Secretary of Communications and Transportation in Mexico, as well as a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, and other matters. Government regulation of the railroad industry is a significant determinant of the competitiveness and profitability of railroads. As part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 in the United States, Class I railroad carriers and passenger and commuter rail operators must implement positive train control (a technology designed to help prevent train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into rail work zones, and entry into main line track if a switch is misaligned) at certain locations (including main line track where toxic inhalation hazard or poison inhalation hazard movements occur or where passenger operations occur) by the end of 2015, which will add to operating costs, increase the number of employees the Company employs and require KCS to invest significant amounts of money into new safety technology. KCSs inadvertent failure or inability to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and operations, including limitations on operating activities until compliance with applicable requirements is achieved. These government agencies may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which the Company operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects on the Companys business that occur as a result of such change. Additionally, some of the regulations require KCS to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other authorizations. Any failure to maintain these licenses, permits, and other authorizations could adversely affect KCSs business. KCS is subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and Mexico. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, and revisions of tax regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and operating results. Although KCS believes the tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, claims, or litigation could differ from what is reflected in KCSs income tax provisions and accruals. From time to time, certain KCS facilities have not been in compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that KCS will always be in compliance with such laws and regulations in the future. Environmental liability under federal and state law in the United States can also extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties. Given the nature of its business, the Company incurs, and expects to continue to incur, environmental compliance costs, including, in particular, costs necessary to maintain compliance with requirements governing chemical and hazardous material shipping operations, refueling operations and repair facilities. KCS presently has environmental investigation and remediation obligations at certain sites, and will likely incur such obligations at additional sites in the future. Liabilities accrued for environmental costs represent the Companys best estimate of the probable future obligation for the remediation and settlement of these sites. Although the recorded liability is the best estimate of all probable costs, clean-up costs cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, and may exceed such estimates, due to various factors such as evolving environmental laws and regulations, changes in technology, the extent of other parties participation, developments in environmental surveys and studies, and the extent of corrective action that may ultimately be required. New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, accidental spills, releases or violations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require KCS to incur costs or subject KCS to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on KCSs business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Companys Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including standards for, among other things, water discharge, water supply, 19 emissions, noise pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and solid waste. Under applicable Mexican law and regulations, administrative and criminal proceedings may be brought and economic sanctions imposed against companies that violate environmental laws, and non-complying facilities may be temporarily or permanently closed. KCSM is also subject to the laws of various jurisdictions and international conferences with respect to the discharge of materials into the environment and to environmental laws and regulations issued by the governments of each of the Mexican states in which KCSMs facilities are located. The terms of KCSMs Concession from the Mexican government also impose environmental compliance obligations on KCSM. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on KCSMs results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Failure to comply with any environmental laws or regulations may result in the termination of KCSMs Concession or in fines or penalties that may affect profitability. KCS, as a common carrier by rail, is required by United States and Mexican laws to transport hazardous materials, which could expose KCS to significant costs and claims. Under United States federal statutes and Mexican applicable laws, KCSs common carrier responsibility requires it to transport hazardous materials. Any rail accident or other incident or accident on KCSs network, facilities, or at the facilities of KCSs customers involving the release of hazardous materials, including toxic inhalation hazard (or TIH) materials, could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation, which could have a material adverse effect on KCSs results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. KCSs business is vulnerable to rising fuel costs and disruptions in fuel supplies. Any significant increase in the cost of fuel that is not adequately covered by fuel surcharges, or severe disruption of fuel supplies, would have a material adverse effect on KCSs business, results of operations and financial condition. KCS incurs substantial fuel costs in its railroad operations and these costs represent a significant portion of its transportation expenses. Significant price increases for fuel may have a material adverse effect on operating results. If KCS is unable to recapture its costs of fuel from its customers, operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a severe disruption of fuel supplies resulting from supply shortages, political unrest, a disruption of oil imports, weather events, war, or otherwise, and the resulting impact on fuel prices could materially adversely affect KCSs operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. KCS currently meets, and expects to continue to meet, fuel requirements for its Mexican operations almost exclusively through purchases at market prices from PEMEX Refinanción (PEMEX), the national oil company of Mexico, a government-owned entity exclusively responsible for the distribution and sale of diesel fuel in Mexico. KCSM is party to a fuel supply contract with PEMEX of indefinite duration based on market prices. Either party may terminate the contract upon 30 days written notice to the other at any time. If the fuel contract is terminated and KCSM is unable to acquire diesel fuel from alternate sources on acceptable terms, the Mexican operations could be materially adversely affected. Market fluctuations could adversely impact KCSs operating results as it hedges certain transactions. From time to time, KCS may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to various market risks, including interest rates and fuel prices. While these financial instruments reduce the Companys exposure to changes in market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit the Companys ability to benefit from lower fuel prices or interest rates due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement. The loss of key personnel could negatively affect business. KCSs success substantially depends on its ability to attract and retain key members of the senior management team and the principals of its foreign subsidiaries. Recruiting, motivating, and retaining qualified management personnel, particularly those with expertise in the railroad industry, are vital to operations and 20 success. There is substantial competition for qualified management personnel and there can be no assurance that KCS will always be able to attract or retain qualified personnel. Employment agreements with senior management are terminable at any time by either party. If KCS loses one or more of these key executives or principals, its ability to successfully implement its business plans and the value of its common stock could be materially adversely affected. A majority of KCSs employees belong to labor unions. Strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect operations. The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States and Mexico. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 80% of KCSRs and KCSMs employees were covered by labor contracts subject to collective bargaining. The Company may be subject to, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or work slowdowns as a result of disputes under these collective bargaining agreements and labor contracts or KCSs potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions. In the United States, because such agreements are generally negotiated on an industry-wide basis, determination of the terms and conditions of labor agreements have been and could continue to be beyond KCSs control. KCS may, therefore, be subject to terms and conditions in industry-wide labor agreements that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If the unionized workers in the United States or Mexico were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, if other employees were to become unionized, or if the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, KCS could experience a significant disruption of its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Although the U.S. Railway Labor Act imposes restrictions on the right of United States railway workers to strike, there is no law in Mexico imposing similar restrictions on the right of railway workers in that country to strike. KCS faces possible catastrophic loss and liability and its insurance may not be sufficient to cover its damages or damages to others. The operation of any railroad carries with it an inherent risk of catastrophe, mechanical failure, collision, and property loss. In the course of KCSs operations, spills or other environmental mishaps, cargo loss or damage, business interruption due to political developments, as well as labor disputes, strikes and adverse weather conditions, could result in a loss of revenues or increased liabilities and costs. Collisions, environmental mishaps, or other accidents can cause serious bodily injury, death, and extensive property damage, particularly when such accidents occur in heavily populated areas. Additionally, KCSs operations may be affected from time to time by natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, hurricanes or other storms. The occurrence of a major natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on KCSs operations and financial condition. The Company maintains insurance that is consistent with industry practice against the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of its business, property damage and business interruption due to natural disasters. However, this insurance is subject to a number of limitations on coverage, depending on the nature of the risk insured against. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover KCSs damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, KCS is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future. Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, KCS may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to operations which could have an adverse effect on KCSs financial condition. KCSs business may be affected by future acts of terrorism, war or other acts of violence or crime. Terrorist attacks, such as an attack on the Companys chemical transportation activities, any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect KCSs results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. These acts may also impact the Companys ability to raise capital or its future business opportunities. KCSs rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror, which could cause significant business interruption and damage to KCSs property. In recent years, there have been reported incidents of train-related robberies in Mexico, including incidents involving KCSMs trains and infrastructure. Other acts of violence or crime could also adversely affect the Companys business. 21 As a result, acts of terrorism or war or acts of crime or violence could result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues for KCS. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the applicable coverage currently maintained by KCS could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be adequate to cover losses or may not be available in the future. KCSs ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico subject it to economic and political risks. The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly, Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and state-owned enterprises could have a significant impact on Mexican private sector entities in general and on KCSMs operations in particular. KCS cannot predict the impact that the political landscape, including the recently implemented multiparty rule, will have on the Mexican economy. Furthermore, KCSMs financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be affected by currency fluctuations, inflation, interest rates, regulation, taxation, social instability and other political, social and economic developments in or affecting Mexico. The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. Although Mexico has imposed foreign exchange controls in the past, there are currently no exchange controls in Mexico. Pursuant to the provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of payment difficulties or the threat of such difficulties in the future, Mexico would have the right to impose foreign exchange controls on investments made in Mexico, including those made by United States and Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange control policy could adversely affect KCSs ability to obtain dollars or to convert pesos into dollars for purposes of making interest and principal payments due on indebtedness, to the extent KCS may have to effect those conversions, and could adversely affect the Companys investment in KCSM. This could have a material adverse effect on KCSs business and financial condition. Mexican national politicians are currently focused on certain regional, political and social tensions, and reforms regarding fiscal and labor policies, gas, electricity, social security, and oil have not been and may not be approved. The social and political situation in Mexico could adversely affect the Mexican economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on KCSs business, financial condition, and results of operation. Downturns in the United States economy or in trade between the United States and Asia or Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate would likely have adverse effects on KCSs business and results of operations. The level and timing of KCSs Mexican business activity is heavily dependent upon the level of United States-Mexican trade and the effects of NAFTA on such trade. The Mexican operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets for the products KCSM transports, the relative position of Mexico and the United States in these markets at any given time, and tariffs or other barriers to trade. Downturns in the United States or Mexican economy or in trade between the United States and Mexico would likely have adverse effects on KCSs business results of operations and the Companys ability to meet debt service obligations. In addition, KCS has invested significant amounts in developing its intermodal operations, including the port of Lazaro Cardenas, in part to provide Asian importers with an alternative to the west coast ports of the United States, and the level of intermodal traffic depends, to an extent, on the volume of Asian shipments routed through Lazaro Cardenas. Reduction in trading volumes, which may be caused by factors beyond KCSs control, including increased government regulations in light of recent concerns regarding the safety and quality of Asian-manufactured products, may adversely affect KCSs business and results of operations. Also, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates could lead to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and exports. Although a decrease in the level of exports of some of the commodities that KCSM transports to the United States may be offset by a subsequent increase in imports of other commodities KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any offsetting increase might not occur on a timely basis, if at all. Future 22 developments in United States-Mexican trade beyond the Companys control may result in a reduction of freight volumes or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and commodities KCSM carries. Any devaluation of the peso would cause the peso cost of KCSMs dollar-denominated debt to increase, adversely affecting its ability to make payments on its indebtedness. Severe devaluation or depreciation of the peso may result in disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may limit the ability to transfer pesos or to convert pesos into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely payments of interest and principal on the non-peso denominated indebtedness. Although the Mexican government currently does not restrict, and for many years has not restricted, the right or ability of Mexican or foreign persons or entities to convert pesos into U.S. dollars or to transfer foreign currencies out of Mexico, the Mexican government could, as in the past, institute restrictive exchange rate policies that could limit the ability to transfer or convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other currencies for the purpose of making timely payments of the U.S. dollar-denominated debt and contractual commitments. Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar prices for KCSs securities. Fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates also have an effect on KCSs reported operating results. A devaluation of the peso would cause reported peso-denominated revenues and expenses to decrease, and would increase reported foreign exchange loss due to the Companys net monetary assets that are peso-denominated. Exchange rate variations also affect the calculation of taxes under Mexican income tax law, and an appreciation of the peso would cause an increase in the Companys reported income tax provision and effective income tax rate. Mexico may experience high levels of inflation in the future which could adversely affect KCSs results of operations. Mexico has a history of high levels of inflation and may experience high inflation in the future. During most of the 1980s and during the mid and late 1990s, Mexico experienced periods of high levels of inflation. The annual rates of inflation for the last three years, as measured by changes in the National Consumer Price Index, as provided by Banco de México, were 4.4% in 2010, 3.6% in 2009 and 6.5% in 2008. A substantial increase in the Mexican inflation rate would have the effect of increasing some of KCSMs costs, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. High levels of inflation may also affect the balance of trade between Mexico and the United States, and other countries, which could adversely affect KCSMs results of operations. Risk Factors Relating to Ongoing Litigation KCS is party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions arising in the ordinary course of business including those specifically mentioned below: KCSM is involved in several disputes with the SCT, which if adversely resolved could have a negative impact on its business and operations. On July 23, 2008, the SCT delivered notice to KCSM of new proceedings against KCSM, claiming, among other things, that KCSM refused to grant Ferromex access to certain trackage over which Ferromex alleges it has trackage rights on six different occasions and thus denied Ferromex the ability to provide service to a Mexican subsidiary of a large U.S. Auto Manufacturer at this location. On August 13, 2008, KCSM filed a response to the SCT. On July 15, 2010, the SCT resolved to consolidate these six sanctioning proceedings into a single proceeding, determining that the actions that motivated the underlying claims constitute a single occasion. On August 19, 2010, Ferromex filed an appeal which KCSM considers to be without merit. Management believes that even if KCSM were to be found liable, a single sanction would be imposed and could be challenged in the Administrative and Fiscal Federal Court. A single sanction makes it more likely that any unfavorable resolution will not have a material impact on KCSMs results of operations. 23 KCSM believes it has defenses to the imposition of sanctions for the forgoing proceedings and is vigorously contesting these allegations. KCSM does not believe that these SCT proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. However, if KCSM is ultimately sanctioned by the SCT for generic sanctions on five occasions over the term of the Concession, KCSM could be subject to possible future SCT action seeking revocation of the Concession. Revocation of the Concession would materially adversely affect KCSMs results of operations and financial condition. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
