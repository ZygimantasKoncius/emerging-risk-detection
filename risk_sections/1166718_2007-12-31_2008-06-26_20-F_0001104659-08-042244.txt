D. Risk Factors and under the caption Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). A. Operating Results Overview We are one of the largest Russian manufacturers of dairy and juice products, with sales of $2,438.3 million, $1,762.1 million and $1,394.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our reportable business segments in 2007 were dairy products, beverage products and baby food products. In 2007, the dairy segment accounted for 76.0% of our sales, the beverages segment, which includes juice and bottled mineral water products, accounted for 17.0% of our sales and the baby food segment accounted for 7.0% of our sales. In 2006, the dairy segment accounted for 75.0% of our sales, the beverages segment accounted for 18.4% of our sales and the baby food segment accounted for 6.6% of our sales. Our principal geographic market is Russia, which accounted approximately for 93%, 93% and 92% of our sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. However, we also have production facilities in Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan and acquired a dairy production facility in Georgia in the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2007, our net income increased by 46.8% to $140.0 million from $95.4 million in 2006. Our sales increased by 38.4% in 2007, including year-on-year sales increases of 40.2%, 27.8% and 46.6% in the dairy, beverage and baby food segments, respectively. By volume, dairy segment sales were higher by 18.2%, beverage segment sales increased by 9.8% and baby food sales increased by 31.9% in 2007. The gross margin in the dairy segment decreased slightly to 29.2% in 2007 from 30.5% in 2006 due to a sharp rise in the price of raw milk of 35.7% which was partially offset by selling price increases and a more favorable product mix. The gross margin in the beverage segment increased to 39.8% in 2007 from 35.3% in 2006 despite raw materials cost pressure, driven by continued efficiency improvements and better pricing and discount management in all regions. The gross margin in the baby food Segment increased to 45.1% in 2007 from 43.1% in 2006, driven by a growing share of non-dairy baby food and a decreased share of baby food produced by co-packing in our sales. Our selling and distribution expenses increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 in absolute terms and also as a percentage of sales, from 14.0% to 15.9%. In particular, our marketing, advertising and transportation costs were higher in 2007 in line with our strategy of supporting strong national brands, improving our route-to-market and expanding our geography. Our net income increased 46.8% to $140.0 million for the full year of 2007 from $95.4 million in 2006. Over the past three years, we have been constructing new capacity, modernizing existing capacity and making strategic acquisitions. Our capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) 73 in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $192.7 million, $130.0 million and $75.1 million, respectively. Expenditures for acquisitions of subsidiaries in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $21.8, $137.3 million (exclusive of advances made in 2006 for acquisitions completed in 2007) and $24.3 million (exclusive of advances made in 2005 for acquisitions completed in 2006 but including advances made in 2004 for acquisitions made in 2005), respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had a total of $579.6 million in outstanding debt (consisting of long-term loans, notes payable, vendor financing obligations and $0.7 million of third parties guarantees). Of our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2007, 58.3% was denominated in foreign currency and 41.7% was denominated in rubles.

The dairy business was our largest segment, representing 76.0% of sales in 2007 compared to 75.0% in 2006. Year ended December 31, 2007 % of sales 2006 % of sales (in thousands) (in thousands) Dairy products $ 1,852,458 76.0 $ 1,320,901 75.0 Beverage products 414,117 17.0 324,074 18.4 Baby food 171,753 7.0 117,152 6.6 $ 2,438, 328 100.0 $ 1,762,127 100.0 76 Sales in our dairy segment increased by 40.2% to $1,852.5 million in 2007 from $1,320.9 million in 2006. We sold 1,599.5 thousand tons of dairy products in 2007 and 1,353.5 thousand tons of dairy products in 2006. The average selling price increased by 18.7% from $0.976 per kilogram in 2006 to $1.158 per kilogram in 2007 driven by a favorable sales mix, ruble price increases and ruble appreciation. Our improved dairy sales were driven by our increased presence in the regions of Russia and the CIS, especially in North West and Southern Russia, the addition of new products to our portfolio and further optimization of our product portfolio, the launch of new product lines and increased marketing activities. Sales in our beverages segment increased by 27.8% to $414.1 million in 2007 from $324.1 million in 2006. We sold 490.6 million liters of juice and water in 2007 and 447.0 million liters of juice and water in 2006. The average selling price increased by 16.4% from $0.725 per liter in 2006 to $0.844 per liter in 2007, primarily due to changes in our product mix in favor of higher priced brands and ruble price increases. Sales in our baby food segment increased by 46.6% to $171.8 million in 2007 from $117.2 million in 2006. We sold 87.4 thousand tons of baby food products in 2007 and 66.3 thousand tons in 2006. The average selling price increased by 11.2% from $1.768 per kilogram in 2006 to $1.966 per kilogram in 2007 driven by ruble price increases and ruble appreciation. In 2007, 54% of our sales revenues came from regional Russia and other CIS countries. Regional sales represented 53%, 66% and 24% of dairy, beverages and baby food segment revenues in 2007, respectively. Over a number of years, we have focused on sales growth in the regions through the expansion of our distribution and production capabilities in various regions, as well as certain CIS countries. Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of expenses relating to raw materials (raw milk for dairy and baby food products, concentrates for juices and packaging materials for all products), which accounted for 84.9% and 82.6% of our total cost of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The table below sets forth these costs for both 2007 and 2006: Year ended December 31, 2007 % 2006 % (in thousands) (in thousands) Raw materials $ 1,405,801 84.9 $ 986,477 82.6 Personnel 90,207 5.5 68,464 5.7 Depreciation and amortization 65,879 4.0 50,136 4.2 Utilities 42,554 2.6 29,240 2.5 Goods for resale 7,341 0.4 22,556 1.9 Other 43,097 2.6 37,286 3.1 Total cost of sales $ 1,654,879 100.0 $ 1,194,159 100 Raw material costs increased by 42.5% in 2007. Raw materials increased as a percentage of sales to 57.7% in 2007 from 56.0% in 2006. Raw material costs accounted for 60.3% of dairy sales in 2007 compared to 57.5% in 2006. This was caused by an unprecedented rise in raw milk prices, which outpaced the increases in selling prices. Raw material costs accounted for 44.3% baby food sales in 2007 compared to 41.2% in 2006, owing to the same reason. 77 Raw material costs decreased to 51.4% of beverage sales in 2007 from 55.0% in 2006 due to enhanced cost control measures and centralized procurement, undertaken from 2006. In the dairy segment, 86.3% of our raw material costs were ruble-denominated and 13.7% were hard-currency-denominated in 2007, whereas 83.9% of these costs were ruble-denominated and 16.1% were hard-currency-denominated in 2006. In the baby food segment, 65.5% of our raw material costs were ruble-denominated and 34.5% were hard-currency-denominated in 2007, unchanged as of 2006. In the beverages segment, 21.2% of our raw material costs were ruble-denominated and 78.8% were hard-currency-denominated in 2007, while the majority of our raw material costs were hard-currency-denominated in 2006. Personnel expenses increased by 31.8% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The average number of production personnel increased in 2007 by 2.5% to 11,076 (including Ochakovo, MOLKA, Manros and Surgut dairy plants acquired in the end of 2006) compared to 10,811 in 2006 (excluding Ochakovo, MOLKA, Manros and Surgut) mainly due to increased utilization of manufacturing facilities and production volumes growth in 2007. Depreciation and amortization increased by 31.4% from $50.1 million in 2006 to $65.9 million in 2007, reflecting significant capital expenditures we have been making to increase our production capacity by improving our facilities and overall infrastructure. Utility costs increased in by 45.5% in 2007 due to larger production and warehousing facilities, as well as an increase in production volumes and electricity and gas tariffs. Goods for resale include various dairy products that we purchase from independent producers and resell. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased by 37.9% to $783.4 million in 2007 from $568.0 million in 2006. Our gross margin decreased to 32.1% in 2007 from 32.2% in 2006. Gross margin in our dairy segment decreased to 29.2% in 2007 from 30.5% in 2006 due to the unprecedented rise in raw milk prices. Our raw milk purchase price increased 64.8% year-on-year in ruble terms (77.5% in U.S. dollar terms) in the fourth quarter and 27.7% year-on-year in ruble terms (35.7% in U.S. dollar terms) for the full year 2007. Gross margin in our beverages segment increased to 39.8% in 2007 from 35.3% in 2006. This increase was primarily due to better pricing and discount management which largely offset higher sugar and concentrate costs, and a shift in our product mix in favor of value-added products. As a result, the increase in the average selling price outpaced the increase in cost of sales Gross margin in our baby food segment increased to 45.1% in 2007 from 43.1% in 2006 mainly due to increased selling prices and a shift in our product mix in favor of higher margin, value-added products. Selling and Distribution Expenses Selling and distribution expenses increased by 57.6% between 2007 and 2006. As a percentage of sales, selling and distribution expenses increased to 15.9% in 2007 from 14.0% in 2006. Our selling and distribution expenses in 2007 and 2006 were as follows: 78 Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 (in thousands) Advertising and marketing $ 137,965 $ 76,194 Personnel 83,901 55,955 Shipping and handling 111,228 73,565 Bad debt expense 1,650 3,130 Materials and supplies 11,249 9,369 Warehouse 11,534 10,986 Other 30,326 16,855 Total selling and distribution expenses $ 387,853 $ 246,054 Advertising and marketing expenses increased in 2007 by 81.1% or $61.8 million in absolute terms, and increased by 1.4% as a percentage of sales to 5.7% in 2007 from 4.3% in 2006. The increase in expenses was due to our continued investments into major brand promotions, media inflation on Russias leading national television channels, which, in 2007, exceeded 50% and general increases in marketing costs. Despite this media inflation, we were able to obtain volume discounts and manage the cost increases more effectively. Personnel expenses increased by 49.9% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The average number of employees in our selling and distribution department increased to 5,712 in 2007 (including Surgut, Manros, Ochakovo, and MOLKA dairy plants acquired in late 2006) from 5,355 in 2006 (excluding Surgut, Manros, Ochakovo, and MOLKA dairy plants) mainly due to the development of our branch network in 2007. Our payroll cost per employee increased by 42.1% to $14,689 in 2007 from $10,336 in 2006, mainly due to implementation of a performance based reward system as well as enhancing the quality of our sales force in 2007. Our personnel costs as a percentage of sales increased to 3.4% in 2007 from 3.2% in 2006. Our personnel costs as a percentage of sales increased to 3.4% in 2007 from 3.2% in 2006. Shipping and handling costs, which primarily consist of external transportation costs, increased by 51.2% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Our transportation expenses as a percentage of sales slightly increased to 4.6% in 2007 from 4.2% in 2006. The increase in transportation costs was mainly due to the expansion of our sales volumes in the regions and increased transportation tariffs. In particular, costs for motor transportation, which accounted approximately for about half of the total beverages transportation expenses, increased by 13.0%, despite record fuel prices. We continued to maintain control of our bad debt expenses, which decreased slightly to 0.1% as a percentage of sales in 2007 from 0.2% in 2006. See B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesAllowance for Doubtful Accounts below. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 34.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006, and decreased as a percentage of sales to 7.4% in 2007 from 7.6% in 2006. Our general and administrative expenses in 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 (in thousands) Personnel $ 102,195 $ 78,227 Taxes other than income tax 17,200 12,789 Audit, consulting and legal fees 10,636 10,506 Depreciation 9,512 7,215 Materials and supplies 4,654 2,462 Communication costs 3,647 2,731 Rent 3,278 2,670 Other 29,800 17,881 Total general and administrative expenses $ 180,922 $ 134,481 79 Personnel expenses increased by 30.6%, while the average number of employees decreased to 3,008 in 2007 (including Surgut, Manros, Ochakovo, and MOLKA dairy plants acquired in late 2006) compared to 3,159 in 2006 (excluding Surgut, Manros, Ochakovo, and MOLKA dairy plants). Our average cost per employee increased by 38.5% to $33,978 in 2007 from $24,532 in 2006, due to wage inflation, compensatory payments made during the process of personnel headcount optimization and SAR program implemented for some of our key managers in 2007. Our expenses for audit, consulting and legal services remained approximately flat showing an increase of 1.2% in 2007 compared to 2006. Depreciation expense increased by 31.8% from $7.2 million in 2006 to $9.5 million in 2007, reflecting capital expenditures made to support our expansion into the regions of Russia and the CIS. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased by 97.8% to $0.7 million in 2007 from $31.8 million in 2006. Other operating expenses were unusually high in 2006, due to a one time impairment charge of US$16.3 million to our operating income, partially to cover the writing down of Valdai mineral water facility in beverage business unit and the closing off of a small dairy plant in Novokuibyshevsk in dairy business unit. Operating Income Operating income increased by 37.5% to $214.0 million in 2007 from $155.6 million in 2006, as a result of cost control measures undertaken in the last two years. Our acquisitions made at the end of 2006 also contributed to the improvement of our operating income. As a percentage of sales, operating income remained stable at 8.8% in 2007 as in 2006. Financial Income and Expenses Financial income and expenses comprised the following: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 (in thousands) Interest expense $ 34,988 $ 27,898 Interest income (2,952 ) (4,372 ) Currency remeasurement gains (18,120 ) (10,288 ) Bank charges 2,912 2,070 Other financial expense (income) 23 172 Total financial income and expense, net $ 16,851 $ 15,480 80 Interest expense increased by 25.4% in 2007 compared to 2006. This was mainly due to an increase in our average debt, including a $150 million Loan Participation Notes issued in February 2007. We received interest income of $3.0 million from free cash management in 2007 compared to $4.4 million in 2006. In 2007, we incurred total currency remeasurement gains of $18.1 million, mainly comprised of gains and losses from U.S. dollar-denominated and Euro-denominated debt respectively. For accounting purposes for our hard currency denominated liabilities we used the exchange rates as of December 31, 2007 vs. December 31, 2006. Based on these rates, the US Dollar depreciated by 6.7% against Russian ruble, while EURO appreciated by 3.6%. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 (in thousands) Current provision $ 49,409 $ 48,232 Deferred income tax charge/(benefit) 4,893 (6,672 ) Total provision for income taxes $ 54,302 $ 41,560 Provision for income taxes amounted to $54.3 million in 2007 and $41.6 million in 2006. These provisions comprise current income tax charges of $49.4 million in 2007 and $48.2 million in 2006, and a deferred tax expense of $4.9 million in 2007 and the expense of benefit of $6.7 million in 2006. Deferred tax benefits and charges arise on temporary differences between the bases of computing income under domestic tax principles and U.S. GAAP. In 2007, our effective income tax rate was 27.5% compared to the Russian statutory income tax rate of 24.0% and, in 2006, our effective income tax rate was 29.7% compared to the Russian statutory income tax rate of 24.0%. This decrease in 2007 of our effective income tax rate is primarily driven by an increase in taxable profits accompanied by a decrease in the groups non-deductible expenses as a percentage of sales in 2007, compared to 2006, as well as utilization of losses incurred in previous periods by certain subsidiaries which were merged into Wimm-Bill-Dann OJSC in 2007. Such losses were not deemed recoverable during previous periods. Minority Interest The minority interest reflects the net income and losses of our subsidiaries that are attributable to the minority shareholders in those subsidiaries. In 2007, net income attributable to minority shareholders of our subsidiaries decreased to $2.8 million from $3.2 million in 2006. Net income attributable to the minority interests in the dairy segment was $2.0 million in 2007 and $1.9 million in 2006, respectively. 81 Net Income Net income increased in 2007 to $140.0 million (5.7% of sales) from $95.4 million (5.4% of sales) in 2006, primarily as a result of the increase in operating income explained above, which was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Sales Sales increased by 26.4% to $1,762.1 million in 2006 from $1,394.6 million in 2005. The dairy business was our largest segment, representing 75.0% of sales in 2006 compared to 72.0% in 2005. Year ended December 31, 2006 % of sales 2005 % of sales (in thousands) (in thousands) Dairy products $ 1,320,901 75.0 $ 1,003,604 72.0 Beverage products 324,074 18.4 303,147 21.7 Baby food 117,152 6.6 87,839 6.3 $ 1,762,127 100.0 $ 1,394,590 100.0 Sales in our dairy segment increased by 31.6% to $1,320.9 million in 2006 from $1,003.6 million in 2005. We sold 1,353.5 thousand tons of dairy products in 2006 and 1,195.3 thousand tons of dairy products in 2005. The average selling price increased by 16.2% from $0.840 per kilogram in 2005 to $0.976 per kilogram in 2006 driven by a favorable sales mix, incremental ruble price increases and ruble appreciation. Our improved dairy sales were driven by our increased presence in the regions of Russia and the CIS, especially in Siberian and Southern Russia, the addition of new products to our portfolio and further optimization of our product portfolio, the launch of new product lines and increased marketing activities. Sales in our beverages segment increased by 6.9% to $324.1 million in 2006 from $303.1 million in 2005. We sold 447.0 million liters of juice and water in 2006 and 436.2 million liters of juice and water in 2005. The average selling price increased by 4.3% from $0.695 per liter in 2005 to $0.725 per liter in 2006, primarily due to incremental ruble price increases and ruble appreciation, partially offset by changes in our product mix in favor of lower priced brands. Sales in our baby food segment increased by 33.4% to $117.2 million in 2006 from $87.8 million in 2005. We sold 66.3 thousand tons of baby food products in 2006 and 57.8 thousand tons in 2005. The average selling price increased by 16.3% from $1.520 per kilogram in 2005 to $1.768 per kilogram in 2006 driven by incremental ruble price increases, ruble appreciation and a change in our product mix favoring value-added products. Our improved baby food sales were driven by the addition of new products to our portfolio and increased sales in new regions. In 2006, 67% of our revenues came from sales outside of the Moscow region in other parts of Russia and the CIS. Regional sales represented 71%, 63% and 22% of dairy, beverages and baby food segment revenues in 2006. Over the last years, we have focused on sales growth in the regions through the expansion of our distribution and production capabilities in various regions, as well as certain CIS countries. 82 Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of expenses relating to raw materials (raw milk for dairy and baby food products, concentrates for juices and packaging materials for all products), which accounted for 82.6% and 83.7% of our total cost of sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The table below sets forth these costs for both 2006 and 2005: Year ended December 31, 2006 % 2005 % (in thousands) (in thousands) Raw materials $ 986,477 82.6 $ 836,404 83.7 Personnel 68,464 5.7 50,030 5.0 Depreciation and amortization 50,136 4.2 41,921 4.2 Utilities 29,240 2.5 21,222 2.1 Goods for resale 22,556 1.9 16,724 1.7 Other 37,286 3.1 32,705 3.3 Total cost of sales $ 1,194,159 100.0 $ 999,006 100 Raw material costs increased by 17.9% between 2006 and 2005 but decreased as a percentage of sales to 56.0% in 2006 from 60.0% in 2005, primarily due to the increase in selling prices. Raw material costs as a percentage of dairy segment sales were lower (57.5% in 2006 compared to 62.8% in 2005) because of the increases in selling prices, which outpaced the increase in raw milk prices. Raw material costs as a percentage of baby food segment sales slightly decreased from 44.7% to 41.2% for the same reason. Raw material costs as a percentage of beverages segment sales remained at the level of 55.0% in 2006 and in 2005. In the dairy segment, 83.9% of our raw material costs were ruble-denominated and 16.1% were hard-currency-denominated in 2006, whereas 78.0% of these costs were ruble-denominated and 22% were hard-currency-denominated in 2005. In the baby food segment, 65.6% of our raw material costs were ruble-denominated and 34.4% were hard-currency-denominated in 2006, whereas 67.0% of these costs were ruble-denominated and 33.0% were hard-currency-denominated in 2005. In the beverages segment, the majority of our raw material costs were hard-currency-denominated in 2006 and 2005. Personnel expenses increased by 36.9% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The average number of production personnel increased in 2006 by 10.7% to 10,811 (excluding newly acquired dairy plants, Surgut, Manros, Ochakovo, and MOLKA) compared to 9,766 in 2005 mainly due to increased utilization of manufacturing facilities and the related growth of production volumes in 2006. Production personnel cost per employee increased by 21.3% to $6,212 in 2006 from $5,123 in 2005 (including the dairy farm employees). This was mainly driven by a manning reduction initiative which commenced in the end of 2006, with subsequent compensatory payments reported in 2006, as well as increased salaries in 2006. Depreciation and amortization increased by 19.6% from $41.9 million in 2005 to $50.1 million in 2006, reflecting significant capital expenditures we have been making to increase our production capacity by improving our facilities and overall infrastructure. Utility costs increased by 37.8% in 2006 due to larger production and warehousing facilities, as well as an increase in production volumes and electricity and gas tariffs. Goods for resale include various dairy products that we purchase from independent producers and resell. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased by 43.6% to $568.0 million in 2006 from $395.6 million in 2005. Our gross margin increased to 32.2% in 2006 from 28.4% in 2005. 83 Gross margin in our dairy segment increased to 30.5% in 2006 from 25.2% in 2005 due to enhanced efficiency and increased selling prices and volumes. Despite additional cost control measures undertaken in 2006, gross margin in our beverages segment decreased to 35.3% in 2006 from 36.1% in 2005. This decrease was primarily due to higher sugar and concentrate costs, a shift in our product mix in favor of lower margin products and, as a result, a faster increase of cost of sales than of the average price. Gross margin in our baby food segment increased to 43.1% in 2006 from 38.0% in 2005 mainly due to increased selling prices and a shift in our product mix in favor of higher margin, value-added products. Selling and Distribution Expenses Selling and distribution expenses increased by 28.2% between 2006 and 2005. As a percentage of sales, selling and distribution expenses increased to 14.0% in 2006 from 13.8% in 2005. Our selling and distribution expenses in 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 (in thousands) Advertising and marketing $ 76,194 $ 57,936 Personnel 55,955 47,665 Shipping and handling 73,565 52,995 Bad debt expense 3,130 3,908 Materials and supplies 9,369 10,446 Warehouse 10,986 9,525 Other 16,855 9,515 Total selling and distribution expenses $ 246,054 $ 191,990 Advertising and marketing expenses increased in 2006 by 31.5% or $18.3 million in absolute terms, and increased by 0.2% as a percentage of sales to 4.3% in 2006 from 4.1% in 2005. The increase in expenses was due to our continued investments into major brand promotions, media inflation on Russias leading national television channels, which, in 2006, reached 35% and general increases in marketing costs. Despite this media inflation, we were able to obtain volume discounts and manage the cost increases more effectively. In 2006 and 2005, television advertising expenses represented more than half of our advertising budget. Personnel expenses increased by 17.4% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The average number of employees in our selling and distribution department decreased to 5,355 in 2006 from 5,713 in 2005 due to the development of our branch network in 2006. Our payroll cost per employee increased by 23.9% to $10,336 in 2006 (excluding newly acquired dairy plants - Surgut, Manros, Ochakovo, and MOLKA) from $8,343 in 2005 mainly due to performance based reward system implementation in 2006. Our personnel costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 3.2% in 2006 from 3.4% in 2005. Shipping and handling costs, which primarily consist of external transportation costs, increased by 38.8% in 2006, as compared to 2005. Our transportation expenses as a percentage of sales slightly increased to 4.2% in 2006 from 3.8% in 2005. The increase in transportation costs was mainly due to the expansion of our sales volumes in the regions and increased transportation tariffs. In particular, ruble tariffs for railway transportation, which 84 accounted for more than half of the total beverages transportation expenses, increased by 14.0%, which slightly exceeded inflation. We continued to maintain control of our bad debt expenses, which remained stable at 0.2% as a percentage of sales in 2006. See B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesAllowance for Doubtful Accounts below. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 22.7% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and decreased as a percentage of sales to 7.6% in 2006 from 7.9% in 2005. Our general and administrative expenses in 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 (in thousands) Personnel $ 78,227 $ 61,830 Taxes other than income tax 12,789 13,194 Audit, consulting and legal fees 10,506 5,567 Depreciation 7,215 5,711 Materials and supplies 2,462 3,268 Communication costs 2,731 2,880 Rent 2,670 2,177 Other 17,881 15,015 Total general and administrative expenses $ 134,481 $ 109,642 Personnel expenses increased by 26.5%, while the average number of employees decreased to 3,159 in 2006 compared to 3,478 in 2005. Our average cost per employee increased by 38.0% to $24,532 in 2006 from about $17,778 in 2005 (excluding newly acquired dairy plants - Surgut, Manros, Ochakovo, and MOLKA), due to the hiring of new managers, wage inflation and compensatory payments made during the process of personnel headcount optimization. Our expenses for audit, consulting and legal services increased by 88.7% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the increased restructuring costs, strategic business consulting costs, costs associated with improving professional skills of our employees and general increases in audit-related fees, as well as compliance costs with respect to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Depreciation expense increased by 26.3% from $5.7 million to $7.2 million, reflecting capital expenditures made to support our expansion into the regions of Russia and the CIS. Operating Income Operating income increased by 77.9% to $155.6 million in 2006 from $87.5 million in 2005. As a percentage of sales, operating income increased to 8.8% in 2006 from 6.3% in 2005. As discussed above, the increase in operating income was primarily due to the improvement in the gross margin as a result of cost control procedures. Our major acquisitions also contributed to the improvement of our operating income. 85 Financial Income and Expenses Financial income and expenses comprised the following: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 (in thousands) Interest expense $ 27,898 $ 23,388 Interest income (4,372 ) (1,569 ) Currency remeasurement gains (10,288 ) (1,231 ) Bank charges 2,070 1,983 Other financial expense (income) 172 297 Total financial income and expense, net $ 15,480 $ 22,868 Interest expense increased by 19.3% in 2006 compared to 2005. This was mainly due to the increased interest rate payable on our variable rate 3,000,000 non-convertible ruble notes issued in December 2005, as well as an overall increase in our debt. We received interest income of $4.4 million from free cash management in 2006 compared to $1.6 million in 2005. In 2006, we incurred total currency remeasurement gains of $10.3 million, which comprised of gains and losses from U.S. dollar-denominated notes and Euro-denominated loan respectively. For accounting purposes for our U.S. dollar-denominated notes, we used the exchange rate as of December 31, 2006, which depreciated nominally by 8.5% against the December 31, 2005 exchange rate resulting in a currency remeasurement gains. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 (in thousands) Current provision $ 48,232 $ 27,385 Deferred income tax charge/(benefit) (6,672 ) 3,327 Total provision for income taxes $ 41,560 $ 30,712 Provision for income taxes amounted to $41.6 million in 2006 and $30.7 million in 2005. These provisions comprise current income tax charges of $48.2 million in 2006 and $27.4 million in 2005, and a deferred tax benefit of $6.7 million in 2006 and the expense of $3.3 million in 2005. Deferred tax benefits and charges arise on temporary differences between the bases of computing income under domestic tax principles and U.S. GAAP. In 2006, our effective income tax rate was 29.7% compared to the Russian statutory income tax rate of 24.0% and, in 2005, our effective income tax rate was 47.5% compared to the Russian statutory income tax rate of 24.0%. This decrease in 2006 of our effective income tax rate is primarily driven by an increase in taxable profits accompanied by a decrease in the groups non-deductible expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006, compared to 2005. 86 Minority Interest The minority interest reflects the net income and losses of our subsidiaries that are attributable to the minority shareholders in those subsidiaries. In 2006, net income attributable to minority shareholders of our subsidiaries decreased to $3.2 million from $3.6 million in 2005. Most of the net income attributable to minority interests relate to the dairy segment, which had minority interest in net income of $1.9 million in 2006, while most of minority interest of $3.6 million in 2005 were attributed to Moscow Baby Food Plant. The $0.4 million decrease in 2006 was partially offset by the other minority interest in losses. Net Income Net income increased in 2006 to $95.4 million (5.4% of sales) from $30.3 million (2.2% of sales) in 2005, primarily as a result of the increase in operating income and financial income explained above, which was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense. 87 B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements We need capital to finance the following: · repayment of debt; · capital expenditures, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment; · acquisitions; and · dividend payouts. We anticipate that the repayment of long-term debt including our syndicated loan, capital expenditures and acquisitions will represent the most significant use of funds for several years to come. In 2007, we continued to purchase property, plant and equipment in order to increase production capacity and to improve infrastructure at our new and existing subsidiaries in anticipation of the expected further growth in the Russian economy and rising incomes. Capital Expenditures Our total capital expenditures in 2007, excluding acquisitions, amounted to $192.7 million, including new vendor credits. Capital expenditures in our dairy segment amounted to $134.6 million and related to the improvement of our existing dairy and cheese production facilities, warehouses facilities and quality control procedures for raw milk used in production. Capital expenditures in our beverages segment amounted to $21.5 million and related mainly to the installation of new production lines and other operating equipment at our production sites. Capital expenditures in our baby food segment amounted to $28.2 million and related mainly to the launch of baby food production on Omsk Plant, acquisition of baby food packaging lines on WBD and modernization of our Kursk Baby Food Plant. Our corporate and common capital expenditures, including those relating to IT infrastructure and software, totaled $8.4 million. Our capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, for the period from 2005 to 2007 are set forth in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Total In millions of U.S. Dollars Dairy segment $ 134.6 $ 93.3 $ 59.9 $ 287.8 Beverages segment 21.5 13.5 12.9 47.9 Baby food segment 28.2 19.4 1.8 49.4 Corporate and common expenditures 8.4 3.8 0.5 12.7 Total capital expenditures $ 192.7 $ 130.0 $ 75.1 $ 397.8 As of December 31, 2007, our capital commitments amounted to $66.4 million mainly for construction projects. As of March 31, 2008, we had capital commitments of approximately $54.7 million, primarily for construction projects at our production sites and purchase of equipment. We plan to finance our capital commitments through cash generated by operating activities and additional borrowings. 88 Acquisitions of Subsidiaries and Purchase of Minority Stakes During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we made a number of acquisitions for the total consideration of $21.8 million, $137.3 million and $24.3 million, respectively. The goal of these acquisitions was to expand into new markets, strengthen our operational presence in the regions of Russia and the CIS and to purchase minority stakes. The following table summarizes our acquisitions in the last three years: Direct owner -ship interest acquired, % Acquisition cost (in US$ 000) 2007 Ochakovo Dairy Plant (purchase of minority stake) 4.72 3,312 Obninsk Dairy Plant (purchase of minority stake) 33.51 11,877 Niva Farm 94.62 1,185 Angarsky Dairy Plant (MOLKA) (purchase of minority stake) 13.23 836 Georgian products 100.00 1,100 Acquisition of minority interests in subsidiaries 17.08 2,746 Other various 750 Total $ 21, 806 2006 Ochakovo Dairy Plant 93.74 $ 66,792 Manros 100 51,336 Angarsky Dairy Plant (MOLKA) 83.36 4,908 Surgut Dairy Plant 100 4,536 Wimm-Bill-Dann OJSC (formerly Lianozovsky Dairy Plant) (purchase of minority stake) 0.26 812 Nazarovo Dairy Plant (purchase of minority stake) 30.35 1,982 Moscow Baby Food Plant (purchase of minority stake) 20 6,955 Total $ 137,321 2005 Essentuki Mineral Water Plant at CMW (Caucasian Mineral Water) Ltd 100 $ 5,505 Nazarovskoe Milk OJSC 63.5 5,167 Pervouralsk City Dairy 100 119 Plemzavod Za Mir i Trud OJSC 100 1,689 Zavety Ilicha 99.34 344 Trud 63.5 420 Kursk Baby Food Plant CJSC 100 3,527 Obninsk Dairy Plant 66.3 6,365 Siberian Dairy Plant (purchase of minority stake) 10 1,050 Other various 120 Total $ 24,306 See Item
