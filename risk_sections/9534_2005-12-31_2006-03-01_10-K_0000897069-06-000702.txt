Item 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risk factors described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. We face significant global competition and our market share could decline. Retreaded tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other new and retread tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price, reputation, customer service, and consumer convenience. The relationship between new tire pricing and retread unit pricing has been narrowing, primarily due to retread unit prices increasing at a faster rate than new tires and lower-priced imported new tires entering the market. The narrowing of prices between new tires and retread tires reduces one of the competitive advantages of retread tires, thereby increasing competition. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to reduce costs. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on the success and stability of our franchisees. Our franchisees compete with many other new-tire dealers and retreading operators of varying sizes. If we are unable to maintain the stability of our franchise organization, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. Higher raw material costs may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Raw material costs increased significantly in 2004 and 2005, driven by increases in costs of oil and natural rubber. Market conditions may prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. As a result, higher raw material costs may result in declining margins and operating results. Speedco expansion may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We anticipate strengthening SpeedcoÂ’s success by adding more locations and tire capability. A major component of the expansion is to modify all existing locations and build new locations to include a Bandag designed and developed high-speed tire sales and service capability. As a result, the increased costs associated with the Speedco expansion resulted in declining margins and operating results in 2005 and may continue to result in declining margins and operating results. -10- Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results. We have franchisees in Central America, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia and licensees in Australia and South Africa. These international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including: exposure to local economic conditions, potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States, adverse currency exchange controls, withholding taxes and the withdrawal of foreign investments and earnings, the potential instability of foreign governments, export and import restrictions, and other changes in laws or government policies. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may adversely affect our operating results. The financial condition and results of operation of certain of our operating entities are reported in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. As a result, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected. Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management, particularly Martin C. Carver, our chief executive officer. The loss of Mr. Carver or the services of a significant number of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our continued success is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
