Item 1A. Risk FactorsI. RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE.An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information before deciding to invest in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business. We have attempted to identify below the major factors that could cause differences between actual and planned or expected results, but we cannot assure you that we have identified all of those factors.If any of the following risks actually happen, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.We have only limited assets and will need to raise additional capital before we can expect to become profitable.As of December 31, 2013, we had no revenue sources, an accumulated deficit of $465.3 million and available cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 million. Although we acquired the GCS-100 patent estate in January 2012 for nominal consideration, licensed rights to LJPC-401 and internally developed LJPC-501, the values of these assets are highly uncertain. As a result, we have only limited assets available to operate and develop our business. We are utilizing our existing cash balances to conduct clinical studies of GCS-100 and LJPC-501 and to evaluate whether or not GCS-100, LJPC-501 and LJPC-401 should be developed further. We believe that our current cash resources are sufficient to fund operations through December 31, 2014 however; we expect that we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. In addition, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: •the scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our clinical studies, nonclinical testing, and other related activities; •the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies, of our product candidates and any products that we may develop;•the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;•the cost, timing, and outcomes of regulatory approvals;•the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities; and •the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements that we may establish, including any required milestone and royalty payments thereunder. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and prospects. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations.If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product candidates or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.7Table of ContentsWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable. We have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize one or more of our product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in many areas, including but not limited to: •completing research and nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates; •obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates for which we complete clinical studies;•launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor; •obtaining market acceptance of our product candidates as viable treatment options; •addressing any competing technological and market developments; •identifying, assessing, acquiring and/or developing new product candidates; •negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter; •maintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and •attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. Even if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, or to perform clinical, nonclinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. In cases where we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement at any price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved. Additionally, if we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.The technology underlying our compounds is uncertain and unproven.The development efforts for GCS-100, LJPC-401 and LJPC-501 are based on unproven technologies and therapeutic approaches that have not been widely tested or used. To date, no products that use the GCS-100, LJPC-401 or LJPC-501 technology have been approved or commercialized. Application of our technology to treat chronic organ failure and cancer is in early stages. Preclinical studies and future clinical trials of GCS-100, LJPC-401 and LJPC-501 may be viewed as a test of our entire approach to developing chronic organ failure and cancer therapeutics. If GCS-100, LJPC-401 or LJPC-501 do not work as intended, or if the data from our future clinical trials indicate that GCS-100, LJPC-401 or LJPC-501 are not safe and effective, the applicability of our technology for successfully treating chronic organ failure or cancer will be highly uncertain. As a result, there is a significant risk that our therapeutic approaches will not prove to be successful, and there can be no guarantee that our drug technologies will result in any commercially successful products.Results from any future clinical trials we may undertake may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approvals to market our drug candidates in the United States or other countries on a timely basis, if at all.Drug candidates are subject to extensive government regulations related to development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization. In order to sell any product that is under development, we must first receive regulatory approval. To obtain regulatory approval, we must conduct clinical trials and toxicology studies that demonstrate that our drug candidates are safe and effective. The process of obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays.8Table of ContentsThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may not agree that we have demonstrated that our drug candidates are safe and effective. If our drug candidates are ultimately not found to be safe and effective, we would be unable to obtain regulatory approval to manufacture, market and sell them. We can provide no assurances that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will approve GCS-100, LJPC-401 or LJPC-501, or, if approved, what the approved indication for GCS-100, LJPC-401 or LJPC-501 might be.Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future study results.Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical study process. The results of nonclinical studies and early clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical studies. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical studies. For example, the safety or efficacy results generated to date in clinical studies for GCS-100 do not ensure that later clinical studies will demonstrate similar results. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical studies, and product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical studies. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. We do not know whether any clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain regulatory approval to market our drug candidates.Future clinical trials that we may undertake may be delayed or halted.Any clinical trials of our drug candidates that we may conduct in the future may be delayed or halted for various reasons, including:•we do not have sufficient financial resources;•supplies of drug product are not sufficient to treat the patients in the studies;•patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect;•the product candidates are not effective;•patients experience negative side effects or other safety concerns are raised during treatment;•the trials are not conducted in accordance with applicable clinical practices;•there is political unrest at foreign clinical sites; or•there are natural disasters at any of our clinical sites.If any future trials are delayed or halted, we may incur significant additional expenses, and our potential approval of our drug candidates may be delayed, which could have a severe negative effect on our business.If the third-party manufacturers upon which we rely fail to produce our drug candidates that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our drug candidates.We do not manufacture our drug candidates nor do we plan to develop any capacity to do so. We contract with third-party manufacturers to manufacture GCS-100, LJPC-401 and LJPC-501. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, which include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. The third-party manufacturers we contract with may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us.In addition to product approval, any facility in which GCS-100, LJPC-401 or LJPC-501 is manufactured or tested for its ability to meet required specifications must be approved by the FDA and/or the EMA before a commercial product can be manufactured. Failure of such a facility to be approved could delay the approval of GCS-100, LJPC-401 and LJPC-501.Any of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend any future clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of GCS-100, LJPC-401 and LJPC-501, entail higher costs and result in our being unable to effectively commercialize products.9Table of ContentsOur success in developing and marketing our drug candidates depends significantly on our ability to obtain patent protection. In addition, we will need to successfully preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the rights of others.We depend on patents and other unpatented intellectual property to prevent others from improperly benefiting from products or technologies that we may have developed or acquired. Our patents and patent applications cover various technologies and drug candidates, including GCS-100, LJPC-401 and LJPC-501. There can be no assurance, however, that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will be sufficient to protect us or our technology, or that any current or future issued patent will be held valid if subsequently challenged. There is a substantial backlog of biotechnology patent applications at the United States Patent and Trademark Office that may delay the review and issuance of any patents. The patent position of biotechnology firms like ours is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, and no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims covered in biotechnology patents or the protection afforded by these patents. Additionally, a recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion further limits the scope of patentable inventions in the life sciences space and has added increased uncertainty around the validity of certain patents that have been issued or may be the subject of pending patent applications. We intend to continue to file patent applications as we believe is appropriate to obtain patents covering both our products and processes. However, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of these applications, or that the scope of any issued patents will protect our technology.We do not necessarily know if others, including competitors, have patents or patent applications pending that relate to compounds or processes that overlap or compete with our intellectual property or which may affect our freedom to operate.There can be no assurance that patents will not ultimately be found to impact the advancement of our drug candidates, including GCS-100, LJPC-401 and LJPC-501. If the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any foreign counterpart issues or has issued patents containing competitive or conflicting claims, and if these claims are valid, the protection provided by our existing patents or any future patents that may be issued could be significantly reduced, and our ability to prevent competitors from developing products or technologies identical or similar to ours could be negatively affected. In addition, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that we would be able to develop or obtain alternative technology. Our failure to obtain a license to a technology or process that may be required to develop or commercialize one or more of our drug candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may have to incur significant expense and management time in defending or enforcing our patents.We also rely on unpatented intellectual property, such as trade secrets and improvements, know-how, and continuing technological innovation. While we seek to protect these rights, it is possible that:•others, including competitors, will develop inventions relevant to our business;•our confidentiality agreements will be breached, and we may not have, or be successful in obtaining, adequate remedies for such a breach; or•our trade secrets will otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.We could incur substantial costs and devote substantial management time in defending suits that others might bring against us for infringement of intellectual property rights or in prosecuting suits that we might bring against others to protect our intellectual property rights.10Table of ContentsPatent policy and rule changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. We therefore cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the invention claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending applications, or that we or our licensor were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States prior to March 15, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. After March 15, 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, enacted on September 16, 2011, the United States has moved to a first to file system. The Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO must still implement various regulations, the courts have yet to address any of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. In general, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Because a number of companies compete with us, many of which have greater resources than we do, and because we face rapid changes in technology in our industry, we cannot be certain that our products will be accepted in the marketplace or capture market share.Competition from domestic and foreign biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies and other institutions is intense and is expected to increase. A number of companies and institutions are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals in our targeted areas. Many of these companies are very large, and have financial, technical, sales and distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours. The greater resources of these competitors could enable them to develop competing products more quickly than we are able to, and to market any competing product more quickly or effectively so as to make it extremely difficult for us to develop a share of the market for our products. These competitors also include companies that are conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies in the field of cancer therapeutics. Our competitors may develop or obtain regulatory approval for products more rapidly than we do. Also, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid changes in technology. Our competitors may develop and market technologies and products that are more effective or less costly than those we are developing or that would render our technology and proposed products obsolete or noncompetitive.Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical studies and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Results of our studies could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of undesirable side effects. In such an event, our studies could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny or withdraw approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment, the ability of enrolled patients to complete the study, or result in potential product liability claims. We currently carry product liability insurance in the amount of $3.0 million in the aggregate. We believe our product liability insurance coverage is sufficient in light of our current clinical programs; however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in impairment of our business reputation, withdrawal of clinical study participants, costs due to related litigation, distraction of management’s attention from our primary business, initiation of investigations by regulators, substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants, the inability to commercialize our product candidates, and decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. 11Table of ContentsAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to: •regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product; •regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;•we may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny. If our product candidates are approved, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies, and submission of safety, efficacy, and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authority, requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA, BLA or marketing authorization application, or MAA. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control.Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. We will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. We will have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product’s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. The holder of an approved NDA, BLA, or MAA must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. We could also be asked to conduct post-marketing clinical studies to verify the safety and efficacy of our products in general or in specific patient subsets. If original marketing approval were obtained via the accelerated approval pathway, we could be required to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical study to confirm clinical benefit for our products. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, such regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:•issue warning letters; •impose civil or criminal penalties;•suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;•suspend any of our ongoing clinical studies;•refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;•impose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers’ facilities; or •seize or detain products, or require a product recall. 12Table of ContentsAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. We may not be successful in our efforts to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates. Although a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing, potential approval, and commercialization of our existing product candidates, the success of our business also depends upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following: •our research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates; •we may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;•our product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;•our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;•competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;•product candidates we develop may be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;•the market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;•a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and•a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community, or third-party payors.If any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.If the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.Our estimates of the potential market opportunity for each of our product candidates include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, no independent source has verified such assumptions. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of our potential market opportunity. If the actual market for our product candidates is smaller than we expect, our product revenue may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.13Table of ContentsThe commercial success of any current or future product candidate will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.Even with the requisite approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend in part on the medical community, patients, and third-party payors accepting our product candidates as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:•the efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical studies and potential advantages over competing treatments;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling;•the clinical indications for which approval is granted;•relative convenience and ease of administration;•the cost of treatment, particularly in relation to competing treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;•the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;•publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and•sufficient third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.Even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in nonclinical and clinical studies, market acceptance of the product will not be fully known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of the product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.14Table of ContentsWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.If we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;•federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;•the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Health Care Reform Laws requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and•state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.15Table of ContentsII. RISK FACTORS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO OUR STOCK.We currently have approximately 7.3 million shares of common stock outstanding and currently may be required to issue up to a total of approximately 17.5 million shares of common stock upon conversion of existing preferred stock. Such an issuance would be significantly dilutive to our existing common stockholders.As of December 31, 2013, there were 7,016 shares of Series C-12 Preferred Stock and 3,250 shares of Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. In light of the conversion rate of our preferred stock (1,724 shares of common stock are issuable upon the conversion of one share of Series C-12 Preferred Stock and 285 shares of common stock are issuable upon the conversion of one share Series F Preferred Stock), the presence of such a large number of preferred shares may dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and provide the preferred investors with a sizeable interest in the Company.Assuming the conversion of all preferred stock into common stock at the current conversion rates, we would have approximately 17.5 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, although the issuance of the common stock upon the conversion of our preferred stock is limited by a 9.999% beneficial ownership cap for each preferred stockholder. With approximately 7.3 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this report, the issuance of this number of shares of common stock underlying the preferred stock would represent approximately 59% dilution to our existing stockholders.The price of our common stock has been, and will be, volatile and may continue to decline.Our stock has historically experienced significant price and volume volatility and could continue to be volatile. Market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The following factors, among others, can have a significant effect on the market price of our securities:•significant conversions of preferred stock into common stock and sales of those shares of common stock;•results from our preclinical studies and clinical trials;•limited financial resources;•announcements regarding financings, mergers or other strategic transactions;•future sales of significant amounts of our capital stock by us or our stockholders;•developments in patent or other proprietary rights;•developments concerning potential agreements with collaborators; and•general market conditions and comments by securities analysts.The realization of any of the risks described in these “Risk Factors” could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, class action litigation is sometimes instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could hurt our business, operating results and financial condition.We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings, if any, for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.16Table of Contents
