Item 1A. Risk FactorsAdverse changes in the key end markets we target could harm our business by reducing our sales.We provide products and services to companies that serve the communications networks, computing and storage, multimedia, industrial and semiconductor capital equipment, defense and aerospace, medical, energy and clean technology and automotive industries. Adverse changes in any of these markets could reduce demand for our customers' products or make these customers more sensitive to the cost of our products and services, either of which could reduce our sales, gross margins and net income. A number of factors could affect any of these industries in general, or our customers in particular, and lead to reductions in net sales, thus harming our business. These factors include: •intense competition among our customers and their competitors, leading to reductions in prices for their products and pricing pressures on us;•short product life cycles of our customers' products leading to continuing new requirements and specifications and product obsolescence, either of which could cause us to lose business;•failure of our customers' products to gain widespread commercial acceptance which could decrease the volume of orders customers place with us; and •recessionary periods in our customers' markets which decrease orders from affected customers. We realize a substantial portion of our revenues from communications equipment customers. This market is highly competitive, particularly in the area of price. Should any of our larger customers in this market fail to effectively compete with their competitors, they could reduce their orders to us or experience liquidity difficulties, either of which could have the effect of reducing our revenue and net income, perhaps substantially. Revenue from our multimedia business, which is driven primarily by sales of set-top boxes, could decline as more content is delivered over the internet or through alternative methods and not through set-top boxes, particularly in the U.S. or Europe. In addition, in the case of our defense business, United States budget actions could cause a reduction or delay in orders placed by the government or defense contractors for products manufactured by SCI, our defense and aerospace division. Since such products carry higher margins than many of our other products and services, such a decrease could disproportionately reduce our gross margin and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will not experience declines in demand in these or other areas in the future.Our customers could experience credit problems, which could reduce our future revenues and net income.Some companies in the industries for which we provide products have previously experienced significant financial difficulty, with a few of the participants filing for bankruptcy. Such financial difficulty, if experienced by one or more of our customers, may negatively affect our business due to the decreased demand from these financially distressed customers, the lengthening of customer payment terms, the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us or to purchase inventory we acquired to support their businesses. Customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws. We are subject to risks arising from our international operations. The substantial majority of our net sales are generated through our non-U.S. operations. As a result, we are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which we do business, including: •the imposition of government controls;•compliance with United States and foreign laws concerning trade (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);•difficulties in obtaining or complying with export license requirements; •changes in tariffs;•rising labor costs;•compliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. laws; •labor unrest, including strikes, and difficulties in staffing;•security concerns; •political instability and/or regional military tension or hostilities;•inflexible employee contracts or labor laws in the event of business downturns;•coordinating communications among and managing international operations;17Table of Contents•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•currency controls;•changes in tax and trade laws that increase our local costs;•exposure to heightened corruption risks;•aggressive or lax enforcement of local laws by governmental authorities; •adverse rulings in regards to tax audits; and•misappropriation of intellectual property.Our operations in certain foreign locations receive favorable income tax treatment in the form of tax holidays or other incentives. In the event that such tax holidays or other incentives are not extended, are repealed, or we no longer qualify for such programs, our taxes may increase, which could reduce our net income. Additionally, a portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by, and therefore held in, foreign jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the United States or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our United States operations, we may incur significant taxes to repatriate these funds. We operate in countries that have experienced labor unrest, political instability and strife, including Brazil, China, India, Israel, Malaysia and Thailand and we have experienced work stoppages and similar disruptions in certain foreign jurisdictions. To the extent such developments prevent us from adequately staffing our plants and manufacturing and shipping products in those jurisdictions, our margins and net income could be reduced and our reputation as a reliable supplier could be negatively impacted.We are subject to intense competition in the EMS industry which could cause us to lose sales and therefore hurt our financial performance. The electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry is highly competitive and the industry has experienced a surplus of manufacturing capacity. Our competitors include major global EMS providers such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica, Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., and Plexus Corp., as well as other companies that have a regional product, service or industry-specific focus. We also face competition from current and potential OEM customers who may elect to manufacture their own products internally rather than outsourcing to EMS providers.Competition is based on a number of factors, including price and quality. We may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors for any number of reasons, including the willingness of competitors to provide EMS services at prices we are unable or unwilling to offer. There can be no assurance that we will win new business or not lose existing business due to competitive factors, which could decrease our sales and net income.Consolidation in the electronics industry may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power and increasing prices we pay for components . Consolidation in the electronics industry among our customers, our suppliers and/or our competitors may increase, which could result in a small number of very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics industry. The significant purchasing and market power of these large companies could decrease the prices paid to us by these customers. In addition, if one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide EMS services, we may lose that customer's business. Similarly, consolidation among our suppliers could result in a sole or limited source for certain components used in our customers' products. Any such consolidation could cause us to be required to pay increased prices for such components, which could reduce our gross margin and profitability.We rely on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our sales, and declines in sales to these customers could reduce our net sales and net income. Sales to our ten largest customers represented approximately half of our net sales during 2014. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our sales, particularly in the communications end market. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales or pricing to our largest customers could substantially reduce our revenue and margins. 18Table of ContentsRecruiting and retaining our key personnel is critical to the continued growth of our business. Our success depends upon the continued service of our key personnel, particularly our highly skilled sales and operations executives, managers and engineers with many years of experience in electronics and contracts manufacturing. While we rely on competitive pay packages in order to help attract and retain such personnel, such individuals can be difficult to identify, recruit and retain and are heavily recruited by our competitors. Should any of our key employees choose to retire or terminate their employment with us, and should we be unable to recruit new employees with the required experience, our operations and growth prospects could be negatively impacted.Our strategy to pursue higher margin business depends in part on the success of our Components, Products and Services (CPS) business, which, if not successful, could cause our future gross margins and operating results to be lower. A key part of our strategy is to grow our CPS business, which includes printed circuit boards, backplane and cable assemblies, mechanical systems, memory, defense and aerospace and computing products and design, engineering, logistics and repair services. A decrease in orders for these components, products and services can have a disproportionately adverse impact on our profitability since these components, products and services generally carry higher than average contribution margins. In addition, in order to grow this portion of our business profitably, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our product development capabilities, research and development activities, test and tooling equipment and skilled personnel, all of which reduce our operating results in the short term. The success of our CPS business also depends on our ability to increase sales of our proprietary products, convince our customers to agree to purchase our components for use in the manufacture of their products, rather than directing us to buy them from third parties, and expand the number of our customers who contract for our design, engineering, logistics and repair services. We may face challenges in achieving commercially viable yields and difficulties in manufacturing components in the quantities and to the specifications and quality standards required by our customers, as well as in qualifying our components for use in our customers' designs. Our proprietary products and design, engineering, logistics and repair services must compete with products and services offered by established vendors which focus solely on development of similar technologies or the provision of similar services. Any of these factors could cause our CPS revenue and margins to be less than expected, which could have an overall adverse and potentially disproportionate effect on our revenues and profitability.If we are unable to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise, our business could be adversely affected.Regular improvements to and refinements of our manufacturing processes are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace. As a result, we are continually evaluating the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of new manufacturing processes. In some cases, we must make capital expenditures and incur engineering expense in order to qualify and validate any such new process in advance of booking new business that could utilize such processes. Such investments utilize cash and reduce our margins and net income. Any failure to adequately invest in manufacturing technology could reduce our competitiveness and, potentially, our future revenue and net income. Our operating results and cash generated from operations are subject to significant uncertainties, which can cause our future sales and net income to be variable. Our operating results can vary due to a number of significant uncertainties, including: •conditions in the economy as a whole and in the industries we serve;•fluctuations in components prices and component shortages caused by high demand, natural disaster or otherwise;•timing of new product development by our customers, which creates demand for our services, but which can also require us to incur start-up costs relating to new tooling and processes;•levels of demand in the end markets served by our customers;•our ability to replace declining sales from end-of-life programs with new business wins;•timing of orders from customers and the accuracy of their forecasts;•inventory levels of customers, which if high relative to their normal sales volume, could cause them to reduce their orders to us;•timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales, customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor;•increased labor costs in the regions in which we operate;•mix of products ordered by and shipped to major customers, as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins than more complex and lower volume services;•degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; 19Table of Contents•customer insolvencies resulting in bad debt or inventory exposures that are in excess of our reserves;•our ability to efficiently move manufacturing activities to lower cost regions;•the effects of seasonality in our business;•changes in our tax provision due to changes in our estimates of pre-tax income in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets; and•political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations which could restrict our operations or increase our costs. Variability in our operating results may also lead to variability in cash generated by operations, which can adversely affect our ability to make capital expenditures, engage in strategic transactions, redeem debt and repurchase stock and utilize our borrowing facilities. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our taxes and decrease our net income.We are subject to income, sales, value-added, withholding and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates and liability for other taxes could increase as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, our cash management strategies and other factors. For instance, recently enacted legislation in Mexico could significantly increase our taxes payable in Mexico in the future. In addition, our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities. For example, we are currently undergoing audits of our tax returns for certain recent tax years in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, Thailand, Hungary, Japan and Mexico. Developments in these or future audits could adversely affect our tax provisions, including through the disallowance or reduction of deferred tax assets or the assessment of back taxes, interest and penalties. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and our existing tax reserves are adequate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions, which could lead to an increase in our taxes payable and a decrease in our net income.We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for potential claims and losses, which could leave us responsible for certain costs and damages. We carry various forms of business and liability insurance in types and amounts we believe are reasonable and customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we do not have insurance coverage for all of the risks and liabilities we assume in connection with our business, including failure to comply with typical customer warranties for workmanship, product liability, intellectual property infringement, product recall claims and environmental contamination. In addition, our policies generally have deductibles that could reduce the amount of our potential recoveries from insurance. As a result, not all of our potential business losses are covered under our insurance policies. Should we sustain a significant uncovered loss, our net income could be reduced.Cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions of our IT network and systems could interrupt our operations. We rely on internal and third party information technology networks and systems for worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email communications, among other functions. Despite our business continuity planning, including "redundant" data sites and network availability, our systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. In addition, despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to hacking, computer viruses, the installation of malware and similar disruptions either by third parties or employees with access to key IT infrastructure. Hacking and malware, if not prevented, could lead to the collection and disclosure of sensitive information relating to our customers, employees or others, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage. If we or our vendors are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, our operations could be disrupted, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims by our customers against us relating to loss of their information, the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged and, in the case of our defense business, we could be debarred from future participation in government programs.20Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events. We conduct a significant portion of our activities, including manufacturing, administration and information technology management in areas that have experienced natural disasters, such as major earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and tsunamis. For example, in 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and tsunami and widespread flooding occurred in Thailand. Our insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our customers' products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits and, as a result, may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. For example, our policies have very limited coverage for damages due to earthquake. In addition, such coverage may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. In the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting one or more of our facilities, our operations and management information systems, which control our worldwide procurement, inventory management, shipping and billing activities, could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing for an extended period of time. Any extended inability to continue our operations at affected facilities following such an event could reduce our revenue.Our supply chain is subject to risks that could increase our costs or cause us to delay shipments to customers, reducing our revenue and margins. Our supply chain is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For example, we are dependent on certain suppliers, including limited and sole source suppliers, to provide key components we incorporate into our products. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, delays in delivery and shortages of components, which in turn could result in increased component prices and delays in product shipments to customers, both of which could decrease our revenue and marginsOur components are manufactured using a number of commodities, including petroleum, gold, copper and other metals that are subject to frequent and unpredictable changes in price due to worldwide demand, investor interest and economic conditions. We do not hedge against the risk of these fluctuations, but rather attempt to adjust our product pricing to reflect such changes. Should significant increases in commodities prices occur and should we not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs, our gross margins and profitability could decrease, perhaps significantly. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources in our manufacturing and transportation activities. There has been significant volatility in the prices of energy during the recent past and such volatility is likely to continue in the future. Concern over climate change has led to state, federal and international legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Such initiatives could lead to an increase in the price of energy. A sustained increase in energy prices for any reason could increase our raw material, components and transportation costs. We may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs, in which case our profitability could be reduced.We rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our raw materials and components from our suppliers to us, and to transport our products to our customers. The use of common carriers is subject to a number of risks, including increased costs due to rising energy prices and labor, vehicle and insurance costs, and criminal activity resulting in losses of shipments, delivery delays resulting from labor disturbances and strikes and other factors beyond our control. While we attempt to mitigate our liability for any losses resulting from these risks through contracts with our customers, suppliers and insurance carriers, any costs or losses that cannot be mitigated could reduce our profitability, require us to manufacture replacement product or damage our relationships with our customers.Government regulations, concerning responsible sourcing, such as the Dodd-Frank Act requirements relating to conflict minerals, are increasing. Such regulations could decrease the availability and increase the prices of components used in our customers' products, particularly if we choose (or are required by our customers) to source such components from different suppliers than we use now. Cancellations, reductions in production quantities, delays in production by our customers and changes in customer requirements could reduce our sales and net income.We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and our bookings may generally be canceled prior to the scheduled shipment date. Although the customer is generally liable for raw materials we procure on their behalf, finished goods and work-in-process at the time of cancellation, we may be unable or, for other business reasons, choose not to enforce our contractual rights. As a result, cancellations, reductions or delays of orders by customers could reduce our sales and net income, delay or eliminate recovery of our expenditures for inventory purchased in preparation for customer orders and lower our asset utilization, which could result in lower gross margins and lower net income.21Table of ContentsWe may be unable to generate sufficient liquidity to expand our operations, which may reduce the business our customers and vendors are able to do with us; we could experience losses if one or more financial institutions holding our funds or other financial counterparties were to fail.Our liquidity is dependent on a number of factors, including profitability, business volume, inventory requirements, the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, the degree of alignment of payment terms from our suppliers with payment terms granted to our customers, investments in facilities and equipment, acquisitions, repayments of our outstanding indebtedness and availability under our asset-backed line of credit. In the event we need additional or desire additional capital to expand our business, make acquisitions, repay additional debt or repurchase stock, there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could cause our stock price to fall and reduce our customers' and vendors' willingness to do business with us.A principal source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which are held with various financial institutions. Although we distribute such funds among a number of financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become insolvent in the future, in which case all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost. Similarly, if one or more counterparties to our foreign currency hedging, insurance or other financial instruments were to fail, we could suffer losses and our hedging of risk could become less effective. Our credit arrangements contain covenants which may adversely impact our business and the failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable. Other than our $40 million Secured Debt due 2015, our debt agreements do not contain financial covenants currently applicable to us, but do include a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets, paying dividends and redeeming or repurchasing capital stock and debt, subject to certain exceptions. Our $40 million Secured Debt due 2015 requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio during its term. Collectively, these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other transactions, including refinancing our existing debt. In addition, such agreements include covenants requiring, among other things, that we file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC, comply with all laws, pay all taxes and maintain casualty insurance. If we are not able to comply with all of these covenants, for any reason, some or all of our outstanding debt could become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under our asset-backed credit facility would not be allowed, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business. Customer requirements to transfer business may increase our costs.Our customers sometimes require that we transfer the manufacturing of their products from one facility to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. These transfers have resulted in increased costs to us due to facility downtime, less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing capacity and delays and complications related to the transition of manufacturing programs to new locations. These transfers could require us to close or reduce operations at certain facilities and, as a result, we may incur in the future significant costs for the closure of facilities, employee severance and related matters. We may be required to relocate additional manufacturing operations in the future and, accordingly, we may incur additional costs that decrease our net income. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses and reduce our net income. If we manufacture or design defective products, or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, we could be subject to claims, damages and fines and lose customers.We manufacture products to our customers' specifications, and in some cases our manufacturing processes and facilities need to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, many of the medical products that we manufacture, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them must comply with standards established by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, our customers' products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we design or manufacture may at times contain design or manufacturing defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or may not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Defects in the products we design or manufacture may result in product recalls, warranty claims by customers, including liability for repair costs, delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. For example, a customer has asserted that we are liable for certain costs relating to the loss of use of products manufactured by us. Although we believe this claim is unsubstantiated, the total costs sought by the customer could be significant. The failure of the products that we design or manufacture or of our manufacturing processes and facilities to 22Table of Contentscomply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing program or facility. In addition, these defects may result in product liability claims against us. The magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical, automotive, defense and aerospace, and oil and gas manufacturing services because defects in these types of products can result in death or significant injury to end users of these products or environmental harm. Even if our customers are contractually responsible for defects in the design of a product, we could nonetheless be named in a product liability suit over such defects and could be required to expend significant resources to defend ourselves.The design services that we provide can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face when providing our regular manufacturing services. For example, we have increased exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries caused by defects in products we design, as well as potential claims that products we design infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and, regardless of their merits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve. Any such costs and damages could be significant and could reduce our net income. We are subject to a number of U.S. governmental procurement rules and regulations, the failure to comply with which could result in damages or reduction of future revenue. We are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. Such laws and regulations govern, among other things, price negotiations, cost accounting standards and other aspects of performance under government contracts. These rules are complex and our performance under them is subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other government regulators. If an audit or investigation reveals a failure to comply with regulations or other improper activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions by either the government or the prime customer, including termination of the contract, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of these actions could increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as a reliable government supplier.We can experience losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which could reduce our net income. Because we manufacture and sell a substantial portion of our products abroad, our operating costs, and in some cases, our revenue, can be negatively impacted due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in volatile currencies to which we are exposed, such as the Euro, Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Chinese Renminbi and Brazilian real. We use financial instruments, primarily short-term foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency commitments arising from accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations. However, the success of our foreign currency hedging activities depends largely upon the accuracy of our forecasts of future sales, expenses, capital expenditures and monetary assets and liabilities. As such, our foreign currency hedging program may not fully cover our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not successful, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates, which could be significant and which could decrease our net income. Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could adversely affect our business by causing us to pay significant amounts for cleanup of hazardous materials or for damages or fines. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes in the ordinary course of our manufacturing operations. If we violate environmental laws or if we occupy or occupied in the past a site at which a predecessor company caused contamination, we may be held liable for damages and the costs of remedial actions. Although we estimate and regularly reassess our potential liability with respect to violations or alleged violations and accrue for such liability, we cannot assure you that our accruals will be sufficient. Any increase in existing reserves or establishment of new reserves for environmental liability could reduce our net income. Our failure or inability to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could also limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations.Primarily as a result of certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These liabilities include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites. The time required to perform environmental remediation can be lengthy and there can be no assurance that the scope, and therefore cost, of these activities will not increase as a result of the discovery of new contamination or contamination on adjoining landowner's properties or the adoption of more stringent regulatory standards covering sites at which we are currently performing remediation activities. 23Table of ContentsAlthough liabilities for treatment and disposal activities have not materially affected our financial condition to date, we cannot assure you that past disposal activities will not result in liability that will materially affect us in the future, nor can we provide assurance that we do not have environmental exposures of which we are unaware and which could adversely affect our future operating results. Over the years, environmental laws have become, and in the future may continue to become, more stringent, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We operate in several environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of government authorities, business and environmental groups. Changes in or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, permitting requirements and material storage or handling could require a higher than anticipated level of remediation activities, operating expenses and capital investment or, depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors, costly plant relocation.We may not be successful in implementing and integrating strategic transactions or in divesting assets or businesses, which could harm our operating results; goodwill and other assets, if impaired, could lead to a non-cash charge to earnings. From time to time, we may undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers and new end markets, to obtain new manufacturing and service capabilities and technologies, to enter new geographic manufacturing locations, to lower our manufacturing costs and improve our profits, and to further develop existing customer relationships. Strategic transactions involve a number of risks, uncertainties and costs, including, integrating acquired operations and businesses, incurring severance and other restructuring costs, diverting management attention, maintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and terminating unfavorable relationships, losing key employees, integrating the systems of acquired operations into our management information systems and satisfying the liabilities of acquired businesses, including liability for past violations of law and material environmental liabilities. Any of these risks could cause our strategic transactions not to be ultimately profitable. In addition, we may be required to record goodwill in connection with future acquisitions. We evaluate, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of our goodwill may no longer be recoverable. Should we determine in the future that our goodwill has become impaired, an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary, which could be significant. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or infringe, or are alleged to infringe, upon intellectual property of others, we could be required to pay significant amounts in costs or damages. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. However, a number of our patents covering certain aspects of our manufacturing processes or products have expired or will expire in the near future. Such expirations reduce our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use or sell similar technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. We are also subject to the risk that current or former employees violate the terms of their proprietary information agreements with us. Should a key current or former employee use or disclose any of our or our customers' proprietary information, we could become subject to legal action by our customers or others, our key technologies could become compromised and our ability to compete could be adversely impacted.In addition, we may become involved in administrative proceedings, lawsuits or other proceedings if others allege that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. If successful, such claims could impair our ability to collect royalties or license fees or could force us or our customers to stop producing products that use the challenged intellectual property, obtain a license to the relevant technology or redesign those products or services so as not to use the infringed technology, which could be quite costly.We sometimes design products on a contract basis or jointly with our customers. In these situations, we may indemnify our customer against liability caused by claims that the design infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Such indemnification claims could require us to assume the defense of such a claim, the cost of which could be significant. Any of these results could reduce our revenue, increase our costs and reduce our net income and could damage our reputation with our customers. In addition, any type of intellectual property lawsuit, whether initiated by us or a third party, could likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management's time and attention.24Table of ContentsChanges in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations; there are inherent limitations to our system of internal controls; changes in securities laws and regulations have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, our operating costs. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of those assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period. A change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced. For example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been enacted and will begin to apply to us in fiscal 2018. We could incur significant costs to implement these new rules, including costs to modify our IT systems. In addition, accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business, particularly rules relating to lease accounting, are under review or being revised. Changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. In addition, the anticipated convergence of U.S. GAAP and international financial reporting standards creates uncertainty as to the financial accounting policies and practices we will need to adopt in the future.Our system of internal and disclosure controls was designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been or will be detected. As a result, there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors, theft and fraud, or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner. Further, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) has introduced changes to the manner in which our system of internal control over financial reporting must be administered, which may increase the costs and management attention that must be devoted to documenting, maintaining and auditing our internal controls.Finally, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, SEC rulemaking and stockholder advisory group policies. As a result, the number of rules and regulations applicable to us may increase, which could also increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to compliance activities. Increasing regulatory burdens could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers in light of an increase in actual or perceived workload and liability for serving in such positions.
