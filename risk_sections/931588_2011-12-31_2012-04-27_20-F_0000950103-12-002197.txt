D. Risk factors In addition to the information contained in this annual report, prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this annual report. Provida’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The economic situation in Chile significantly affects Provida’s results The main source of Provida’s revenues from operations comes from the monthly fees charged to its contributors for mandatory contributions made in their individual capitalization accounts, which are compulsory for every salaried worker as long as there is a labor contract in force. These represented 90.5% of the total revenues from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. As a result, the economic situation in Chile related to activity indicators and employment conditions significantly affects the Company’s results. Macroeconomic conditions affect the financial capacity of employers and/or entrepreneurs, which might produce a drop in the number of employee contributors or a lack of capacity for creating new jobs, and decrease the salary of workers. Therefore, both variables—number of employee contributors and average salary—determine the salary base 8 Table of Contents of the contributors and affect the Company’s results. An increase in the unemployment rate negatively affects Provida’s results and, depending on its magnitude, the impact could be significant. Additionally, Provida’s financial condition and operations results could also be adversely affected by changes in the economic policies implemented by the Chilean Government, political or economic developments in Chile or those affecting Chile. Changes in development of the Chilean economy could adversely affect Provida’s ability to develop its business strategy. It is important to note that another factor affecting the country's economy and thus, Provida's results, relate to natural disasters that might occur in Chile, (i.e. an earthquake, such as the one that occurred on February 27, 2010) if they affect the unemployment level in the country. Pension funds are global investors, which are affected by the economies of neighboring countries as well as by worldwide economic development Pension funds, such as those managed by Provida, are global investors and are therefore affected by both the economies of neighboring countries as well as by worldwide economic factors. In recent years, pension fund returns have been subject to volatility in international and local financial markets, where foreign investments represented 37.2% of Provida’s total assets under management for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Pension Reform Law increased the percentage of investments which AFPs are allowed to make abroad, from a range between 30% to 45% to a range between 30% to 60% during the first twelve months following the enactment of the Pension Reform Law (from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009); and between 30% to 80% since the thirteenth month (October 1, 2009). In September 2008, the Central Bank gradually increased the maximum investments limits abroad: 45% from October 1, 2008, 50% from December 1, 2008, 55% from April 1, 2009 and 60% from August 3, 2009. In November 2010, the Central Bank increased again the maximum global investment limit abroad from 60% to 80%, gradually increasing as follows: 65% from December 1, 2010, 70% from March 1, 2011, 75% from June 1, 2011 and 80% from September 1, 2011. Such increase permits pension funds to have new investment opportunities, which could improve the diversity of their investment portfolios, but at the same time increases the potential exposure to the international markets of the total assets managed by the AFPs. The worldwide economy could affect Provida’s returns obtained on mandatory investments and therefore its net profit. Provida’s returns on its investments in foreign companies could be affected by changes in the regulatory environment, the exchange rates and the economic situation of the countries where such companies are located Provida through its subsidiary Provida Internacional S.A. (“Provida Internacional”) maintains equity interests in private pension fund administrators operating in Peru, Ecuador and Mexico, whose results represented in the aggregate MCh$9,092 (MUS$17.5) of Provida’s net profit for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company is exposed to risks of exchange rate and market performances in those countries where it holds equity interest in companies that administrate pension funds. Likewise, an adverse fluctuation in the exchange rate between the currencies of such countries and the Chilean peso could negatively affect the profits from foreign companies and thus, their respective returns. Additionally, the risks associated with the performances of pension markets where such companies participate, as the pension systems are highly regulated, refer to possible changes in the legal framework and to the economic situation where the companies are, since there is high correlation between their profits and the conditions of activity and employment of the respective country. 9 Table of Contents Provida has limitations on significantly increasing its market position According to official statistics released by the Superintendency of Pensions, Provida has maintained a leading position in the private pension system since its incorporation, which has led to a market share around 40% in terms of number of participants and nearly 30% in terms of assets under management. Given its position in this market and its relative size, it is highly probable that competitors will take steps toward attracting participants from Provida and persuading them to transfer their funds and make contributions to other AFPs, limiting Provida from significantly increasing its market share. A decrease in Provida’s participant portfolio could have a negative impact on its revenues from operations. Provida is limited in its ability to improve the performance of its assets under management Provida’s assets under management totaling MCh$20,380,274 (US$39.2 billion) as of December 31, 2011 are very large with respect to the size of the local capital market measured by its total capitalization. The latter reduces Provida’s flexibility to significantly modify its portfolio structures, and consequently to improve the return offered to its participants. Additionally, in situations of instability or uncertainty in the markets, Provida’s reactive capacity is likely to be limited. In this context, Provida cannot ensure that it will be able to maintain a sufficient rate of return on its pension funds to decrease the number of participant transfers. Any decrease in Provida’s participant portfolio could have a negative impact on its revenues from operations. Additionally, if pension fund returns managed by Provida do not achieve the legal minimum return established by law, due to any instability or uncertainty in capital markets as described above, the Company could lose part of its mandatory investments aimed at covering this difference. (See “Item 4. Information on Provida—B. Business overview—Principal activities—Investment services of participants’ contributions in the pension funds”). This portion must be replenished in a maximum term of 15 days to fulfill the legal requirement to maintain a reserve equal to 1% of the value of each pension fund under management and to continue with its business with the consequent reduction in the Company’s equity. Provida operates in a regulated market in which its flexibility to manage its business is limited Provida’s operations are regulated by the Pension Law and, to the extent applicable, Chilean corporation law. The Pension Law defines the scope of the business of pension fund administrators, which only permits Provida to engage in the administration of its pension funds and the rendering of related benefits. Provida is also authorized to establish local related corporations that may complement its line of business or invest in pension fund administrators or entities located in other countries whose business is related to pension matters. Regarding pension fund investments, Provida must invest such assets in accordance with the types of instruments and within the ranges of assets and maximum percentages allocated per investment and fund type authorized by the Pension Law. In addition, the Pension Law requires each AFP to maintain a minimum reserve fund known as mandatory investment equal to 1% of the value of each pension fund under management in order to provide a minimum real return on investment for each of its pension funds. This minimum return is based on a weighted average of the real return by all pension funds in the AFP system in a 36-month period. This requirement has been designated in accordance with different portfolio compositions, giving those with a higher component of variable income and therefore higher volatility (funds Type A and B), a larger margin to achieve the requirement. If a fund’s real return for a certain month were lower than the minimum return, the AFP must cover the difference within a 5-day period. To do so, the AFP is permitted to apply funds from the mandatory investments, and in that event, such amount must be refunded within 15 days. In accordance with the Pension Law, if an AFP fails to comply with either the minimum return requirement or the minimum reserve fund requirement, it may eventually be required to be dissolved. See “Item 4. Information on Provida—B. Business overview—Principal activities—Investment services of participants’ contributions in the pension funds”. The Pension Reform Law increased the investment limits for the pension funds. However, Provida cannot ensure that it will be able to fulfill minimum return requirements or the minimum reserve. 10 Table of Contents Provida’s business and results of operations may be affected by changes in laws, regulations or Chilean Government proposals On January 16, 2008, the Pension Reform Law to the private pension system was approved and was published as the Republic Law (N° 20,255) in the Official Gazette on March 17, 2008. The first changes started to be implemented on July 1, 2008. Changes introduced by the reform can be summarized in four areas: coverage improvement, new industrial organization, investments and new institutional framework. As a result of the implementation of the Pension Reform Law, there is an important new factor influencing the Company’s ability to capture new affiliations that enter the pension system. The generation of accounts related to new participants entering the system is awarded every two years, beginning in July 2010 and for a 24 month period, to the AFP offering the lowest variable fee. This fee must be lower than the lowest fee operating in the industry and must apply to the AFP’s entire portfolio, not only to the awarded portion. Provida’s management believes that the approved reform consolidates the current private pension system and provides an adequate legal framework for AFPs to continue developing their activities. In reference to the coverage improvement, Provida believes that this implies a new business opportunity for AFPs. Regarding the new industrial organization aimed at increasing competition and reducing entrance barriers, Provida has the support of the BBVA Group, which has a leading position in the Latin American pensions market, as well as a competitive advantage in successfully facing the new conditions in the industry. Additionally, Provida believes that the flexibility of investment alternatives makes increased competition possible. However, future changes in laws or regulations in Chile may have a negative effect on Provida’s financial results. The risk of a higher casualty rate and the consequent effect on expenses from operations is subject to the fluctuation of interest rates for life annuities and the returns achieved by pension funds. In terms of expenses from operations, life and disability insurance has represented an important source of expenditures for the Company. Life and disability insurance is considered a long-term obligation because the benefits to disabled participants are rendered following the final disability determination test, which is three years after the initial disability determination (in the case of partial disability defined as a decrease between one half and two thirds of the working capacity). Until October 2009, the total disability benefits (in the case of total disability, defined as a decrease in more than two thirds in the working capacity) were also granted three years after the initial disability determination. Before the changes introduced by the Pension Reform Law that included the bidding process of the life and disability insurance by all the AFPs in July 2009 (see “Item 3. Key Information—Recent Regulatory Changes”), Provida by law was obligated to provide life and disability benefits by individually contracting an insurance in order to comply with such obligation. Even though, the Pension Reform Law eliminated the AFP’s individual obligation regarding the coverage of casualties beginning on July 1, 2009, by awarding the life and disability administration to a group of insurers, the obligation of those casualties pending payment due to temporary disability under coverage as of June 30, 2009, will remain in Provida. At the moment that the final disability determination is made, the AFP is obligated to cover any shortfall equivalent to the difference between a participant’s savings in his/her individual capitalization account and the benefits granted to him/her by law. These benefits relate to the present value of the life annuity pension discounted by the life annuity rates in force at the time of the payment. Such pension will be equivalent to a percentage of the participant’s average taxable remuneration for the last ten years depending on the decrease of his/her working capacity: i.e., 50% of his/her taxable income in case of experiencing a loss of between one-half and two-thirds of working capacity, and 70% of his/her taxable income in case of experiencing a loss of more than two-thirds of working capacity. As a result, changes in interest rates impact the final value of an AFP’s payment obligations. According to the insurance contract still in force maintained by Provida with BBVA Seguros de Vida entered into before the Pension Reform Law implementation, the Company has the obligation to make additional premium payments if the casualty costs are greater than the temporary payments and up to a maximum amount previously 11 Table of Contents defined. The risk of a greater casualty cost and its consequent effect in the Company’s expenses from operations is subject beginning on July 1, 2009 to the returns of life annuities and pension funds, factors that have an inverse relationship in the economic cost of casualties, therefore, the Administrator could be forced to pay additional contributions if the evolution of such factors so determine. Provida requested BBVA Seguros de Vida, in conformity with the new regulation, to value reserves at the prevailing interest market instead of an historical interest rate (defined as the minimum interest rate of the previous semester) so that the Company’s liability would more accurately reflect the amount that will be effectively paid (i.e. fair value). Moreover, by mutual consent of the parties (previous compensation to the insurer for change in conditions) the financial performance of cash flows surplus was modified with a benchmark determined by assets of similar duration to that of the insurance liability. In view of changes made in the management of assets and liabilities associated with the life and disability insurance, AFP Provida has mitigated the risk associated with interest rate fluctuation. Finally, the Company continues recording its obligations for this concept at fair value in accordance with the casualty model that considers the future evolution of relevant variables under conservative scenarios, which might include constituting higher provisions than those required by law that correspond to the surplus of the insurers’ balance sheets. In view of the low interest rates expected at the moment of payment of the obligations and also applied in the casualty model, Provida has recorded a credit in its provisions for unfavorable casualty rate by MCh$2,696 as of December 31, 2011. Provida is exposed to the credit risk of the insurers such that the risk of failure of an insurer to pay any required shortfall amount is borne by Provida Under the Pension Reform Law, the Pension Fund Administrators together must purchase insurance for their affiliates, called life and disability insurance (SIS). The right to provide such insurance is awarded through a bidding process, which is carried out by all AFPs. In the case of bankruptcy of all involved insurance companies, the State guarantees the necessary additional contributions to complete the required amount to finance the life and disability pension through the State guarantee. The coverage of such guarantee is from 100% of the prevailing minimum pension and 75% over the excess of the pension with a maximum of UF 45 per month (MCh$1 approximately) for each beneficiary or pensioner.
