ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business We are subject to the risks associated with operating in an evolving market. As a company operating in the rapidly evolving PRC Internet market, we face numerous risks and uncertainties. Some of these risks relate to our ability to:  continue to attract users to remain with us and use our products and services as one of the primary means of surfing the Internet switches from traditional PCs to mobile phones or other portable devices;  continue to attract a large audience to our matrices of Chinese language content and services by expanding the type and technical sophistication of the content and services we offer;  develop a sufficiently large advertiser base for our brand advertising and search and search-related businesses;  maintain and attract online game users by periodically updating our existing online games and developing and launching new online games;  increase the revenues derived from our fee-based services and products we offer online;  build our Sohu Media Portal, Sohu Video, Focus, search and search-related, online game and other businesses successfully; 42 Table of Contents  attract and retain qualified personnel; and  effectively control our increased costs and expenses as we expand our business. Our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may differ from market expectations. Our annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past, and may vary significantly in the future, due to a number of factors which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our online advertising revenue often fluctuates as our advertisers adjust their online marketing spending as their industries go through business and economic cycles. We rely on third-party providers for high-quality news, video, audio and text content in order to make our Internet platforms, which include our Websites and our applications optimized for mobile devices, or Mobile Apps, more attractive to users and advertisers. In recent years, video content costs escalated sharply and adversely affected our operating results. Sogou incurred substantial traffic acquisition costs for leveraging traffic from Sogou Website Alliance members Websites to expand distribution of our advertisers promotional links or advertisements. If traffic acquisition costs increase sharply, Sogous operating results may be adversely affected. A significant portion of our online game revenue is attributable to Changyous PC game TLBB; however, the popularity of PC games continues to decline as game players increasingly switch to mobile devices to access online games. Despite Changyous efforts to improve TLBB, our game players have nevertheless lost interest in it over time and TLBBs popularity, revenues and profitability have continued to decline. If Changyou fails to improve and update TLBB on a timely basis, or if Changyous competitors introduce more popular games, including mobile games, catering to Changyous game-player base, the decline in TLBBs popularity can be expected to accelerate, which could cause a significant decrease in our revenues. Changyou made significantly increased expenditures for sales and marketing during 2013 and 2014, mainly for the promotion of its platform channel business. However, Changyou determined that its efforts were not successful, and it is unlikely that Changyou will be able to recoup those expenses. We depend on Changyous online games, and on Changyous PC game TLBB and mobile game TLBB 3D in particular, for a significant portion of our revenues, net income, and operating cash flow, and TLBBs popularity has been declining recently. We rely on Changyous online games, and on Changyous PC Game TLBB and mobile game TLBB 3D in particular, for a significant portion of our revenues, net income and operating cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 25% of our total revenues and 76% of our online game revenues were derived from TLBB and TLBB 3D. If Changyous online game revenues from games other than TLBB and TLBB 3D do not grow, or if they decrease, our revenues, net income and cash flows will be adversely affected. Furthermore, if there are any interruptions in TLBBs and TLBB 3Ds operations due to unexpected server interruptions, network failures or other factors, game players may be prevented or deterred from making purchases of virtual items, which could also cause significant decreases in our revenues, net income and cash flow. We face intense competition, which could reduce our market share and adversely affect our financial performance. There are many companies that distribute online content and services targeting Chinese Internet users. We compete with distributors of content and services over the Internet, including content sites, Web directories, search engines, online games, Internet service providers and sites maintained by government and educational institutions. These sites compete with us for user traffic, advertising dollars, online game players, potential partners and mobile services. The Internet market in China is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Competition is intense and expected to increase significantly in the future, because there are no substantial barriers to entry in our market. We have many competitors in the PRC Internet market, including among others Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Sina, NetEase, TouTiao.com, Phoenix, Autohome, BitAuto, Youku Tudou, iQIYI, SouFun, Leju, YY, Qihoo, UCWeb, Google, Microsoft, Kingsoft, IGG Inc. NetDragon, Kalends Inc., Ourpalm Corporate limited, Century Cruises (formerly known as Giant Interactive Group Inc.), Da Xing (formerly known as Perfect World Co., Ltd.) and Shulong Technologies (formerly known as Shanda Games Limited). We compete with our peers and competitors in China primarily on the following basis:  access to financial resources;  gateway to a host of Internet user activities;  technological advancements;  attractiveness of products;  brand recognition;  volume of traffic and users;  quality of Internet platforms and content; 43 Table of Contents  strategic relationships;  quality of services;  effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;  talented staff; and  pricing; Our competitors may have certain competitive advantages over us including:  greater brand recognition among Internet users and clients;  better products and services;  larger user and advertiser bases;  more extensive and well developed marketing and sales networks; and  substantially greater financial and technical resources. Our existing competitors may in the future achieve greater market acceptance and gain a greater market share through launching of new products, introducing new technologies, or forming alliances among themselves, or may enhance their ability to compete with us through mergers and acquisitions or financing activities. For example, during the past few years, many of our competitors have successfully raised significant amounts of capital through IPOs, follow-on public equity offerings, and convertible bond offerings. Several of our competitors have also conducted private placements of equity or debt that included alliances with larger partners who are able to bring them strategic advantages in addition to financing. By enhancing their capital bases and forming strategic alliances, our competitors have strengthened their competitiveness and gained greater brand recognition. Recently some of our major competitors have engaged in or initiated transactions that could make it more difficult for us to compete against them effectively. For example, Alibabas pending acquisition of Youku Tudou could provide Youku Tudou with considerably greater financial and other resources than were previously available to it for developing and expanding its online video business, which resources we would be unlikely to be able to match. In addition, Qihoo, with which we compete in our search and search-related business, has entered into a proposed going private transaction that would result in the delisting of its shares from the New York Stock Exchange; Baidu recently announced a proposal to sell its majority interest in its online video subsidiary iQiyi to members of Baidus and iQiyis management; and there are indications that SouFun may spin off a portion of its business. These transactions could enhance Qihoos, iQiyis and SouFuns competitive positions relative to ours by giving them greater flexibility in their business operations and an opportunity to seek high valuations on alternative share exchanges, such as PRC exchanges, which could in turn provide them with increased capital resources, the ability to offer more valuable equity incentives for purposes of personnel recruiting, and valuable equity to use as consideration for strategic acquisitions. It is also possible that new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. In addition, operators of leading Websites or Internet service providers, including Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Google and Microsoft, currently offer, and could expand, their online products and services targeting China. Such entities may cooperate with other organizations in China to accelerate their entry into, and to enhance their competitiveness in, the key Chinese markets in which we operate. As a result, we are likely to need additional financial and additional strategic resources in order to compete effectively in the primary markets in which we operate. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing products or in attracting and retaining users and advertisers, our revenues and growth rates could decline. If we fail to successfully develop and introduce new products, features and services, our ability to attract and retain users and generate revenues could be harmed. We are continually developing new products, features and services for our users. The planned timing or introduction of new products, features and services is subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual timing may differ materially from original plans. Unexpected technical, operational, distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of one or more of our new products or services. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide new products, features and services faster than we can. Moreover, we cannot be sure that any of our new products, features and services will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenue. 44 Table of Contents In addition, we may experience difficulties in promoting our new products, features and services as a result of the significant market power of our competitors or any anti-competitive practices they might engage in. For example, our efforts to increase Sogou Input Methods market share and Sogou Browsers penetration of the market through the frequent launch and promotion of new functions in our existing products have been impeded by certain of our existing competitors actions. Such actions have included using products, with the stated premise of protecting users Internet security, to present technical obstacles to Sogou Input Method and Sogou Browser, such as preventing the installation or interrupting the running of Sogou Input Method and Sogou Browser or inducing users to uninstall Sogou Browser. As a result, despite considerable efforts in this regard, we may fail to attract and retain users. As our products and services are currently accessed primarily through mobile phones, tablets and other internet-enabled mobile devices, we believe that we must develop products and applications for such devices if we are to maintain or increase our market share and revenues, and we may not be successful in doing so. Devices other than personal computers, such as mobile phones, tablets, wearable devices and other internet-enabled mobile devices, are used increasingly in China and in overseas markets, and have surpassed personal computers as the primary means to access the Internet in the key Chinese markets in which we operate. We believe that, for our business to be successful, we will need to design, develop, promote and operate new products and applications that will be popular with such devices. The design and development of new products and applications may not be successful. We may encounter difficulties with the installation of such new products and applications for mobile devices, and such products and applications may not function smoothly. As new devices are released or updated, we may encounter problems in developing and upgrading our products or applications for use on mobile devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such products or applications for mobile devices. Our business depends on a strong brand; thus we will not be able to attract users, customers and clients of our products and offerings if we do not maintain and develop our brands. It is critical for us to maintain and develop our brands so as to effectively expand our user base and our revenues. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as the number of Internet users in China grows. In order to attract and retain Internet users, brand advertising, search, online game and mobile customers, we may need to substantially increase our expenditures for creating and maintaining brand loyalty. Our success in promoting and enhancing our brands, as well as our ability to remain competitive, will also depend on our success in offering high quality content, features and functionality. If we fail to promote our brands successfully or if our users or advertisers do not perceive our content and services to be of high quality, we may not be able to continue growing our business and attracting users, advertisers, online game players and mobile users. Our failure to keep up with rapid technology changes may severely affect our future success. The Internet industry is undergoing rapid technological changes. Our future success will depend on our ability to respond to rapidly evolving technologies, adapt our services to changing industry standards and improve the performance and reliability of our services. If we fail to adapt to such changes, our business may be adversely affected. For example, with the emergence of cloud computing technology, the primary Internet technology platform has been transformed from a traditional platform to a cloud computing platform. If we fail to adapt to the transformation, our products and services upgrade process will fall behind our competitors, and accordingly weaken our capacity to adapt our technology to the market. Furthermore, cloud computing itself is a significant business opportunity. If we fail to seize the opportunity, we will lose our ability to capture a share of that market. In addition, as mobile devices other than personal computers are increasingly used to access the Internet, we must develop products and services for such devices. To meet advertisers needs in targeting potential advertisers accurately, we need to develop and operate a more effective system for our advertising delivery, tracking and recording. Otherwise, we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and market share. In the meantime, the MIIT and other PRC governmental authorities can be expected to regularly promulgate standards and other regulations regarding Internet software and other Internet-based technologies. Adapting to any such standards and regulations could require us to make significant expenditures in the future. 45 Table of Contents Our strategy of acquiring complementary assets, technologies and businesses may fail and result in impairment losses. As a component of our growth strategy, we have acquired and intend to actively identify and acquire assets, technologies and businesses that are complementary to our existing businesses. Our acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, issuance of potentially dilutive equity securities, significant impairment losses related to goodwill or amortization expenses related to intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of acquired companies. For example, in 2014 Changyou recognized a $33.8 million impairment loss for goodwill and a $15.3 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets related to RaidCall, as a result of Changyous managements assessment that the impairments existed based on its conclusion that RaidCall was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyous online games business. In 2015 Changyou recognized a $29.6 million impairment loss for good will and an $8.9 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets relating to the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap, which was acquired by Changyou in 2014, as a result of Changyous managements conclusion that expected synergies with Changyous platform channel business would not materialize. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if we are required to reassess our goodwill or other amortizable intangible assets. We are required under U.S. GAAP to test for goodwill impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review. Currently our brand advertising business is losing money, and goodwill under the brand advertising reporting unit will be impaired if the losses continue. We are also required to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization and slower or declining growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined. Any changes in accounting rules for share-based compensation may adversely affect our operating results, our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace. Our performance is largely dependent on talented and highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. We have a history of using employee share options and restricted stock units to align employees interest with the interests of our shareholders and encourage quality employees to join us and retain our quality employees by providing competitive compensation packages. On January 1, 2006, we adopted revised guidance on accounting for share-based compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based compensation based on estimated fair values. As a result, our operating results contain a charge for share-based compensation expense related to employee share options and restricted stock units. The recognition of share-based compensation in our statement of comprehensive income would have a negative effect on our reported results and earnings per share, which could in turn negatively affect our stock price. On the other hand, if we alter our employee stock incentive plan to minimize the share-based compensation expenses, it may limit our ability to continue to use share-based awards as a tool to attract and retain our employees, and it may adversely affect our operations. We cannot assure that there will be no changes in the accounting rules for share-based compensation in future; thus our operating results, our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace may be adversely affected. Our failure to manage growth and adapt to evolving industry trends and business models could harm us. We have experienced dramatic growth in personnel in the past and we expect to continue to hire additional personnel. This growth requires significant time and resource commitments from us and our senior management. If we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees or anticipate our future growth, our business could be adversely affected. As we have approximately 10,600 employees, it can be difficult for us to fully monitor each employees behavior. In addition, as we are expanding our business into many cities throughout China to provide localized products and services, it is harder for us to monitor and regulate the overall behavior of our branch offices or of individual employees at such branch offices, to effectively implement our strategy to local offices and to manage the growth of these local operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain policies and procedures that are rigorous enough or that we will be able to cause all of our employees or all of our branch offices to behave in conformity with those policies and procedures, or to ensure that our employees will not engage in conduct that could expose us to third-party liability or governmental sanctions, which may limit our future growth and hamper our business strategy. Additionally, our business relies on our financial reporting and data systems (including our systems for billing users of our fee-based services), which have grown increasingly complex in the recent past due to acquisitions and the diversification and complexity of our business. Our ability to operate our business efficiently depends on these systems, and if we are unable to adapt to these changes, our business could be adversely affected. 46 Table of Contents Moreover, to keep pace with the rapidly developing and evolving Internet industry, we must explore new products, services or revenue models for our business. For example, in addition to using traditional advertising forms, we have begun to embed product placements in our self-developed content; and for our real estate business, we sell paid memberships through which potential home buyers can purchase properties from our partner developers at discounts. Since we have limited experience in these business areas, we may fail to manage growth and adapt to industry trends and business models. In addition, the Internet industry has seen a significant shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices and accordingly we must develop new products and services that are adaptable to mobile devices so as to attract users and cause our existing users to remain with us. If we are unable to successfully adapt to new business models by developing and investing in new business strategies, products, services and technologies, our ability to maintain and expand our business in the future may be impeded. If we fail to establish and maintain relationships with content, technology or infrastructure providers, we may not be able to attract and retain users. We rely on third party providers for high-quality news, video, audio and text content in order to make our Internet platforms more attractive to users and advertisers. Most of our content providers have increased the fees they charge us for their content. This trend has increased our costs and operating expenses and has affected our ability to obtain content at an economically acceptable cost. Video content costs have escalated sharply in recent years. If we are not able to purchase as much video content as we did in 2014 and 2015, the size of our video library will be reduced and our attractiveness to users will be severely impaired and advertisers may choose not to advertise through our Internet platforms, including our Internet platforms for video. Except for exclusive content that we obtain from certain of our video content providers, much of the third party content provided to our Internet platforms is also available from other sources or may be provided to other Internet companies. If other Internet companies present the same or similar content in a superior manner, it would adversely affect our user traffic. Our business also depends significantly on relationships with leading technology and infrastructure providers and the licenses that the technology providers have granted to us. Our competitors may establish the same relationships as we have, which may adversely affect us. We may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on commercially attractive terms. We depend on key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose the services of our key executives and employees. Our future success is heavily dependent upon the services of our key executives, particularly Dr. Charles Zhang, who is the founder, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, and a major shareholder of our company. We rely on his expertise in our business operations. For Sogou, we rely heavily on the services of Xiaochuan Wang, Sogous Chief Executive Officer. For Changyou, we rely heavily on the services of Carol Yu and Dewen Chen, Changyous Co-Chief Executive Officers. If one or more of our key executives and employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily and our business may be severely disrupted. In addition, if any of our key executives or employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose know-how, key professionals and staff members as well as customers, suppliers and incur additional expenses to recruit and train personnel. Each of our executive officers has entered into an employment agreement and a confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation agreement with us. However, the degree of protection afforded to an employer pursuant to confidentiality and non-competition undertakings governed by PRC law may be more limited when compared to the degree of protection afforded under the laws of other jurisdictions. We do not maintain key-man life insurance for any of our key executives. We also rely on a number of key technology staff for our business. Given the competitive nature of the industry, and in particular our competitors increasingly aggressive efforts to provide competitive compensation packages to attract talent in the key Chinese markets where we operate, the risk of key technology staff leaving Sohu is high and could have a disruptive impact on our operations. The recent migration of some of our competitors to listings on stock exchanges in the PRC has in some cases made it more difficult for us to retain and attract talent, because such competitors are often able to offer employees and potential employees equity incentives based on the recent higher valuations of many companies listed on the PRC exchanges, which we may not be able to match. 47 Table of Contents Our growth may cause significant pressures upon our financial, operational, and administrative resources. Our financial, operational, and administrative resources may be inadequate to sustain the growth we want to achieve. As the demands of our users and the needs of our customers change, the number of our users and volume of online advertising increase, requirements for maintaining sufficient servers to provide high-definition online video and to provide game players smooth online game experiences increase, requirements for search traffic and users requirements as to the quality of search services increase, and mobile activities increase, we will need to increase our investment in our network infrastructure, facilities and other areas of operations. If we are unable to manage our growth and expansion effectively, the quality of our services could deteriorate and our business may suffer. Our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to:  access financial resources;  adapt our services and maintain and improve the quality of our services;  protect our Internet platforms from hackers and unauthorized access;  continue training, motivating and retaining our existing employees and attract and integrate new employees; and  maintain and improve our operational, financial, accounting and other internal systems and controls. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business. We regard our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may adversely affect our business and reputation. For example, a third-party Internet platforms operator might provide its users access to video content on our Internet platforms while blocking Internet advertisements embedded in our video content, which could adversely affect our online advertising revenues and our reputation with our current and potential advertising clients. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. For example, some of our self-developed Web series video productions were disseminated by third parties without our authorization. Furthermore, under the newly amended Patent Law of the PRC (promulgated by the NPC Standing Committee on December 27, 2008, and effective as of October 1, 2009), the State Councils Patent Administration Department may grant a compulsory license to individuals or entities to use one or more of our patents if our exploitation of the patents has been determined to violate the antitrust laws. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. In particular, the laws of the PRC and certain other countries are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. For example, in 2015, we filed intellectual property-related lawsuits within Mainland China, including 17 patent infringement lawsuits relating to the Sogou Input Method. We cannot be certain that judgments from the lawsuits will be issued in our favor, or that any resulting damages will cover our business losses and litigation expenses. If our campaigns and lawsuits against piracy do not achieve their intended effect, our business and operation may be adversely affected. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely to us, materially disrupt our business. We cannot be certain that the products, services and intellectual property used in our normal course of business do not or will not infringe valid patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and legal proceedings relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business and have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to pay damages or to agree to restrict our activities. In particular, if we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, may be ordered to pay damages or fines, and may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives. We may incur substantial expense in defending against third party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability or may materially disrupt the conduct of our business by restricting or prohibiting our use of the intellectual property in question. In March 2008, we were sued by four major record companies, Sony BMG, Warner, Universal and Gold Label, which alleged that we had provided music search links and download services that violated copyrights they owned. Although the lawsuits were settled in 2013 without any payment of damages by us, we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future. In addition, it is possible that content on our Sohu News App, which not only includes content developed by us but also provides a platform for a significant amount of content generated by others, may violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. Furthermore, PRC governmental authorities have recently been drawing attention to issues regarding the infringement of online intellectual property rights. For example, the Jian Wang 2015 campaign, which targets five primary types of Internet infringement and piracy, was launched on June 10, 2015. 48 Table of Contents We may be subject to, and may expend significant resources in defending against, claims based on the content and services we provide over our Internet platforms. As our services may be used to download and distribute information to others, there is a risk that claims may be made against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or based on the nature and content of such information. Furthermore, we could be subject to claims for the online activities of our users and incur significant costs in our defense. In the past, claims based on the nature and content of information that was posted online by users have been made in the United States against companies that provide online services. We do not carry any liability insurance against such risks. We could be exposed to liability for the selection of listings that may be accessible through our Internet platforms or through content and materials that our users may post in classifieds, message boards, micro blog, chat rooms or other interactive services. If any information provided through our services contains errors, third parties may make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on the information. We also offer Web-based e-mail and subscription services, which expose us to potential liabilities or claims resulting from:  unsolicited e-mail;  lost or misdirected messages;  illegal or fraudulent use of e-mail; or  interruptions or delays in e-mail service. Investigating and defending any such claims may be expensive, even if they do not result in liability. We may not have exclusive rights to trademarks, designs and technologies that are crucial to our business. We have applied for initial registrations in the PRC and overseas, and/or changes in registrations relating to transfers of our key trademarks in the PRC, including Sohu.com logos, Sohu Fox logos, www.focus.com.cn, GoodFeel logos, Go2Map, Sogou logos, Sohu Focus, TLBB, ChangYou.com, cyou.com, TL logos, DMD, 17173 and the corresponding Chinese versions of the marks, so as to establish and protect our exclusive rights to these trademarks. We have also applied for patents relating to our business. While we have succeeded in registering the trademarks for most of these marks in the PRC under certain classes, the applications for initial registration, and/or changes in registrations relating to transfers, of some marks and/or of some of marks under other classes are still under examination by the Trademark Office of the SAIC, and relevant authorities overseas. While we have succeeded in obtaining some patents, some of our patent applications are still under examination by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC. Approvals of our initial trademark registration applications, and/or of changes in registrations relating to such transfers, or of our patent applications, are subject to determinations by the Trademark Office of the SAIC, the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC and relevant authorities overseas that there are no prior rights in the applicable territory. We cannot assure that these applications will be approved. Any rejection of these applications could adversely affect our rights to the affected marks, designs and technologies. In addition, even if these applications are approved, we cannot assure you that any registered trademark or issued patent will be sufficient in scope to provide adequate protection of our rights. We may be subject to claims for invasion of personal privacy, which may force us to incur legal expenses and, if determined adversely to us, materially disrupt our business. We allow users to upload written materials, images, pictures and other content on our platform and download, share, link to audio, video and other content either on our platform or from other Websites through our platform. Procedures that we have designed to reduce the likelihood that content will be used without proper licenses or third-party consents may not be effective in preventing the unauthorized posting or sharing of content. We cannot be certain that content uploaded or shared by our users is legal and will not violate the privacy of others. In August 2014, the supreme peoples court promulgated the Provisions of the Supreme Peoples Court on Application of Laws to Cases Involving Civil Disputes over Infringement upon Personal Rights and Interests by Using Information Networks, which provide that if an ICP operator discloses genetic information, medical records, health examination data, criminal record, home address, private events and or other personal information of a natural person online, causing damage to the person, the Peoples Court should support a claim by the infringed party for recovery of damages from the infringing ICP operator. Defending invasion of privacy litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and we may not obtain favorable outcomes in such cases. Such claims, even if they do not result in liability, may harm our reputation. 49 Table of Contents We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks. Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, avian influenza, SARS or other epidemics or outbreaks. China reported a number of cases of SARS in April 2003. In recent years, there have been reports of occurrences of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza and of avian influenza in various parts of China, including a few confirmed human cases and deaths. Any prolonged recurrence of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, avian influenza, SARS or other adverse public health developments in China may have a material adverse effect on our business operations. These could include illness and loss of our management and key employees, as well as temporary closure of our offices and related business operations, such as server operations, upon which we rely. Such loss of management and key employees or closures would severely disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, avian influenza, SARS or any other epidemic. In addition, other major natural disasters may also adversely affect our business by, for example, causing disruptions of the Internet network or otherwise affecting access to our portals and our games. For example, after the Sichuan earthquake in May 2008, we suspended our delivering of online advertisements and our MMOG operations during a three-day national mourning period. We do not have business insurance coverage. The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products, or offer them at a high price. As a result, we do not have any business liability, loss of data or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of our resources. We depend on brand advertising for a significant portion of our revenues, but the brand advertisement market includes many uncertainties, which could cause our brand advertising revenues to decline. We derive a significant portion of our revenues, and expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future, from the sale of advertising space on our Internet platforms. Brand advertising revenues represented approximately 30% and 33% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, sales to our five largest advertisers accounted for approximately 10% and 8%, respectively, of our total brand advertising revenues. The growth of our brand advertising revenues relies on increased revenue from the sale of advertising spaces on our Internet platforms, which may be affected by many of the following risk factors:  The brand advertising market is rapidly evolving in China. As a result, many of our current and potential advertising clients historically have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising budget to Internet-based advertising;  Changes in government policy could restrict or curtail our brand advertising services. For example, during the last several years, the PRC government enacted a series of regulations, administrative instructions and policies to restrict online medical advertising. As a result of these regulations, we may lose some of our existing medical advertising clients;  Advertising clients may adopt new methods and strategies other than brand advertising to promote their brand and therefore our advertising revenue would be negatively affected;  The acceptance of the Internet as a medium for advertising depends on the development of standards for measuring the effectiveness of advertisements disseminated over the Internet, and no standards have been widely accepted for the measurement of the effectiveness of brand advertising over the Internet. Industry-wide standards may not develop that are sufficient to support the Internet as an effective advertising medium. If these standards do not develop, advertisers may choose not to advertise on the Internet in general or through our portals or search engines;  Historically we have charged our advertisers on a CPC basis, where we charge when users click on our advertisers promotional links displayed on our Internet platforms. However, increasing numbers of advertisers are indicating that in the future they will only enter into contracts with us pursuant to which we would charge on a Cost Per Action (CPA) basis, where users must not only click on the links but must also download and install the advertisers promotional software or applications and run the installed software or applications at least once. If this migration from a CPC to a CPA payment model continues on a large scale, or if CPA advertisements cannot generate enough user actions that can be tracked as delivered advertisements, our advertising revenues will be adversely affected; and  We may not have systems that are sufficiently well-developed to support the CPM pricing models, and as a result, we may suffer system bugs that cause bad user experiences errors or omission in publishing our clients advertisements, which could have a negative impact on our brand advertising business. 50 Table of Contents In addition, our ability to generate and maintain significant brand advertising revenues will also depend upon:  the development of a large base of users possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertising clients;  the acceptance of brand advertisement as an effective way for business marketing by advertising clients;  the effectiveness of our advertising delivery, tracking and reporting systems;  the resistance pressure on brand advertising prices and limitations on inventory; and  the establishment of a successful business model to make our new products adaptable to portable devices, which has required, and will continue to require us, to make significant expenditures for research, development, promotion and operations. Many advertisers have shifted their PC online advertising budgets to advertising on mobile devices. Hence we must successfully optimize, adapt and make attractive our various product and service offerings for access on mobile devices and must effectively deliver advertising content in a manner that attracts and retains users interest and attention or our online advertising business will suffer. Our costs for brand advertising have increased significantly as a result of our investment in online video services. If we are unable to manage the growth of our online video business successfully and control its operating costs effectively, our business may be adversely affected. In 2007 we launched our video service, and its operation requires significant upfront capital expenditures as well as continuous, substantial investment in content, technology, infrastructure and brand promotion for both PCs and mobile devices. Although we have attempted to control our costs relating to content, bandwidth, marketing, and other items for online video services, our operating expenses have increased significantly and may continue to escalate. We have to continuously invest additional financial, operational, strategic, technological, personnel and other resources in order to compete with vertical online video sites that have raised significant capital through initial public offerings and other financing activities, which may significantly strain our resources and negatively affect our operating results. We are increasingly required to pay license fees upfront for video content prior to its production. There often are delays of several months, or sometimes up to two or three years, between our payment of such up-front fees and the time when we are able to offer fully-developed content online and begin to receive advertising dollars. These delays have often placed, and can be expected to continue to place, significant strains on our cash flow. Our up-front payments also subject us to a certain level of credit risk, as content producers to which we make such payments may fall into financial difficulties and be unable to deliver the content we have purchased. We are also subjected to the risk that the quality of content will not be up to our expectations. In addition, when we purchase rights to the online versions of TV series, we generally rely on the expectation that the series will be broadcast on nationwide TV channels according to a specified schedule. If there are delays in such TV broadcasts, we will have to delay, perhaps indefinitely, our presentation of the online version of the series. We are also subject to the risk that TV content we purchase will be broadcast on less popular TV channels than expected, which will cause our online viewership to be correspondingly lower than we expected. We have spent, and will continue to spend, significant resources to develop our own TV series and other video content. We have also invested, and will likely invest in the future, in the production of movies by selected independent third-party movie studios, where we have exclusive rights to distribute the online versions of such movies on our Internet platforms for video. If our self-developed TV series or other video content, or movies in which we invest, are not well received by viewers and/or fail to attract sufficient advertising placements from advertisers, we may not be able to recoup our production costs or investments in movie production. Although Chinas online video industry has experienced substantial growth in recent years in terms of both users and content, we cannot assure you that the online video industry will continue to grow as rapidly as it has in the past, if at all. With the development of technology, new forms of media may emerge and render online video Websites less attractive to users. Growth of the online video industry is affected by numerous factors, such as users general online video experience, technological innovations, development of Internet and Internet-based services, regulatory changes in general, and regulations affecting copyright in particular, and the macroeconomic environment. If the online video industry in China does not grow as quickly as expected or if we fail to benefit from such growth by successfully implementing our business strategies, our user traffic may decrease and our business and prospects may be adversely affected. 51 Table of Contents We rely on advertising agencies to sell our brand advertising services. As advertising agencies in the Chinese market have consolidated recently, the bargaining power of the large advertising agencies resulting from such consolidation may permit them to require that we pay higher sales rebates, which would adversely affect our gross margin. Most of our brand advertising services are distributed by advertising agencies. In 2015, for example, approximately 74% of our brand advertising revenues were derived from advertising agencies. In consideration for these agencies services, we are required to pay certain percentages of revenues as sales rebates. Partially as a result of recent consolidation in the advertising agency market, during 2015 the biggest 10 advertising agencies in China contributed approximately 36% of our brand advertising revenue. If the brand advertising market is effectively controlled by a small number of large advertising agencies, such advertising agencies may be in a position to demand higher sales rebates based on increased bargaining power, which could negatively affect our brand advertising growth. As an attempt to strengthen our bargaining power in the real estate market, beginning in 2012 we converted to direct sales of our advertising services instead of relying on agencies. We are not sure whether this change will be successful, and if it is not, we could lose our sale channels where we had previously relied on agencies. The expansion of Internet advertisement blocking measures may result in a decrease of advertising revenues. The development of Web software that blocks Internet advertisements before they appear on a users screen may hinder the growth of online advertising. For example, some Rich Site Summary, or RSS, Internet platforms allow their users to access video content from our Internet platforms, while completely blocking our advertisements from being viewed by their users. Since our advertising revenues are generally based on user views, the expansion of advertisement blocking on the Internet may decrease our advertising revenues because, when an advertisement is blocked, it is not downloaded from the server, which means such advertisements will not be tracked as a delivered advertisement. In addition, advertisers may choose not to advertise on the Internet or on our Internet platforms because of the use by third parties of Internet advertisement blocking measures. In addition, increasing numbers of browsers include technical barriers designed to prevent Internet information service providers such as us to trail the browsing history of the Internet users, which is also like to adversely affect the growth of online advertising. If video content we acquire or license fails to attract and retain users and advertisers, we may not be able to generate sufficient user traffic to allow us to maintain or increase our video revenues. The success of our online video business largely depends on our ability to generate sufficient user traffic, through provision of attractive products, to in turn attract advertisers to place advertisements on our Internet platforms for video. In order to attract and retain users, we have needed, and will continue to need, to expend significant resources to develop our own or acquire from third parties high-quality video content. In 2015, we purchased significant amounts of exclusive video contents, through which we generated user traffic and revenues by bartering for other video content from other parties or distributing to other third parties. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to acquire exclusive content rights in the future and our user traffic and revenues generated from such exclusive content rights could be reduced. Moreover, if we fail to produce by ourselves or acquire from third parties high-quality video content, or if video content we develop by ourselves or acquire proves to be less attractive to users than we anticipated, our user traffic and our market share could be adversely effected, which could result in our being unable to maintain or increase our video revenues. Videos and other types of content and materials displayed on our Internet platforms may be found objectionable by PRC regulatory authorities, may subject us to penalties and other administrative actions, and may be subject us to liabilities for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or other allegations. The PRC government has adopted regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of videos over the Internet. In addition to professionally produced content, we allow our users to upload videos to our Internet platforms. Our users can upload all types of content, including user-created and professionally produced content, and can upload graphic files for limited purposes, such as updating user biographies. Although we have adopted internal procedures to monitor the content displayed on our Internet platforms, due to the significant amount of content uploaded by our users, we may not be able to identify all videos or other content that may violate relevant laws and regulations. Failure to identify and prevent illegal or inappropriate content from being displayed on our Internet platforms may subject us to liability. 52 Table of Contents To the extent that PRC regulatory authorities find any content displayed on our Internet platforms objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of such content on our Internet platforms, with take-down orders or otherwise. The SAPPRFT publishes from time to time lists of content that it considers objectionable, and we must dedicate teams of employees to continually monitor user-uploaded content and remove content that is deemed objectionable. In addition, regulatory authorities may impose penalties on us based on content displayed on or linked to our Internet platforms in cases of significant violations, including a revocation of our operating licenses or a suspension or shutdown of our online operations. In the event that PRC regulatory authorities find the video content on our Internet platforms objectionable and impose penalties on us or take other administrative actions against us in the future, our business and reputation may be adversely affected. Moreover, the costs of compliance with these regulations may continue to increase as more content is uploaded by our users. In addition, under PRC laws and regulations governing online advertising, online publishers, such as us, are required to monitor advertising content displayed on their Internet platforms for accuracy, and for compliance with PRC law governing the dissemination of content over the Internet that is deemed to be unlawful or inappropriate. If we were found to have failed to fulfill our obligation to monitor the advertisements of an advertising customer, we could be subject to various penalties, including being prohibited from providing advertising services for advertisers in the entire industry of the customer. We have been involved in litigation based on allegations of infringement of third-party copyright and other rights, such as privacy and image rights, due to the videos displayed on our Internet platforms. See Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us, materially disrupt our business. While we have implemented internal procedures to review videos uploaded by our users and remove promptly from our Internet platforms any infringing videos after we receive infringement notifications from rights owners, due to the significant number of videos uploaded by users, we may not be able to identify all content that may infringe on third-party rights. Moreover, some rights owners may not send us a notice before bringing a lawsuit against us. Thus, our failure to identify unauthorized videos posted on our Internet platforms has subjected us to, and may in the future subject us to, claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or other rights. In addition, we may be subject to administrative actions brought by the NCA or its local branches for alleged copyright infringement. We may also face litigation or administrative actions for defamation, negligence, or other purported injuries resulting from videos and advertisements that we display on our Internet platforms. Such litigation and administrative actions, with or without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming and may result in significant diversion of resources and management attention from our business operations. Furthermore, such litigation or administrative actions may adversely affect our brand image and reputation. Our revenues from mobile-related services have decreased recently and are expected to grow only minimally, or to decrease, in the future. Our mobile-related services revenues, which are classified as others revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are derived from mobile-related services and mobile products offered in cooperation with China mobile network operators to mobile phone users and to China mobile network operators, have decreased recently, and represent only a small portion of our total revenues. We expect mobile revenues to grow only minimally, or to decrease, in the future. Our search and search-related revenues may not sustain their growth or may decrease in the future. The growth of our search and search-related revenue is subject to the following risks: As increasing numbers of users are using mobile devices to access the Internet, if we are unable to attract and retain mobile users to our products and services, we may fail to capture market share for mobile search;  We may not be able to achieve greater market acceptance or gain additional market share from our existing competitors or new competitors;  Many of our current and potential advertisers have limited experience with the Internet as a marketing channel, and historically have not devoted a significant portion of their marketing budgets to online marketing and promotion. As a result, they may not consider the Internet to be an effective channel to promote their products and services as compared to traditional print and broadcast media;  Although devices other than personal computers, such as mobile phones, tablets and other internet-enabled mobile devices, are increasingly used to access the Internet, many of our current and potential advertisers have limited experience using the Internet as a marketing channel with advertising content delivered by Mobile Apps to such mobile devices, and may not be ready to devote a significant portion of their Internet marketing budgets to mobile Internet marketing and promotion; 53 Table of Contents  Our success depends on providing products and services to attract users and enable users to have a high-quality Internet experience. A loss of users could weaken our brand and result in a loss of advertisers, which would have a material adverse effect on revenues;  We may be unable to retain our existing advertisers or attract new advertisers;  We rely heavily on our nationwide agency network of third-party agencies for our sales to, and collection of payment from, our advertisers. We cannot assure that we will continue to maintain favorable relationships with those agencies; and  We rely on our Website Alliance members for a significant portion of our search revenues. If we fail to retain existing Website Alliance members or attract additional members, our revenues and growth may be adversely affected. If Sogous collaboration with Tencent is terminated or curtailed, Sogous business would likely to be adversely affected. A substantial amount of our search and search-related traffic is generated from users of Tencent products and services, and Sogou relies on Tencent for the promotion of some Sogou products and services. In addition, Sogou collaborates with Tencent to provide differentiated products and services. For example, Sogou launched a unique Weixin search function for both PCs and mobile devices that allows users to search the large amount of content that is published on Weixin accounts. If Sogous collaborative relationship with Tencent is terminated or curtailed, or if Tencent does not continue to deliver an adequate level of access to its platforms or adequately promote Sogou products and services, Sogou business would likely be adversely affected. If we fail to retain key agencies or attract additional agencies for sales to our search advertisers, our search business may be adversely affected. We rely heavily on our nationwide distribution network of third-party agencies for our sales to, and collection of payment from, our search (including pay-for-click services) advertisers. If our agencies do not provide quality services to our advertisers or otherwise breach their contracts with them, we may lose our advertisers. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our agencies, including our key agencies, and cannot assure that we will continue to maintain favorable relationships with them. We rely on our Website Alliance members for a significant portion of our search revenues. If we fail to retain existing Website Alliance members or attract additional members, our revenues and growth may be adversely affected. We enhance the distribution of advertisers promotional links or advertisements by leveraging traffic on Sogous Website Alliance members Websites, and revenues generated from the Website Alliance account for a significant portion of our total pay-for-click revenues. If the Website Alliance members decide to use a competitors or their own Internet search services, or if we fail to attract additional Websites to join Sogous Website Alliance, our pay-for-click revenues will be adversely affected. If we fail to detect significant fraudulent click-through, we could lose the confidence of our search advertisers and our search revenues could decline. Our search business is exposed to the risk of click-through fraud on our paid search results. Click-through fraud occurs when a person clicks paid search results for a reason other than to view the underlying content of search results. If we fail to detect significant fraudulent clicks or otherwise are unable to prevent significant fraudulent activity, the affected search advertisers may experience a reduced return on their investment in our pay-for-click services and lose confidence in the integrity of our pay-for-click service systems, and we may have to issue refunds to our advertisers. If this happens, we may be unable to retain existing advertisers and attract new advertisers for our pay-for-click services, and our search revenues could decline. In addition, affected advertisers may also file legal actions against us claiming that we have over-charged or failed to refund them. Any such claims or similar claims, regardless of their merits, could be time-consuming and costly for us to defend against and could also adversely affect our search brand and our search advertisers confidence in the integrity of our pay-for-click service systems. Risks Related to Chinas Telecommunications Infrastructure The telecommunications infrastructure in China, which is not as well developed as in the United States, may limit our growth. The telecommunications infrastructure in China is not as well developed as it is in the United States. Our growth will depend on the PRC government and state-owned enterprises establishing and maintaining a reliable Internet and telecommunications infrastructure to reach a broader base of Internet users in China. The Internet infrastructure, standards, protocols and complementary products, services and facilities necessary to support the demands associated with continued growth may not be developed on a timely basis or at all by the PRC government and state-owned enterprises. 54 Table of Contents We depend on China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom for telecommunications services, and any interruption in these services may result in severe disruptions to our business. Although private Internet service providers exist in China, almost all access to the Internet is maintained through China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the MIIT. We rely on this infrastructure and China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom to provide data communications capacity primarily through local telecommunications lines. Although the government has announced aggressive plans to develop the national information infrastructure, this infrastructure may not be developed and the Internet infrastructure in China may not be able to support the continued growth of Internet usage. In addition, we will have no access to alternative networks and services, on a timely basis if at all, in the event of any infrastructure disruption or failure. We have signed Bandwidth Provision and Server Hosting Agreements with China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. Under these agreements, we established 21 core data centers to support most of our core services. However, as there are limited telecommunication infrastructure service providers, we may not be able to lease additional bandwidth on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. If we are not able to lease additional bandwidth, the development of our business can be affected. To the extent we are unable to scale our systems to meet the increasing PRC Internet population, we will be unable to expand our user base and increase our attractiveness to advertisers and merchants. As Internet volume and traffic increase in China, we may not be able to scale our systems proportionately. To the extent we do not successfully address our capacity constraints, our operations may be severely disrupted, and we may not be able to expand our user base and increase our attractiveness to advertisers and merchants. Even if we scale our systems proportionately, any unforeseen increase in traffic may disrupt our operations and make it difficult for our users to visit our Internet platforms, or even cause users to be unable to access our Internet platforms at all, which could result in a loss of users. Unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures may result in reduced user traffic, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation. Our Internet platforms operations are dependent upon Web browsers, Internet service providers, content providers and other Internet platforms operators in China, which have experienced significant system failures and system outages in the past. Our users have in the past experienced difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. Any system failure or inadequacy that causes interruptions in the availability of our services, or increases the response time of our services, as a result of increased traffic or otherwise, could reduce our user satisfaction, future traffic and our attractiveness to users and advertisers. For example, on February 14, 2009, our blog services were disconnected because of a power loss affecting China Unicom. Although such disconnection did not have any material adverse effect on our business, we cannot assure that our business would not be affected negatively by any future similar events. Our operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events, as we only have limited backup systems and do not maintain any backup servers outside of China. We have limited backup systems and have experienced system failures and electrical outages from time to time in the past, which have disrupted our operations. Most of our servers and routers are currently hosted in a single location within the premises of BTA. Our disaster recovery plan cannot fully ensure safety in the event of damage from fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. If any of the foregoing occurs, we may experience a complete system shutdown. We do not carry any business interruption insurance. To improve the performance and to prevent disruption of our services, we may have to make substantial investments to deploy additional servers or one or more copies of our Internet platforms to mirror our online resources. Although we carry property insurance with low coverage limits, our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses, particularly with respect to loss of business and reputation that may occur. Our network operations may be vulnerable to hacking, viruses and other disruptions, which may make our products and services less attractive and reliable, and third-party online payment platforms that we partner with may be susceptible to security breaches, which may damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. Internet use can decline if any well-publicized compromise of security occurs. Hacking involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment. Hackers, if successful, could misappropriate proprietary information or cause disruptions in our service. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect our Internet platforms against hackers, and measures we may take may not be effective. In addition, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, as well as damage our reputation and decrease our user traffic. 55 Table of Contents Furthermore, we could be liable for security breaches of our users confidential information, such as credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses, stored by the third-party online payment platforms that we partner with. Since our revenues are derived in part from such payment platforms, any security breach resulting from Internet payment transactions could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our online services. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure Our interests in our two primary controlled subsidiaries could be significant diluted. Our percentage and economic interests in our two primary controlled subsidiaries, Sogou and Changyou, could be diluted by the implementation and operation of existing or future equity incentive plans or any equity issued by them as consideration for acquisitions. The occurrence of any of these dilutive events would cause our share of the revenues and earnings of the affected subsidiaries to be reduced. In order to comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we operate our main businesses through companies with which we have contractual relationships but in which we do not have an actual ownership interest. If our current ownership structure is found to be in violation of current or future PRC laws, rules or regulations regarding the legality of foreign investment in the PRC Internet sector, we could be subject to severe penalties. Various regulations in the PRC restrict or prohibit WFOEs from operating in specified industries such as Internet information, online game, mobile, Internet access, and certain other industries. We are a Delaware corporation, and Sohu Hong Kong, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the parent company of Sohu New Momentum, Sohu Era and Sohu Media; Sogou HK, our indirect controlled subsidiary and the parent company of Sogou Technology; Vast Creation, our indirect controlled subsidiary and the parent company of Sogou Network; Video HK, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the parent company of Video Tianjin; and Changyou HK, our indirect subsidiary and the parent company of AmazGame, Gamespace, Beijing Baina Technology, are foreign persons under PRC law. In order to comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we conduct our Internet and value-added telecommunication operations in the PRC through our VIEs that are incorporated in the PRC and owned by certain of our employees. Through a series of contractual arrangements, our VIEs, for which Sohu is their primary beneficiary, are effectively controlled by our indirect wholly-owned and majority-owned PRC Subsidiaries. The MIIT issued a circular in 2006 that emphasizes restrictions on foreign investment in value-added telecommunications businesses. In addition, a notice issued in 2009 by the SAPPRFT, the National Copyright Administration, and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications states that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game operating businesses in China or to exercise control over or participate in the operation of such businesses through indirect means. While we are not aware of any internet company which uses the same or similar contractual arrangements as we do having been penalized or ordered to terminate operations by PRC authorities claiming that the arrangements constituted foreign investment in value-added telecommunication services or a kind of control over or participation in the operation of online game operating businesses through indirect means, it is unclear whether and how the various regulations of the PRC authorities might be interpreted or implemented in the future. For a detailed discussion of PRC regulations, notices and circulars with respect to such restrictions, see Specific RegulationsRegulation of Foreign Direct Investment in Value-Added Telecommunications Companies and Specific RegulationsRegulation of the Online Game ServicesOnline Games and Cultural Products. Further, on January 19, 2015, MOFCOM, released on its Website for public comment a proposed PRC law, the Draft FIE Law, that appears to include VIEs within the scope of entities that could be considered to be foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, that would be subject to restrictions under existing PRC law on foreign investment in certain categories of industry. Specifically, the Draft FIE Law introduces the concept of actual control for determining whether an entity is considered to be an FIE. In addition to control through direct or indirect ownership or equity, the Draft FIE Law includes control through contractual arrangements within the definition of actual control. If the Draft FIE Law is passed by the Peoples Congress of the PRC and goes into effect in its current form, these provisions regarding control through contractual arrangements could be construed to reach our VIE arrangements, and as a result our VIEs could become explicitly subject to the current restrictions on foreign investment in certain categories of industry. The Draft FIE Law includes provisions that would exempt from the definition of foreign invested enterprises entities where the ultimate controlling shareholders are either entities organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. The Draft FIE Law is silent as to what type of enforcement action might be taken against existing VIEs, such as ours, that operate in restricted or prohibited industries and are not controlled by entities organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. If the restrictions and prohibitions on foreign invested enterprises included in the Draft FIE Law are enacted and enforced in their current form, our ability to use our VIE arrangements and our ability to conduct business through them could be severely limited. 56 Table of Contents In addition, pursuant to Circular 6 and the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire de facto control of domestic enterprises with national security concerns and prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. These national security review-related regulations are relatively new and there is a lack of clear statutory interpretation regarding the implementation of the rules, and PRC authorities may interpret these regulations to mean that the transactions implementing our VIE structures should have been submitted for review. For a discussion of these PRC national security review requirements, see Specific RegulationsMiscellaneousRegulation of M&A and Overseas Listings If we were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC law or regulations relating to foreign ownership of value-added telecommunications businesses, including the Draft FIE Law if it becomes effective, and security reviews of foreign investments in such businesses, including online games businesses, regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the operation of our business would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income, revoking the business or operating licenses of PRC subsidiaries and/or VIEs, requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, requiring us to discontinue or divest ourselves of all or any portion of our operations or assets, restricting our right to collect revenues, blocking our Internet platforms, or imposing additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if changes were required to be made to our ownership structure, our ability to consolidate our VIEs could be adversely affected. We may be unable to collect long-term loans to officers and employees or exercise management influence associated with High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace. As of December 31, 2015, Sohu had outstanding long-term loans of $9.3 million to Dr. Charles Zhang and certain other employees. These long-term loans were used to finance investments in our VIEs High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace, which are used to facilitate our participation in telecommunications, Internet content, online games and certain other businesses in China where foreign ownership is either prohibited or restricted. The loan agreements contain provisions that, subject to PRC laws, (i) the loans can only be repaid to us by transferring the shares of High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace to us; (ii) the shares of High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace cannot be transferred by the borrowers without our approval; and (iii) we have the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace. Under the loan agreements the borrowers have pledged all of their shares in High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace collateral for the loans, and the loans bear no interest and are due on the earlier of a demand or such time as Dr. Charles Zhang or one of the other employee borrowers, as the case may be, is not an employee of Sohu. Sohu does not intend to request repayment of the loans as long as PRC regulations prohibit it from directly investing in businesses engaged in by the VIEs. Because these loans can only be repaid by the borrowers transferring the shares of the various entities, our ability to ultimately realize the effective return of the amounts advanced under these loans will depend on the profitability of High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace and is therefore uncertain. Furthermore, because of uncertainties associated with PRC law, ultimate enforcement of the loan agreements is uncertain. Accordingly, we may never be able to collect these loans and we may not be able to continue to exercise influence over High Century, Heng Da Yi Tong, Tianjin Jinhu, Sogou Information, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace. 57 Table of Contents We depend upon contractual arrangements with our VIEs for the success of our business and these arrangements may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership of these businesses and may be difficult to enforce. Because we conduct our Internet operations mainly in the PRC, and are restricted or prohibited by the PRC government from owning Internet content, telecommunication, online games operations and certain other operations in the PRC, we are dependent on our VIEs in which we have no direct ownership interest, to provide those services through contractual agreements among the parties and to hold some of our assets, including some of the domain names and trademarks relating to our business. These arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over our Internet content, telecommunications operations, online games operations and certain other as direct ownership of these businesses. For example, if we had direct ownership of our VIEs, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in their boards of directors, which in turn could effect changes at the management level. Due to our VIE structure, we have to rely on contractual rights to effect control and management of our VIEs, which exposes us to the risk of potential breach of contract by the VIEs or their shareholders, such as their failing to use the domain names and trademarks held by them, or failing to maintain our Internet platforms, in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. In addition, as each of our VIEs is jointly owned by its shareholders, it may be difficult for us to change our corporate structure if such shareholders refuse to cooperate with us. In addition, some of our subsidiaries and VIEs could fail to take actions required for our business, such as entering into content development contracts with potential content suppliers or failing to maintain the necessary permits for the content servers. Furthermore, if the shareholders of any of our VIEs were involved in proceedings that had an adverse impact on their shareholder interests in such VIE or on our ability to enforce relevant contracts related to the VIE structure, our business would be adversely affected. The shareholders of the VIEs may breach, or cause the VIEs to breach, the VIE contracts for a number of reasons. For example, their interests as shareholders of the VIEs and the interests of our subsidiaries may conflict and we may fail to resolve such conflicts; the shareholders may believe that breaching the contracts will lead to greater economic benefit for them; or the shareholders may otherwise act in bad faith. If any of the foregoing were to happen, we might have to rely on legal or arbitral proceedings to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, disputes may arise among the shareholders of any of our VIEs with respect to their ownership of such VIE, which could lead them to breach their agreements with us. Such arbitral and legal proceedings and disputes may cost us substantial financial and other resources, and result in disruption of our business, and the outcome might not be in our favor. For example, a PRC court or arbitration panel could conclude that our VIE contracts violate PRC law or are otherwise unenforceable. If the contractual arrangements with any of our VIEs were found by PRC authorities with appropriate jurisdiction to be unenforceable, we could lose control over the assets owned by such VIE and lose our ability to consolidate such VIEs results of operations, assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and/or to transfer the revenues of such VIE to our corresponding PRC subsidiary. A failure by our VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. As all of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through either arbitration or litigation in the PRC, they would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. We would have to rely for enforcement on legal remedies under PRC law, including specific performance, injunctive relief or damages, which might not be effective. For example, if we sought to enforce the equity interest purchase right agreements for the transfer of equity interests in any of our VIEs, if the transferee was a foreign company the transfer would be subject to approval by PRC governmental authorities such as the MIIT and the MOFCOM, and the transferee would be required to comply with various requirements, including qualification and maximum foreign shareholding percentage requirements. As these PRC governmental authorities have wide discretion in granting such approvals, we could fail to obtain such approval. In addition, our VIE contracts might not be enforceable in China if PRC governmental authorities, courts or arbitral tribunals took the view that such contracts contravened PRC law or were otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. Furthermore, the legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could further limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event we were unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we would not be able to exert effective control over our VIEs, and our ability to conduct our business, and our financial condition and results of operations, would be severely adversely affected. The contractual arrangements between our subsidiaries and our VIEs may result in adverse tax consequences. PRC laws and regulations emphasize the requirement of an arms length basis for transfer pricing arrangements between related parties. The laws and regulations also require enterprises with related party transactions to prepare transfer pricing documentation to demonstrate the basis for determining pricing, the computation methodology and detailed explanations. Related party arrangements and transactions may be subject to challenge or tax inspection by PRC tax authorities. 58 Table of Contents Under a tax inspection, if our transfer pricing arrangements between the China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs are judged as tax avoidance, or related documentation does not meet the requirements, our China-based subsidiaries and VIEs may be subject to material adverse tax consequences, such as transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of adjustments recorded by VIEs, which could adversely affect us by (i) increasing VIEs tax liabilities without reducing our subsidiaries tax liabilities, which could further result in interest and penalties being levied on us for unpaid taxes; or (ii) limiting the ability of our PRC companies to maintain preferential tax treatment and other financial incentives. In addition, if for any reason we needed to cause the transfer of any of the shareholders equity interest in any of our VIEs to a different nominee shareholder (such as if, for example, one of such shareholders was no longer employed by us), we might be required to pay individual income tax, on behalf of the transferring shareholder, on any gain deemed to have been realized by such shareholder on such transfer. We may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by any of our VIEs that are important to the operation of our business if such VIE declares bankruptcy or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding. Each of our VIEs holds assets, such as our core intellectual property, licenses and permits, that are critical to our business operations. Although the equity interest purchase right agreements among our WFOEs, our VIEs and the shareholders of our VIEs contain terms that specifically obligate the shareholders of our VIEs to ensure the valid existence of our VIEs, in the event the shareholders breached these obligations and voluntarily liquidated our VIEs, or if any of our VIEs declared bankruptcy and all or part of its assets became subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we might be unable to continue some or all of our business operations. Furthermore, if any of our VIEs were to undergo a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its shareholders or unrelated third-party creditors might claim rights to some or all of such VIEs assets and their rights could be senior to our rights under the VIE contracts, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business. Frequent press reports in the United States questioning the VIE structure used by us and other Chinese companies publicly-traded in the United States appear to have created concern among investors, and may cause such an effect in the future. In recent years various prominent Western news outlets have questioned the use by Chinese companies that are publicly-trade in the United States of VIE structures as a means of complying with Chinese laws prohibiting or restricting foreign ownership of certain businesses in China, including businesses we are engaged in such as Internet information and content, online advertising, online game, sponsored search, and value-added telecommunication services. Some of such news reports have also sought to draw a connection between recent widely reported accounting issues at certain Chinese companies and the use of VIE structures. Such news reports appear to have had the effect of causing concern among investors in several Chinese companies, including us, that are publicly-traded in the United States. While we are not aware of any causal connection between the recently reported accounting scandals and the use of VIE structures, it is possible that investors in our common stock will believe that such a connection exists. Any of such circumstances could lead to further loss of investor confidence in Chinese companies such as ours and cause fluctuations in the market prices of our common stock and, if such prices were to drop sharply, could subject us to shareholder litigation, which could cause the price for our shares to drop further. Risks Related to Chinas Regulation Environment Political, economic and social policies of the PRC government could affect our business. Substantially all of our business, operating assets, fixed assets and operations are located in China, and substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our business may be adversely affected by changes in political, economic or social conditions in China, adjustments in PRC government policies or changes in laws and regulations. The economy of China differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in a number of respects, including:  structure;  level of government involvement;  level of development;  level of capital reinvestment;  growth rate;  control of foreign exchange; and  methods of allocating resources. 59 Table of Contents Since 1949, China has been primarily a planned economy subject to a system of macroeconomic management. Although the PRC government still owns a significant portion of the productive assets in China, economic reform policies since the late 1970s have emphasized decentralization, autonomous enterprises and the utilization of market mechanisms. We cannot predict the future effects of the economic reform and macroeconomic measures adopted by the PRC government on our business or results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government began to focus more attention on social issues in recent years and has promulgated or may promulgate additional laws or regulations in this area, which could affect our business in China. The PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to us and you, or could lead to penalties on us. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. Our PRC operating subsidiaries Sohu New Momentum, Sohu Era, Sohu Media, Video Tianjin, Sogou Technology, Sogou Network, AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology are WFOEs, which are enterprises incorporated in China and wholly-owned by our indirect off-shore subsidiaries. Those WFOEs are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. In addition, all of our subsidiaries and VIEs are incorporated in China and subject to all applicable Chinese laws and regulations. Because of the relatively short period for enacting such a comprehensive legal system, it is possible that the laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and other foreign investors, including you. Such uncertainties may also make it easier for others to infringe our intellectual property without significant cost, and new entrants to the market may tend to use gray areas to compete with us. In addition, uncertainties in the PRC legal system may lead to penalties imposed on us because of a difference in interpretation of the applicable law between the relevant governmental authority and us. For example, under current tax laws and regulations, we are responsible for paying business tax on a Self-examination and Self-application basis. However, since there is no clear guidance as to the applicability of certain areas of preferential tax treatment, we may be found to be in violation of the tax laws and regulations based on the interpretation of local tax authorities with regard to the scope of taxable services and the applicable tax rates, and therefore might be subject to penalties, including monetary penalties. In addition, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the PRC legal system, particularly with regard to the Internet, including the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. The enforcement of the PRC Labor Contract Law and other labor-related regulations in the PRC may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of the PRC enacted the Labor Contract Law in 2008, and amended it on December 28, 2012. The Labor Contract Law introduced specific provisions related to fixed-term employment contracts, part-time employment, probationary periods, consultation with labor unions and employee assemblies, employment without a written contract, dismissal of employees, severance, and collective bargaining to enhance previous PRC labor laws. Under the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obligated to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. Further, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract, with certain exceptions, must have an unlimited term, subject to certain exceptions. With certain exceptions, an employer must pay severance to an employee where a labor contract is terminated or expires. In addition, the PRC governmental authorities have continued to introduce various new labor-related regulations since the effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law. For example, there are regulations which require that annual leave ranging from five to 15 days be made available to employees and that employees be compensated for any unused annual leave days at a rate of three times their daily salary, subject to certain exceptions. Under the PRC Social Insurance Law and the Administrative Measures on Housing Fund, employees are required to participate in pension insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance and housing funds and employers are required, together with their employees or separately, to pay the social insurance premiums and housing funds for their employees. These laws designed to enhance labor protection tend to increase our labor costs. In addition, as the interpretation and implementation of these regulations are still evolving, our employment practices may not be at all times be deemed in compliance with the regulations. As a result, we could be subject to penalties or incur significant liabilities in connection with labor disputes or investigations. 60 Table of Contents If we are found to be in violation of current or future PRC laws, rules or regulations regarding Internet-related services and telecom-related activities, we could be subject to severe penalties. The PRC has enacted regulations that apply to Internet-related services and telecom-related activities. While many aspects of these regulations remain unclear, they purport to limit and require licensing of various aspects of the provision of Internet information and content, online advertising, online game, and mobile services. Under the Measures for the Administration of the Transmission of Audiovisual Programs over Internet and other Information Networks issued by the SAPPRFT (SAPPRFT Measures), which came into effect on October 11, 2004, Websites authorized to disseminate news must apply to the SAPPRFT to obtain a Permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs in order to disseminate streaming video online. In addition, SAPPRFT issued the Catalogue of Classification of Internet Audio-Video Program Services (Trial) on April 1, 2010, pursuant to which the business of providing public program searching and watching services through the Internet to the public is classified as an Internet audio-video program service for which a Permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs is required. On May 31, 2008, Sohu Internet received a Permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs, issued by the SAPPRFT, and received a renewal on June 20, 2014. However, Sogou Information has not yet been granted such a license. If Sogous provision of video search services is later challenged by the SAPPRFT, we may be subject to severe penalties, including fines, or the suspension of our video search services or even our operations. In addition, Sohus online video businesses are operated under various Internet platforms, such as sohu.com, Focus.cn and sogou.com, but current PRC laws and regulations are lack of clear provisions indicating whether it is permissible to provide video services over several Internet platforms that are owned by a single company under one permit and the SAPPRFT might claim that such operation under one permit is not allowed under the SAPPRFT Measures. If the SAPPRFT were to make such a claim, we could face penalties from the SAPPRFT, such as fines, cancellation of our existing permit, or the forced discontinuation or restriction on our video services or even our operations. If we are ordered to suspend our services, our user traffic will be reduced and therefore our revenues will be negatively affected. We cannot assure you that we have fully complied with or will in the future always comply with PRC rules and regulations regarding Internet-related services and telecom-related activities. In addition, the PRC government may promulgate new laws, rules or regulations at any time. If current or future laws, rules or regulations regarding Internet-related activities are interpreted to be inconsistent with our ownership structure and/or our business operations, our business could be severely impaired and we could be subject to severe penalties. PRC laws and regulations mandate complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to make acquisitions in China. PRC laws and regulations, such as the M&A Rules, which were jointly issued by six PRC regulatory agencies on August 8, 2006 and were amended on June 22, 2009, the Anti-Monopoly Law, Circular 6 and the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, or that the approval from the MOFCOM be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies. PRC laws and regulations also require certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to a merger control security review. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, effective from September 1, 2011, further provide that, when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to a security review by the MOFCOM, the principle of substance over form should be applied and foreign investors are prohibited from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements of offshore transaction. Factors that the MOFCOM considers in its review are whether (i) an important industry is involved, (ii) such transaction involves factors that have had or may have an impact on national economic security and (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise that holds a well-known PRC trademark or a time-honored PRC brand. If a business of any target company that we plan to acquire falls into the ambit of security review, we may not be able to successfully acquire such company. Complying with the requirements of the relevant regulation to complete any such transaction could be time-consuming, and any required approval process, including approval from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business. 61 Table of Contents In addition, under the PRC AML, which took effect in 2008, an antitrust notification must be filed with the MOFCOM prior to the closing of a business combination that reaches certain notification thresholds. Although we believe that the Sogou-Tencent Transactions were not subject to the AML and we were not required to file an antitrust notification with respect to them, it is possible that MOFCOM will consider the Sogou-Tencent Transactions to have constituted a joint venture that would require an antitrust notification under the AML. If the MOFCOM were to conclude that such a notification was required, and prevail in such conclusion, MOFCOM might instruct us to discontinue the Sogou-Tencent Transactions, and within a specified time limit, dispose of the shares or assets, transfer the business and adopt other necessary measures to return to the state prior to Sogou-Tencent Transactions, and impose a fine of up to RMB500,000 on us, which could disrupt Sogous operations and business. Even if we are in compliance with PRC governmental regulations relating to licensing and foreign investment prohibitions, the PRC government may prevent us from distributing, and we may be subject to liability for, content that it believes is inappropriate. The PRC has enacted regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news and other information. In the past, the PRC government has stopped the distribution of information over the Internet that it believes to violate PRC law, including content that is obscene, incites violence, endangers national security, is contrary to the national interest or is defamatory. In addition, we may not publish certain news items, such as news relating to national security, without permission from the PRC government. Furthermore, the Ministry of Public Security has the authority to make any local Internet service provider block any Website maintained outside the PRC at its sole discretion. Even if we comply with PRC governmental regulations relating to licensing and foreign investment prohibitions, if the PRC government were to take any action to limit or prohibit the distribution of information through our network or to limit or regulate any current or future content or services available to users on our network, our business would be harmed. We are also subject to potential liabilities for content on our Internet platforms that is deemed inappropriate and for any unlawful actions of our subscribers and other users of our systems under regulations promulgated by the MIIT, such potential liabilities including the imposition of fines or even the shutting down of the Internet platforms. Furthermore, we are required to delete content that clearly violates the laws of the PRC and report content that we suspect may violate PRC law. We may have difficulty determining the type of content that may result in liability for us and, if we are wrong, we may be prevented from operating our Internet platforms. Dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC are subject to PRC profit appropriation and PRC withholding tax. PRC legal restrictions permit payment of dividends by Sohu New Momentum, Sohu Era, Sohu Media, Video Tianjin, Sogou Technology, Sogou Network, AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology only out of their net income, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, Sohu New Momentum, Sohu Era, Sohu Media, Video Tianjin, Sogou Technology, AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology are also required to set aside 10% of their net income each year to fund certain reserve funds until these reserves equal 50% of the amount of registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Furthermore, the PRC Corporate Income Tax Law (the CIT Law) provides that a withholding tax at a rate of up to 20% may be applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors that are non-resident enterprises, to the extent that such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. All of our foreign-invested enterprises have been subjected to withholding tax since January 1, 2008, generally at a 10% rate. Under the Arrangement Between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital (China-HK Tax Arrangement), which became effective on January 1, 2007, the dividend withholding tax rate may be reduced to 5%, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividends may remain subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%. On October 27, 2009, the SAT issued a Notice on How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners in Tax Agreement (Circular 601), which provides guidance on determining whether an enterprise is a beneficial owner under Chinas tax treaties and tax arrangements. Circular 601 provides that, in order to be a beneficial owner, an entity generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. A company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and will not qualify for treaty benefits such as preferential dividend withholding tax rates. If any of our Hong Kong subsidiaries is, in the light of Circular 601, considered to be a non-beneficial owner for purpose of the China-HK Tax Arrangement, any dividends paid to it by any of our PRC Subsidiaries would not qualify for the preferential dividend withholding tax rate of 5%, but rather would be subject to the usual rate of 10%. Furthermore, to the extent that the VIEs have undistributed after-tax profits, we must pay tax on behalf of our employees who hold interests in the VIEs when the VIEs distribute dividends in the future. The current individual income tax rate is 20%. 62 Table of Contents The non-U.S. activities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and VIEs may be subject to U.S. taxation. Sohu.com Inc. is a Delaware corporation and is subject to income taxes in the United States. The majority of our subsidiaries and VIEs are based in China and are subject to income taxes in the PRC. These China-based subsidiaries and VIEs conduct substantially all of our operations, and generate most of our income in China. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), we do not provide for U.S. federal income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings or losses of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or consolidated VIEs because, for the foreseeable future, we do not have the intention to repatriate those undistributed earnings or losses to the U.S. However, our practice of not repatriating undistributed earnings to Sohu.com Inc. limits that amount of cash that would otherwise be available to us to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock from the market. In addition, certain activities conducted in the PRC may give rise to U.S. corporate income tax, even if there are no distributions to Sohu.com Inc. These taxes would be imposed on Sohu.com Inc. when its subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) generate income that is subject to Subpart F of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or Subpart F. Passive income, such as rents, royalties, interest, dividends, and gain from disposal of our investments is among the types of income subject to taxation under Subpart F. Any income taxable under Subpart F is taxable in the U.S. at federal corporate income tax rates of up to 35%. Subpart F income that is taxable to Sohu.com Inc., even if it is not distributed to Sohu.com, may also include income from intercompany transactions between Sohu.com Inc.s non-U.S. subsidiaries and Changyous non-U.S. subsidiaries, or where Sohu.com Inc.s non-U.S. subsidiaries make an investment in U.S. property, within the meaning of Subpart F, such as holding the stock in, or making a loan to, a U.S. corporation. In prior years, Sohu.com Inc. has not been required to treat dividends received by its Cayman Islands subsidiary, Sohu.com Limited, from Changyou as Subpart F income, which would be includible in Sohu.com Inc.s taxable income in the U.S., by relying on what is commonly referred to as the CFC look-through rule. Under this rule, distributions from a lower-tier CFC to a higher-tier CFC are generally not Subpart F income if the activities that gave rise to the distribution arose from an active business. The CFC look-through rule is a temporary provision of the U.S. tax code that has been extended several times by the U.S. Congress. The provision is currently scheduled to expire for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019. Unless further extended, the CFC look-through rule will be available for Sohu.com Inc.s and Changyou.com Limiteds non-U.S. subsidiaries only through their taxable years ending November 30, 2020. Sohu.com Inc. would also be subject to U.S. corporate income tax under Subpart F to the extent that Sohu.com Inc,s non-U.S. subsidiary sells Changyou ADSs at a price higher than the adjusted tax basis of such ADSs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any such resulting U.S. corporate income tax imposed on Sohu.com Inc. would reduce our consolidated net income. Our offshore entities may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by the China-based subsidiaries of Sohu.com Limited, Sogou and Changyou, our wholly-owned, controlled and majority-owned subsidiaries, to fund any cash requirements those offshore entities may have. Our offshore entities may not be able to obtain cash from distributions because our subsidiaries and VIEs in China are subject to restrictions imposed by PRC law, and may be subject to future debt covenant restrictions, on paying such dividends or making other payments. Sohu.com Inc. is a holding company with no operating assets other than investments in Chinese operating entities through our intermediate holding companies, our wholly-owned, controlled and majority-owned subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, and our VIEs. Our offshore entities may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by China-based subsidiaries of Sohu.com Limited, Sogou and Changyou for the cash requirements in excess of any cash raised from investors and retained by Sohu.com Inc. or our other offshore entities. The primary source of any dividend payments to our offshore entities would need to be our subsidiaries in China after they receive payments from our VIEs under various service agreements and other arrangements. It is possible that our China-based subsidiaries will not continue to receive payments in accordance with our contracts with our VIEs that such payments will become subject to restrictions imposed PRC law. If our subsidiaries and VIEs incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us through the intermediate companies. In addition, amounts available for dividends are further reduced because transfers of funds out of Mainland China generally are subject to a withholding tax of 5%, if transfers are made to Hong Kong and subject to Mainland China  Hong Kong tax treaty, and of 10% in other cases, and any further transfers to Sohu.com Inc. in the U.S. would generally be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at a rate of up to 35%. The PRC government also imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currencies out of China. We may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currencies. If we or any of our subsidiaries are unable to receive the revenues from our operations through these contractual or dividend arrangements, we may be unable to effectively fund any cash requirements we may have. 63 Table of Contents Activities of Internet content providers are or will be subject to additional PRC regulations, which have not yet been put into effect. Our operations may not be consistent with these new regulations when put into effect, and, as a result, we could be subject to severe penalties. The MIIT has stated that the activities of Internet content providers are subject to regulation by various PRC government authorities, depending on the specific activities conducted by the Internet content provider. Various government authorities have stated publicly that they are in the process of preparing new laws and regulations that will govern these activities. The areas of regulation currently include online advertising, online news reporting, online publishing, provision of online or mobile music, online securities trading, the provision of industry-specific (e.g., drug-related) information over the Internet and foreign investment in value-added telecommunication services. Other aspects of our online operations may be subject to additional regulations in the future. For example, our live social video platform enables users to perform real time musical acts, exchange information, interact with others and engage in various other online activities. We cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not issue new laws or regulations specifically regulating the operation of a real-time social video platform. Our operations might not be consistent with current laws and regulations or any such new regulations and, as a result, we could be subject to penalties. Regulation and censorship of information distribution in China may adversely affect our business. China has enacted regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news and other information. Furthermore, the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party takes the responsibility to censor news published in China to ensure, supervise and control a particular political ideology. In addition, the MIIT has published implementing regulations that subject online information providers to potential liability for contents included in their portals and the actions of subscribers and others using their systems, including liability for violation of PRC laws prohibiting the distribution of content deemed to be socially destabilizing. Furthermore, because many PRC laws, regulations and legal requirements with regard to the Internet are relatively new and untested, their interpretation and enforcement may involve significant uncertainty. In addition, the PRC legal system is a civil law system in which decided legal cases have limited binding force as legal precedents. As a result, in many cases an Internet platform operator may have difficulties determining the type of content that may subject it to liability. Periodically, the Ministry of Public Security has stopped the distribution over the Internet of information which it believes to be socially destabilizing. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security also has the authority to require any local Internet service provider to block any Website maintained outside China at its sole discretion. If the PRC government were to take action or exercise its authority to limit or eliminate the distribution of information through our portal or to limit or regulate current or future applications available to users of our portal, our business would be adversely affected. The State Secrecy Bureau, which is directly responsible for the protection of state secrets of all PRC government and Chinese Communist Party organizations, is authorized to block any Website it deems to be leaking state secrets or failing to meet the relevant regulations relating to the protection of state secrets in the distribution of online information. Under the applicable regulations, we may be held liable for any content transmitted on our portal. Furthermore, where the transmitted content clearly violates the laws of the PRC, we will be required to delete it. Moreover, if we consider transmitted content suspicious, we are required to report such content. We must also undergo computer security inspections, and if we fail to implement the relevant safeguards against security breaches, we may be shut down. In addition, under recently adopted regulations, Internet companies which provide bulletin board systems, chat rooms or similar services, such as our company, must apply for the approval of the State Secrecy Bureau. As the implementing rules of these new regulations have not been issued, we do not know how or when we will be expected to comply, or how our business will be affected by the application of these regulations. 64 Table of Contents We may be subject to the PRC governments ongoing crackdown on Internet pornographic content. The Chinese government has stringent prohibitions on online pornographic information and has launched several crackdowns on Internet pornography recently. On December 4, 2009, the MIIT and other three PRC government authorities jointly issued the Incentives Measures for Report of Pornographic, Obscene and Vulgar Messages on Internet and Mobile Media (the Anti-Pornography Notice) to further crackdown on online pornography. Pursuant to this Anti-Pornography Notice, rewards of up to RMB10, 000 will be provided to Internet users who report Websites that feature pornography, and a committee has been established to review such reports to determine an appropriate award. On April 13, 2014, the National Working Group on Anti-Pornography and three other PRC government authorities jointly issued the Anti-Pornography Proclamation, under which Internet service providers must immediately remove texts, images, video, advertisements and other information that contain pornographic content. The relevant government authority may order enterprises or individuals who flagrantly produce or disseminate pornographic content to stop conducting business, and may revoke relevant administrative permits. Although we require all users upon account registration to agree to our terms of service, which specify the types of content that are prohibited on our platform, and we have deleted from our relevant channels and communities all Web pages with material that we believe could reasonably be considered to be vulgar and have strengthened our internal censorship and supervision of links and content uploaded by users, it is possible that our users may engage in obscene conversations or activities on our platform that may be deemed illegal under PRC laws and regulations. For example, we provide a live social video platform for users, and because the video and audio communication on this platform is conducted in real time, we are unable to examine the content generated by our hosts and users on air before the content is streamed on the platform. There is no assurance that content considered vulgar by PRC government agencies will not appear in the future. We may be subject to fines or other disciplinary actions, including in serious cases suspension or revocation of the licenses necessary to operate our platform, if we are deemed to have facilitated the appearance of inappropriate content placed by third parties on our platform under PRC laws and regulations. In addition, if we are accused by the government of hosting vulgar content, our reputation could be adversely affected. Regulations relating to the online transmission of foreign films and TV dramas may adversely affect our online video business. On September 2, 2014, the SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Online Foreign Audiovisual Content (the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice), which requires that operators of audiovisual Websites obtain from the SAPPRFT a Film Public Screening Permit, TV Drama Distribution Permit, or TV Animation Distribution Permit for all foreign films and TV dramas before they are transmitted via the Internet in China. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice further stipulates that before any foreign films or TV dramas for transmission exclusively via the Internet are purchased after the promulgation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice, operators of audiovisual Websites must declare their annual purchasing plans with the SAPPRFT before the end of the year preceding the year of the intended broadcast and obtain the SAPPRFTs approval. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice also states that the number of foreign films and TV dramas to be purchased by an operator and transmitted via its Website in a single year may not exceed 30% of the total amount of the Chinese films and TV dramas purchased and transmitted by the same Website in the previous year. We rely heavily on foreign films and TV dramas to attract users and advertisers to our online video Internet platforms and, accordingly, the promulgation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice could have an adverse impact on our online video business. If we are not able to obtain the required SAPPRFT approval in time, there will be a delay in our ability to broadcast such foreign films and TV dramas on our Internet platforms and in our generation of advertising revenues from such films and TV dramas. We are also subject to the risk that users might access pirated versions of such films and TV dramas during any such delay, and become less likely to view them on our Internet platforms when they become available, which would cause our online traffic and advertising revenues to be lower than we expected. If we fail to obtain the required approval by the SAPPRFT, we may not be able to recoup the costs we spent in acquiring the broadcasting rights of, and marketing, those films and TV dramas. In addition, it could be necessary for us to recognize impairment charges related to foreign films and TV dramas we have purchased. The requirement of a minimum ratio of domestic video content to foreign-sourced content in the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice may require us to purchase more domestic video content in order for us to be permitted to maintain a sufficient portfolio of online foreign films and TV dramas. If, on the other hand, we respond to the minimum ratio requirement of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice by reducing our purchases of foreign films and TV dramas, our attraction to users, traffic or advertisers on our online video Internet platforms could be reduced, resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues. 65 Table of Contents Regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our ability to acquire PRC companies and could adversely affect our business. In July 2014, SAFE promulgated Circular 37, which replaced Circular 75, promulgated by SAFE in October 2005. Circular 37 requires PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with the local SAFE branch in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle, for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. PRC residents must also file amendments to their registrations in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on the ability to contribute additional capital to the PRC entity. It is unclear how these regulations will be interpreted and implemented as Circular 37 is newly issued and it is possible that some or all of our and Changyous shareholders who are PRC residents will not comply with all the requirements required by Circular 37 or related rules. Any future failure by any of our, or Changyous shareholders who is a PRC resident, or controlled by a PRC resident, to comply with relevant requirements under these regulations could subject us and Changyou to fines or sanctions imposed by the PRC government, including restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us and our ability to increase our investment in these subsidiaries. We may be subject to fines and legal sanctions if we or our employees who are PRC citizens fail to comply with PRC regulations relating to employee share options. Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC and the related Implementation Rules issued by the SAFE, all foreign exchange transactions involving an employee share incentive plan, share option plan or similar plan participated in by PRC citizens may be conducted only with the approval of the SAFE. Under the Notice of Issues Related to the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Listed Company (Offshore Share Incentives Rule), issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC citizens who are granted share options, restricted share units or restricted shares by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with the SAFE or its authorized branch and comply with a series of other requirements. The Offshore Share Incentives Rule also provides procedures for registration of incentive plans, the opening and use of special accounts for the purpose of participation in incentive plans, and the remittance of funds for exercising options and gains realized from such exercises and sales of such options or the underlying shares, both outside and inside the PRC. We, and any of our PRC employees or members of our board of directors who have been granted share options, restricted share units or restricted shares, are subject to the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control, the related Implementation Rules, and the Offshore Share Incentives Rule. Circular 37 was the first regulation to regulate the foreign exchange registration of a non-listed special purpose vehicles equity incentives granted to PRC residents, there remains uncertainty with respect to its implementation. If we, or any of our PRC employees or members of our board of directors who receive or hold options, restricted share units or restricted shares in us or any of our subsidiaries, fail to comply with these registration and other procedural requirements, we may be subject to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions. It may be difficult to enforce any civil judgments against us or our Board of Directors or officers, because most of our operating and/or fixed assets are located outside the United States. Although we are incorporated in the State of Delaware, most of our operating and fixed assets are located in the PRC. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments outside the United States obtained in actions brought against us in the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any state of the United States. In addition, certain of our directors and officers (principally based in the PRC) and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon those directors and officers, or to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any state of the United States. We have been advised by our PRC counsel that, in their opinion, there is doubt as to the enforceability in the PRC, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States or the securities laws of any state of the United States. 66 Table of Contents If the status of certain of our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs as High and New Technology Enterprises, Key National Software Enterprises or Software Enterprises is revoked or expires, we may have to pay additional taxes or make up any previously unpaid tax and may be subject to a higher tax rate, which would adversely affect our results of operations. The CIT Law imposes a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. High and New Technology Enterprises (HNTEs)will enjoy a favorable tax rate of 15% for three years, but need to re-apply after the end of the three-year period. If at any time during the three-year period the relevant tax bureau questions whether an enterprise continues to qualify as an HNTE, the enterprise can be subject to further tax examination and may not be able to continue to enjoy the preferential tax rate. Key National Software Enterprises can enjoy a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10% for two years, but need to re-apply after the end of the two-year period. Several of our PRC Subsidiaries and VIEs qualified as HNTEs and have enjoyed, and will enjoy reduced tax rates in 2015, 2016 and/or 2017 and one of our PRC Subsidiaries qualified as a Key National Software Enterprise in 2013 and 2014. In addition, the CIT Law and its implementing regulations provide that Software Enterprises can enjoy an income tax exemption for two years beginning with their first profitable year and a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years. A number of our PRC Subsidiaries qualified for exemptions or rate reductions in 2013, 2014 and/or 2015.There are uncertainties regarding future interpretation and implementation of the CIT Law and its implementing regulations. It is possible that the HNTE, Software Enterprise, and Key National Software Enterprise qualifications of our operating entities currently qualified as such, or their entitlement to an income tax exemption or refund of their VAT, will be challenged by higher level tax authorities and be repealed, or that there will be future implementing regulations that are inconsistent with current interpretation of the CIT Law. For example, according to a circular recently issued by the SAT, there will be new regulations promulgated by relevant authorities concerning new criteria to certify a Software Enterprise. Therefore, it is possible that the qualification of one or more of our PRC Subsidiaries or VIEs as a Software Enterprise will be challenged in the future or that such companies will not be able to take any further actions, such as re-application for Software Enterprise qualification, to enjoy such preferential tax treatments. If those operating entities cannot qualify for such income tax or VAT holidays, our effective income tax rate or VAT rate, as the case may be, will be increased significantly and we may have to pay additional income tax to make up the previously unpaid tax, which would reduce our net income. We may be deemed a PRC resident enterprise under the CIT Law and be subject to PRC taxation on our worldwide income. The CIT Law provides that enterprises established outside of China whose de facto management bodies are located within China are considered resident enterprises and are generally subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on their worldwide income (including dividend income received from subsidiaries). Under the Implementing Regulations for the Corporate Income Tax Law, de facto management body is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and treasury, and acquisition and disposition of properties and other assets of an enterprise. Since substantially all of our operational management is currently based in the PRC, it is unclear whether PRC tax authorities would require (or permit) us to be treated as a PRC-resident enterprise. If we are treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, we will be subject to PRC tax on our worldwide income at the 25% uniform tax rate, which could have an impact on our effective tax rate and an adverse effect on our net income and the results of operations, although dividends distributed from our PRC Subsidiaries to us could be exempted from Chinese dividend withholding tax, since such income is exempted under the CIT Law for PRC-resident recipients. Dividends payable by us to our foreign investors and profits on the sale of our shares may be subject to tax under PRC tax laws. Under the Implementing Regulations for the Corporate Income Tax Law, PRC income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are non-resident enterprises, not having an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which do have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent that such dividends have their sources within the PRC. Similarly, any profits realized through the transfer of shares by such investors are also subject to 10% PRC income tax if such profits are regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. It is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to our share, or the profits you may realize from the transfer of our shares, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax. If we are required under the Implementing Regulations for the Corporate Income Tax Law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors that are non-resident enterprises, or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively. Substantially all of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in RMB. The RMB is currently freely convertible under the current account, which includes dividends, trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, which includes foreign direct investment. 67 Table of Contents Currently, our China-Based Subsidiaries may purchase foreign exchange for settlement of current account transactions, including payment of dividends, without the approval of the SAFE. Our China-Based Subsidiaries may also retain foreign exchange in its current account (subject to a ceiling approved by the SAFE) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, the relevant PRC governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenues will be in the form of RMB, the existing and any future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside China, if any, or expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account are still subject to limitations and require approvals from the SAFE. This could affect our China-Based Subsidiaries ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing, including by means of loans or capital contributions from us. We may suffer currency exchange losses if the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, substantially all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. In July 2005, China reformed its exchange rate regime by establishing a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate will have some flexibility. Hence, considering the floating exchange rate regime, if the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, our revenues as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline in value. Also, we currently have outstanding loans from overseas banks that are denominated in U.S. dollars. To repay these loans, we will need to first convert our cash denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars. If the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, we will have to use a larger amount of cash in RMB for any such loan repayment. On May 19, 2007, the PBOC announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.3% to 0.5%. While the international reactions to the RMB revaluation and widening of the RMBs daily trading band have generally been positive, with the increased floating range of the RMBs value against foreign currencies, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term, depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued. On June 19, 2010, the PBOC announced that it has decided to proceed further with the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime to enhance the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate and that emphasis would be placed on reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. While so indicating its intention to make the RMBs exchange rate more flexible, the PBOC ruled out any sharp fluctuations in the currency or a one-off adjustment. On April 16, 2012, the PBOC enlarged the floating band of RMBs trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.5% to 1% around the middle rate released by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System each day. In February 2014, the center point of the currencys official trading band hit 6.1146, representing appreciation of more than 11.7% since June 19, 2010. On March 17, 2014, the PBOC announced a policy to further expand the maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market to 2%. In 2015, the RMB depreciated significantly. The center point of the currencys official trading band was 6.1265 in January, and was 6.4465 in December, which contributed to a decline in our 2015 revenues, which we report in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. In addition, there are very limited hedging transactions available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, if at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into U.S. dollars. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be so. The initial public offering price of our common stock in July 2000 was $13.00 per share. The trading price of our common stock subsequently dropped to a low of $0.52 per share on April 9, 2001. During 2014, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a low of $42.03 per share to a high of $87.68 per share. On February 23, 2016, the closing price of our common stock was $44.58 per share. In addition, the NASDAQ Global Select Market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of technology companies, and particularly Internet-related companies. 68 Table of Contents The price for our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted share options or other stock awards. We are controlled by a small group of our existing stockholders, whose interests may differ from other stockholders. Dr. Charles Zhang beneficially owns approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and is our largest stockholder. Our Chief Executive Officer, together with our other executive officers and members of our Board of Directors, beneficially own approximately 21% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly these stockholders acting together will have significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to the stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. They will also have significant influence in preventing or causing a change in control. In addition, without the consent of these stockholders, we may be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of the other stockholders. Anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our certificate of incorporation could delay or deter a change in control. Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as various provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may make it more difficult to acquire our company or effect a change in control of our company, even if an acquisition or change in control would be in the interest of our stockholders or if an acquisition or change in control would provide our stockholders with a premium for their shares over then current market prices. For example, our certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our Board of Directors into two classes with staggered two-year terms and provides that stockholders have no right to take action by written consent and may not call special meetings of stockholders, each of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board in connection with, or obtain any necessary stockholder approval for, a proposed acquisition or change in control. The power of our Board of Directors to designate and issue shares of preferred stock could have an adverse effect on holders of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock, having rights and preferences as the board may determine, and any such designations and issuances could have an adverse effect on the rights of holders of common stock. Registered public accounting firms in China, including our independent registered public accounting firm, are not inspected by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which deprives us and our investors of the benefits of such inspection. Auditors of companies whose shares are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and traded publicly in the United States, including our independent registered public accounting firm, must be registered with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB) and are required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards applicable to auditors. Our independent registered public accounting firm is located in, and organized under the laws of, the PRC, which is a jurisdiction where the PCAOB, notwithstanding the requirements of U.S. law, is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. In May 2013, PCAOB announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Enforcement Cooperation with the CSRC and the PRC Ministry of Finance, which establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations undertaken by PCAOB, the CSRC or the PRC Ministry of Finance in the United States and the PRC, respectively. PCAOB continues to be in discussions with the CSRC and the PRC Ministry of Finance to permit joint inspections in the PRC of audit firms that are registered with PCAOB and audit Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of our independent registered public accounting firm. As a result, we and investors in our common stock are deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firms audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential investors in our stock to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. 69 Table of Contents If additional remedial measures are imposed on the Big Four PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in administrative proceedings brought by the SEC alleging the firms failure to meet specific criteria set by the SEC, we could be unable to timely file future financial statements in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In December 2012, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the Big Four PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, alleging that these firms had violated U.S. securities laws and the SECs rules and regulations thereunder by failing to provide to the SEC the firms audit work papers with respect to certain PRC-based companies that are publicly traded in the United States. On January 22, 2014, the ALJ presiding over the matter rendered an initial decision that each of the firms had violated the SECs rules of practice by failing to produce audit workpapers to the SEC. The initial decision censured each of the firms and barred them from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The Big Four PRC-based accounting firms appealed the ALJs initial decision to the SEC. The ALJs decision does not take effect unless and until it is endorsed by the SEC. On February 6, 2015, the four China-based accounting firms each agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC and audit U.S.-listed companies. The settlement required the firms to follow detailed procedures and to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC. If future document productions fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. While we cannot predict if the SEC will further review the four China-based accounting firms compliance with specified criteria or if the results of such a review would result in the SEC imposing penalties such as suspensions or restarting the administrative proceedings, if the accounting firms are subject to additional remedial measures, our ability to file our financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could be impacted. A determination that we have not timely filed financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could ultimately lead to the delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ or the termination of the registration of our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our common stock in the United States. Risks Related to Our Financing Activities Sogous status as a controlled, but less than wholly-owned, subsidiary of us could have an adverse effect on us. Given that Sogou is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of us, it is possible that our and Sogous interests could diverge in the future as we may need to consider the interests of other shareholders of Sogou. If Sogous interests differ from, or are contrary to, our interests, our business operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our search business does not break even or achieve profitability and we are unable to raise additional capital, we could be forced to suspend the operation of our search business, and even if we were able to raise additional capital, our interest in Sogou would be further diluted. Moreover, since Sohu does not hold 100% of Sogou, certain transactions between Sohu and Sogou, as well as between their subsidiaries and VIEs, might expose Sohu.com Inc. to up to 35% U.S. corporate income tax. In addition, certain transactions entered into by Sogou and its subsidiaries and VIEs, such as investing in U.S. properties, might expose Sohu.com Inc. to the risk that these will be treated as transactions subject to U.S. tax. If Sogou were to pay a dividend to its shareholders, we, as one of the shareholders of Sogou, could be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at up to 35% on the portion of the dividend it received. Changyous status as a public company could have an adverse impact on Sohu. Changyous American depositary shares, or ADSs, are listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As a separate publicly-listed company, Changyou may have interests that differ from, or may even be contrary to, those of Sohu, and we may have disagreements on certain matters. Our business might be adversely affected by any such disagreements. Changyous status as a publicly-listed company may have adverse U.S. tax consequences for us. As the Sohu Group has two listed companies, Sohu.com Inc. and Changyou.com Limited, which are regarded as separate legal entities for U.S. tax purposes, certain transactions between these two companies, as well as between their subsidiaries and VIEs, might expose Sohu.com Inc. to U.S. corporate income tax at a rate of 34%. Moreover, certain types of transactions by Changyou and its subsidiaries and VIEsinvesting in U.S. properties, for examplemight expose Sohu.com Inc. to the risk that the transactions will be subject to U.S. tax. If Changyou pays dividends, Sohu.com Inc., as one of the shareholders of Changyou, might be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at a rate of up to 35% for the dividends received. Under certain circumstances, when we sell Changyou ordinary shares originally held by us at a price higher than our U.S. tax basis, a portion of the proceeds will be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at a rate of up to 35%. 70 Table of Contents Risks Related to Changyou.com Limited Risks Relating to Changyous Business and Industry Overall Risks The markets for Changyous products and services are evolving rapidly and significantly, which makes evaluating its business and prospects difficult. Changyous business and the industry in which it operates are evolving rapidly. Changyou was incorporated on August 6, 2007 in the Cayman Islands and began its online game business as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of us. In 2007 we transferred all of our PC game business to Changyou. In 2011 Changyou acquired 7Road and began generating Web game revenues. In 2012, Changyou began to develop and operate mobile games, but did not begin to generate any significant revenues from mobile games until late in 2014 when Changyou launched TLBB 3D. In August 2015, as revenues from Changyous Web games Wartune and DDTank had begun to decline, Changyou sold 7Roads operating entity Shenzhen 7Road, and as a result Changyou has no remaining significant Web games in operation. In 2011, Changyou began to expand into the platform channel business with its acquisition of the 17173.com Website, which operates Changyous online advertising business, from us and acquired the entities operating Changyous cinema advertising business. In December 2013, Changyou acquired RaidCall, which operates free social communication software; and in July 2014 Changyou acquired a majority interest in MoboTap, which operates the Dolphin Browser. However, Changyous acquisitions of RaidCall and MoboTap were not successful, as expected synergies did not materialize. Changyous revenues from platform channel services other than from online advertising on the 17173.com Website have been relatively insignificant. Changyous past successes in its online games business with PC games may not provide a meaningful basis for you to evaluate its current business and prospects, as game players increasingly migrate from personal computers to mobile devices to access online games and the relative popularity of PC games continues to decline. In response to such rapid migration, Changyou has devoted and Changyou expects to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of its mobile games as a critical component of its business strategy. However, Changyous mobile games strategy has not been proven, and presents very different challenges from those presented in the past by its operation of PC games and Web games. We cannot be certain that Changyou will be successful in its efforts to continue to expand into mobile games. Despite the success of Changyous mobile game TLBB 3D, the popularity of, and the revenues generated from, the game declined through 2015, and Changyou has not been able to generate comparable revenues from new mobile games to sustain or grow its mobile game business. You should also consider additional risks and uncertainties that may be experienced by companies operating in a rapidly developing and evolving industry. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to Changyous ability to:  raise Changyous brand recognition and game player loyalty;  develop, license or operate new games that are appealing to game players; adapt to new trends and game player tastes; and meet Changyous expected timetable for launches of new games, and that, if they are successful, have acceptably long lifespans and result in an acceptable level of profit for Changyou;  successfully adapt to evolving business models, industry trends and market environments by developing and investing in new business strategies, products, services and technologies, including new games;  arrange for its mobile games to be distributed through popular mobile application stores with commercial terms, including revenue-sharing arrangements, that are favorable enough to Changyou and allow it to achieve an acceptable level of profit from the games;  integrate new technologies, businesses and personnel of acquired entities, and generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs and expenses of such acquisitions;  maintain or expand its marketing efforts to attract more game players to its games and to the game information portal of the 17173.com Website in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive business environment, and generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs and expenses of such marketing efforts; and  maintain and strengthen the 17173.com Website and its leading position among game information portals in China, particularly in view of the rapid emergence of mobile games and the decline in the relative popularity of PC games and Web games as users increasingly switch to mobile devices. If Changyou does not adapt its business to address these risks and uncertainties, its ability to continue its past success or to expand its business in the future is likely to be impeded. 71 Table of Contents Changyous business may not succeed in a highly competitive market. Competition in the online game market in China is becoming increasingly intense. Changyou competes principally with the following three groups of competitors in China:  online game developers and/or operators in China that are publicly traded in the United States and in Hong Kong, including Tencent Holdings Limited, NetEase.com, Inc., Kingsoft Corporation Limited, IGG Inc. and NetDragon Websoft Inc.;  other companies in China devoted to game development and/or operation that are publicly traded in China, such as Kalends Inc., Ourpalm Corporate limited, Century Cruises (formerly known as Giant Interactive Group Inc.), or privately-held companies, usually backed by venture capital or private equity, including Da Xing (formerly known as Perfect World Co., Ltd.) and Shulong Technologies (formerly known as Shanda Games Limited); and  international competitors. In addition, there are many venture-backed private companies focusing on online game development and operation, further intensifying the competition. Many of Changyous competitors aggressively hire talent for game development, and have been increasing spending on marketing for games, bidding for licenses of games, penetrating into the mobile game market, and releasing new software for mobile devices to attract a growing number of game players that access Internet products and services through mobile devices. Increased competition may make it difficult for Changyou to retain its existing employees and attract new employees, and to sustain its growth. The17173.com Website derives revenue primarily from providing online advertising services to advertisers that develop, operate and distribute PC games. As the market demand for PC games continues to decline, the 17173.com Website faces intense competition, particularly from mobile application stores and other Internet platforms through which game players access mobile games, for advertising business targeting online players of mobile games. Changyou competes with other game information portals, such as duowan.com, operated by YY Inc., and game.qq.com, operated by Tencent Holdings Limited, and other Internet portals which have, or may over time be able to build, competitive advantages over Changyou in terms of:  greater brand recognition among game players and advertising clients;  larger user and customer bases;  more extensive and well developed marketing and sales networks;  more attractive mobile versions of their game information portals and more extensive mobile game-related products and services in response to the rapid migration of users of Internet services from PCs to mobile devices, such as tablets and mobile phones; and  substantially greater financial and technical resources. If Changyou is unable to sustain and enhance its brand recognition, provide quality products and services, provide extensive and high quality mobile game-related products and services to meet game players needs, and meet other difficult technological and business challenges, then its users and advertising clients may become dissatisfied and move to a competitors portal for products and services, its user base may decrease and its ability to generate advertising revenues on its 17173.com Website may decline as a result. In order to compete effectively in the PRC, as well as in the worldwide market, Changyou must continue to invest in research and development, to enhance its technology and its existing games, advertising and other services, and to introduce new game products and services in order for it to adapt to industry trends and shifting demands of game players and advertising clients and to remain competitive. If Changyous products and services are not responsive to the needs of its game players and advertisers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market, or if its competitors are more successful than Changyou is in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining game players and advertisers, Changyou may not be able to recoup such expenditures. Changyous business could suffer if Changyou does not successfully manage any future growth. Changyou experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion through 2013 that placed strain on its management personnel, systems and resources. In addition, to accommodate any future growth, Changyou anticipates that it will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, including procedures and controls, improvement of its accounting and other internal management systems and security systems related to the foregoing, all of which require substantial management efforts and financial resources. Changyou will also need to continue to train, manage and motivate its workforce, and manage its relationships with its third-party operators, distributors and service providers and its game player base. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort and skills and the incurrence of additional expenditures. Changyou may not be able to efficiently or effectively implement its growth strategies and manage the growth of its operations, and any failure to do so may limit its future growth and hamper its business strategy. 72 Table of Contents Changyou may not be able to avoid future slowing of its revenue growth or future losses. Changyous revenues grew significantly in a relatively short period of time prior to 2014, but its revenue growth stalled in 2014 and 2015. Primarily due to the commercial success of TLBB, its revenues grew from $623.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $737.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. However, its revenues increased only slightly to $755.3 million and to $761.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. Its net income attributable to Changyou.com Limited decreased from $282.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $268.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, Changyou suffered a net loss attributable to Changyou.com Limited of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and sustained operating losses for each quarter of 2014. Although Changyous net income attributable to Changyou.com Limited was $212.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the commercial success of its mobile game TLBB 3D, a decrease in its sales and marketing expenses, and a decrease in its salary and benefit expenses as a result of a reduction in its workforce, Changyou is not likely to experience rates of revenue growth in the future similar to those that it experienced prior to 2014. Changyou also may experience declines in its revenues or net losses in the future due to a number of factors, including, among other things, the continued decline in TLBBs and TLBB 3Ds revenues and profitability, the uncertain level of popularity of its future games (particularly its future mobile games as users increasingly switch to mobile devices), uncertainty as to its ability to develop and launch mobile high-quality games that are commercially successful and the relatively higher game development and distribution costs generally associated with such games; the need to expend greater amounts in order to develop or acquire new games, technologies, assets, and businesses, and uncertainty as to its ability to integrate such newly acquired games, technologies, assets and businesses. Accordingly, you should not rely on the results of any prior period as an indication of Changyous future financial and operating performance. Changyous previous and any future acquisitions and/or strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on its ability to manage its business and may also result in impairment charges. Changyou has made acquisitions of, and may potentially acquire in the future, technologies, businesses or assets that are complementary to its business and/or enter into strategic alliances in order to leverage its position in the Chinese online game market and expand its business domestically and internationally. Such acquisitions or strategic alliances may expose Changyou to potential risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technologies, businesses and personnel including its continued reliance on the management teams of the acquisition targets to operate the acquired businesses, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the diversion of management attention and resources from its existing business, and the inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions or strategic alliances. Any difficulties encountered in the acquisition and strategic alliance process may have an adverse effect on Changyous ability to manage its business. In addition, acquired businesses may not perform to Changyous expectations for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel or key clients, and Changyous strategic focus may change. As a result, Changyou may not realize the benefits it anticipated. If Changyou fails to integrate acquired technologies, businesses and assets or realize the expected benefits, Changyou may not receive a return on its investment and its transaction costs for such acquisitions. The benefits of an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition or investment will produce the intended benefits, which could adversely affect its business and operating results. Acquisitions could result in contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill and/or intangible assets, which could adversely affect Changyous results of operations. For example, in December 2013, Changyou acquired RaidCall with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies with Changyous online game business; in November 2013 Changyou acquired Beijing Doyo Internet Technology Co., Ltd., or Doyo, with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies with Changyous online advertising business, and in July 2014 Changyou acquired MoboTap, which operates the Dolphin Browser, with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies with Changyous platform channel business. In 2014 Changyou recognized a $33.8 million impairment loss for goodwill and a $15.3 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets related to RaidCall, in 2015 Changyou recognized a $29.6 million impairment loss for goodwill and an $8.9 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets relating to the Dolphin Browser, and in 2015 Changyou sold Doyo and recognized a $1.9 million impairment loss for goodwill, as a result of Changyous managements conclusion that the expected synergies would not materialize. Changyou is dependent upon its management and upon its key development and technical personnel; Changyous business may be severely disrupted if it loses the services of any of them. Changyous future success depends substantially on the services of the members of its management and its key development and technical personnel, such as its Co-Chief Executive Officers Carol Yu and Dewen Chen. If one or more of the members of its management or key development or technical personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, Changyou might not be able to replace them easily or at all. If any of the members of Changyous management or its key employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company, Changyou may lose know-how, key professionals, staff members and suppliers. These members of its management and key employees could develop and operate games or platforms that could compete with and take game players and users away from Changyous existing and future games and platforms. Although each of members of Changyous management and key personnel has entered into an employment agreement with non-competition provisions, these non-competition provisions may not be enforceable in China. 73 Table of Contents Risk Related to Online Games There are uncertainties regarding the future growth of the online game industry in China. The online game industry, from which Changyou derives most of its revenues, is a relatively new and rapidly evolving industry. The growth of the online game industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of Changyous games are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Changyous future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the online game industry, many of which are beyond Changyous control, including:  whether the online game industry, particularly in China and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, continues to grow and the rate of any such growth;  the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment, particularly games on console systems, which are already popular in developed countries and may gain popularity in China;  growth in users of Internet and broadband and penetration in China and other markets in which Changyou offers its games, and the rate of any such growth;  whether recent declines in the use of personal computers and growth in users of mobile devices (such as smart phones and tablets) in general, and for purposes of accessing online games in particular, continue or accelerate in China and other markets in which Changyou offers its games;  changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; and  general economic conditions in China, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending, such as the slowdown in Chinas economic growth that occurred between the first quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2012 and during 2014 and 2015. There is no assurance that online games in general will continue to be popular in China or elsewhere. If the current decline in the popularity of PC games continues or accelerates as users increasingly switch to mobile devices, Changyous revenues from its PC games may decrease significantly; and if the PC games that Changyou has launched, or expects to launch in the future, are not successful, Changyou may not be able to recoup the investments in its development and marketing of those games. A decline in the popularity of Changyous online games in general, and of the PC games that Changyou operates in particular, would adversely affect its business and prospects. Changyou currently depends on TLBB for a substantial portion of its revenues, and any continued decrease in the popularity of TLBB or interruption in its operation would adversely affect Changyous results of operations. Changyou currently relies on TLBB for a substantial portion of its revenues. Changyou launched TLBB in May 2007 and TLBB is unlikely to sustain its current level of popularity over time. Despite Changyous efforts to improve TLBB, its game players have nevertheless lost interest in it over time as the relative popularity of PC games that are accessed through personal computers continues to decline and its popularity, revenues and profitability have continued to decline. See Changyou may not be successful in operating and improving its games to satisfy the changing demands of game players. To prolong TLBBs lifespan and slow down the pace of its decline, Changyou needs to continually improve and update it on a timely basis with new features that appeal to existing game players and attract new game players. If Changyou fails to improve and update TLBB on a timely basis, or if its competitors introduce more popular games, including mobile games, catering to its game player base, the decline in TLBBs popularity can be expected to accelerate, which would cause Changyous revenues to decrease at a faster pace. Furthermore, if there are any interruptions in TLBBs operation due to unexpected server interruptions, network failures or other factors, game players may be prevented or deterred from making purchases of virtual items, which could also cause significant decreases in Changyous revenues. Changyous new games may attract game players away from its existing games. Changyous new games may attract game players away from its existing games. For example, with its increasingly diversified game portfolio, we cannot assure you that Changyous TLBB game players will not be attracted to play other newly launched games, including its new mobile games, instead of TLBB. If this occurs, it will decrease Changyous existing games player bases, which could in turn make these games less attractive to other game players, resulting in decreased revenues from its existing games. Game players who switch from playing Changyous existing games to its new games may also spend less money to purchase virtual items in its new games than they would have spent if they had continued playing its existing games, resulting in an adverse effect on its overall revenues. In addition game players switching from playing Changyous existing PC games to its new mobile games could cause its online games income to be relatively lower, as Changyous mobile games tend to enjoy relatively lower profits as a result of revenue-sharing arrangements. 74 Table of Contents If the market demand for PC games in general, and for the PC games that Changyou operates in particular, continues to decline and the number of game players of PC games continues to decrease, Changyous online game business and prospects may be adversely affected. A substantial portion of Changyous online game revenues is generated from its TLBB. However, the popularity of PC games continues to decline and an increasing number of online game developers are delaying or suspending their plans to develop and launch new PC games, as game players increasingly switch to mobile devices to access online games. It has become increasingly difficult for PC game developers and operators to retain existing players of their games and the number of game players who are willing to spend time and money to play new PC games continues to decrease. If this downward trend continues or accelerates, it may make it increasingly difficult for Changyous existing PC games in general, and TLBB in particular, to maintain their popularity and for its new PC games to ever become commercially successful; the game player base of Changyous PC games in general, and of TLBB in particular, may continue to shrink, which would increase its costs to acquire and retain players of its PC games and would have a negative impact on its online game revenues. As mobile devices such as tablets, mobile phones and other devices other than personal computers are increasingly used to access online games, Changyou must continue to acquire or develop increasing numbers of mobile games that work on such devices. Devices other than personal computers, such as mobile phones and tablets, are used increasingly in China and in overseas markets. We believe that, for its business to be successful, Changyou will need to continue to develop versions of its existing games and any future games that work well with such devices. The games that Changyou develops for such devices may not function as smoothly as its existing games, and may not be attractive to game players in other ways. In addition, manufacturers of such devices may establish restrictive conditions for developers of applications to be used on such devices, and as a result Changyous games may not work well, or at all, on such devices. As new devices are released or updated, Changyou may encounter problems in developing versions of its games for use on such devices and may need to devote significant resources to the development, support, and maintenance of games for such devices. Since 2014 Changyou has been investing, and it expects to continue to invest, significant amounts in the acquisition, development, promotion and operation of games for mobile devices. If Changyou is unable to successfully expand the types of devices on which its existing and future games are available, or if mobile versions of games that Changyou develops for such devices do not function well or are not attractive to users and game players, or if the mobile games that Changyou has launched, or expects to launch in the future, are not successful, Changyou may not be able to maintain or increase its revenues and recoup its investments in the mobile market. Changyous business will suffer if it is unable to develop successful games, particularly high-quality games, for mobile devices, successfully monetize mobile games Changyou develops or acquires and maintain for a reasonable period the popularity and revenue levels of any mobile games that are successful. Developing games, particularly high-quality games for mobile devices is an important component of Changyous strategy. Chinas mobile games market has been dominated by a small number of high quality games, which collectively generate a substantial majority of the total revenues and profits of all mobile games in the market and are likely to maintain their popularity and revenue levels for relatively longer lifespans. Changyou has devoted and Changyou expects to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of its mobile games, particularly those that have the potential to become high quality games. We cannot guarantee that Changyou will be able to develop games, and particularly high quality games, that appeal to players. In addition, Changyou may encounter difficulty in integrating features on games developed for mobile devices that a sufficient number of players will pay for or otherwise sufficiently monetizing mobile games. If Changyou is unable to develop successful high quality games, or implement successful monetization strategies for its mobile games in general, its ability to grow revenue and its financial performance will be negatively affected. Changyous ability to successfully develop games for mobile devices will depend on its ability to:  expand the portfolio of mobile games, and particularly high quality games, that Changyou develops in-house and licenses from third-party developers;  effectively develop new mobile games for multiple mobile operating systems and mobile devices;  effectively cross-market mobile games to players of its current PC games and mobile games ;  anticipate and effectively respond to the growing number of players switching to mobile games, the changing mobile landscape and the interests of players;  attract, retain and motivate talented game designers, product managers and engineers with experience in developing games for mobile devices; 75 Table of Contents  minimize launch delays and cost overruns on the development of new games;  effectively monetize mobile games without degrading the social game experience for its players;  develop games that provide for a compelling and optimal user experience through existing and developing third-party technologies, including third-party software and middleware utilized by its players; and  acquire and successfully integrate high- quality mobile game assets, personnel or companies. Further, even if Changyou develops or acquires license rights to a mobile game that is successful, the games lifespan may be short, as even successful mobile games tend to have less sustained user loyalty than do successful PC games and Web games. For example, the revenues generated from Changyous mobile game, TLBB 3D, which was launched in October 2014, declined sequentially through 2015 after its debut, which is typical for a mobile game. In view of the uncertain lifespans of mobile games, it is necessary for Changyou to invest considerable sums in order to have a number of mobile games, and particularly mobile games that have the potential to become high-quality, hit games, in its pipeline. If Changyou is unable to succeed in developing or acquiring new mobile games in general, and high quality games in particular, that are successful and maintaining for a reasonable period the popularity and revenue levels of any mobile games that Changyou develops or acquires that are successful, Changyou may not be able to recoup its development and acquisition costs and its ability to expand its business in the future is likely to be impeded. Changyou may not be able to distribute its mobile games through its desired Internet platforms, its profits from any successful mobile games can be expected to be relatively lower than the profits Changyou has enjoyed historically from PC games and its mobile game revenues are subject to additional risks as Changyou relies on mobile application stores to collect payments from players of its mobile games. Changyou may not be able to arrange for its mobile games to be distributed through its desired popular third-party mobile application stores with commercial terms, including revenue-sharing arrangements that are favorable enough to it and allow it to achieve an acceptable level of profit from the games. Changyous profits from mobile games, even if the games are successful, are likely to be relatively lower than the profits it generates from PC games, because, in order to gain access for its games on mobile application stores, Changyou must enter into revenue-sharing arrangements that generally result in lower profit margins than those generated from its PC games. Changyou relies on mobile application stores to collect payments from game players for their purchases of its virtual items and to pay to Changyou pre-agreed revenue-sharing amounts. If mobile application stores cease to offer Changyous games over their platforms, change their user payment policies, such as return policies, or fail to make revenue-sharing payments that are due to Changyou, Changyous revenues will be adversely affected. In addition, the iOS-based mobile application store allows game players to use foreign currency to purchase virtual items or game points in Changyous games, and the store pays to Changyou pre-agreed revenue-sharing amounts after converting the foreign-currency denominated revenues from such purchases into RMB using an exchange rate effective at the time of the payment. Since there is usually a delay between the time of a game players purchase and the time when the store pays Changyou, if the foreign currency used has depreciated against the RMB during the delay Changyou will receive lower share-sharing amounts at the time of the payment than Changyou would have received if the payment had been made at the time of the game players purchase. There are risks associated with Changyous licensing of rights to use the titles, characters, themes and story lines of popular works or stories in order to adapt them for its online games. Changyou frequently obtains license rights to the titles, characters, themes and story lines of popular works in order to adapt online games from such works. It can be difficult to identify a sufficient number of popular works that are suitable for adaptation for use in online games, and Changyou faces significant competition for the rights to such works from other online game companies that also adapt their online games from popular Chinese works. For example, under Changyous existing license agreements with Louis Cha, a famous author of Chinese martial arts novels, Changyou has the exclusive right to adapt certain of his novels into online games, such as its TLBB and mobile game TLBB 3D, and to operate the games in the China market. Changyou also has a non-exclusive license to operate, and to sublicense the right to operate, such games outside of China. After the expiration of the terms of its existing license agreements with Mr. Cha or other holders of copyrights, Changyou may not be able to renew the agreements with commercial terms that are favorable to it, if at all. In addition, obtaining license rights to suitable works can involve significant expenses, and if games that Changyou adapts from particular works are not popular and commercial successes, Changyou will be unable to recoup such expenses. Obtaining such rights and adapting such works for mobile games present additional risks, because of the possibly relatively short lifespans of mobile games. 76 Table of Contents Changyou relies on recorded data for game revenue recognition and tracking of game players consumption patterns of virtual items. If its data systems fail to operate effectively, such failure will not only affect the completeness and accuracy of its revenue recognition, but also its ability to design and improve virtual items that appeal to game players. Changyous game operation revenues are generated through the direct online sale of game points and sale of its prepaid game cards, and its recognition of those revenues depends on such factors as whether the virtual items purchased by game players are considered consumable or perpetual. Changyou relies on its data systems to record and monitor the purchase and consumption of virtual items by its game players and the types of virtual items purchased. If its data systems fail to accurately record the purchase and consumption information of the virtual items, Changyou may not be able to accurately recognize its revenues. In addition, various factors affect the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items, such as the average period that game players typically play Changyous games and other game player behavior patterns, the acceptance and popularity of expansion packs, promotional events launched and market conditions, and Changyou relies on its billing systems to capture such historical game player behavior patterns and other information. If such information is not accurately recorded, or if Changyou does not have sufficient information due to the short operating history of any of its games, Changyou will not be able to accurately estimate the lives of, or the estimated average period the game players play its games with respect to, the perpetual virtual items, which will also affect its ability to accurately recognize its revenues from such perpetual virtual items. If Changyous data systems were damaged by system failure, network interruption, or virus infection, or attacked by a hacker, the integrity of data would be compromised, which could adversely affect its revenue recognition and the completeness and accuracy of its recognized revenues. In addition, Changyou relies on its data systems to record game player purchase and consumption patterns, based on which Changyou improves its existing virtual items and designs new virtual items. For example, Changyou intends to increase development efforts on the number and variety of virtual items that its game players like to purchase, and Changyou may also adjust prices accordingly. If its data systems fail to record data accurately, its ability to improve existing virtual items or design new virtual items that are appealing to its game players may be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect its revenues. Changyou could be liable for breaches in the security of its online payment platforms and those of third parties with whom Changyou transacts business, and any such breaches could cause its customers to lose confidence in the integrity of the payment systems that Changyou uses. Currently, Changyou sells a substantial portion of its virtual game points and prepaid game cards to its game players through third-party online payment platforms. In these online transactions, secure transmission of confidential information, such as customers credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses, over public networks is essential if Changyou is to maintain its consumers confidence in it. In addition, Changyou expects that an increasing amount of its sales will be conducted over the Internet as a result of the growing use of online payment systems. As a result, the risk of associated online crime will increase. Changyous current security measures and those of the third-party online payment platforms with whom Changyou transacts business may not be adequate. Changyou must be prepared to increase its security measures and efforts so that its game players have confidence in the reliability of the online payment systems that it uses, which will require Changyou to incur additional expense. Such increased security measures may still not make its online payment systems completely safe. In addition, Changyou does not have control over the security measures of its third-party online payment vendors. Breaches in the security of online payment systems that Changyou uses could expose it to litigation and liability for failing to secure confidential customer information, and could harm its reputation, ability to attract customers and ability to encourage customers to purchase virtual items. Changyou derives an increasing portion of its revenues from online games that Changyou licenses from or jointly develops with third-party developers; any failure of third-party developers to fulfill their obligations under Changyous license or joint operation agreements with them could have an adverse effect on Changyous operation of and revenues from those games, and Changyous revenue-sharing arrangements with those third-party developers reduce its profits from the operation of those games. Changyou derives an increasing portion of its revenues from PC games and mobile games that Changyou licenses from, or jointly develops with, third-party developers. Under its license and joint development agreements for these games, Changyou relies on the third-party developers to provide game updates, enhancements and new versions, provide materials and other assistance in promoting the games and resolving game programming errors and issues with bots and other intrusions. Any failure of third-party developers to provide game updates, enhancements and new versions in a timely manner and that are appealing to game players, and provide assistance that enables Changyou to effectively promote the games could adversely affect the game-playing experience of Changyous game players, damage its reputation, or shorten the life-spans of those games, any of which could result in the loss of game players, acceleration of Changyous amortization of the license fees it has paid for those games, or a decrease in or elimination of its revenues from those games. 77 Table of Contents In addition, Changyous revenue-sharing arrangements for games that Changyou licenses from or jointly develops with third-party developers provide Changyou with relatively less profit than games that Changyou develops in-house, and in some cases Changyou may not be able to recoup its investments in such games. Moreover, to secure the rights to games from third-party developers, Changyou often must pay up-front fees and also commit to pay additional fees in the future. Similarly, Changyou also has invested in mobile game development studios in order to assure access to an extensive pipeline of mobile games. Changyou often must make such commitments and investments without knowing whether the games Changyou is licensing or jointly developing will be successful and generate sufficient revenues to enable Changyou to recoup its costs or for the games to be profitable. Furthermore, for games that Changyou licenses from or jointly develops with third parties, Changyou may not have access to the game source codes during the initial period of the license, or at all. Without the source codes, Changyou has to rely on the licensors to provide updates and enhancements during the initial period, giving it less control over the quality and timeliness of updates and enhancements. If Changyous game players are not satisfied with the level of services they receive, they may choose to not play the games, leading to a decrease in Changyous revenues. Changyou faces significant risks and incur additional costs when it licenses to, or jointly operates with, third-party operators its games. If Changyou fails to manage these risks, its growth and business prospects could be adversely affected. Changyou currently, and expects to continue to, exclusively license to, or jointly operate with, third-party operators some of its games, including an increasing number of its mobile games. Negotiating with potential third-party operators and joint operators and managing Changyous relationships with the third-party operators and joint operators all require substantial management effort and skill and the incurrence of significant expenses. There are additional risks associated with the licensing, direct or joint operation of Changyous games, including:  difficulties in identifying appropriate markets;  difficulties in identifying and maintaining good relationships with licensees or joint operators who are knowledgeable about, and can effectively operate Changyous games in markets;  difficulties in maintaining the reputation of Changyou and its games when Changyous games are operated by licensees or joint operators in markets pursuant to their own standards;  changes in the political, regulatory or economic conditions in a foreign country or region, or public policies toward online games; and  difficulties in protecting Changyous intellectual property. Additional risks associated with the licensing or direct or joint operation of Changyous games overseas include:  significant costs for translation of its games into the local languages of, or customization of its games for, the overseas markets in which Changyou plans to license or jointly operate its games;  difficulties relating to compliance with the different legal requirements and commercial terms, such as game export regulatory procedures, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, in the overseas markets in which Changyou licenses or directly or jointly operates its games;  exposure to different regulatory systems governing the protection of intellectual property and the regulation of online games, the Internet and the export of technology;  costs for compliance with different legal requirements and commercial terms in overseas markets;  difficulties in verifying revenues generated from Changyous games by its licensees for purposes of determining royalties payable to Changyou;  difficulties and delays in contract enforcement and collection of receivables through the use of foreign legal systems;  the risk that regulatory authorities in foreign countries or administrative regions may impose withholding taxes, or place restrictions on repatriation of Changyous profits; and  fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If Changyou is unable to manage these risks and control these costs effectively, its ability to license or operate its games in China or in regions and countries outside of Mainland China, either directly or jointly with third-party joint operators, may be impaired. 78 Table of Contents Changyou may not be successful in operating and improving its games to satisfy the changing demands of game players. Changyou depends on purchases and continual consumption of virtual items by its game players to generate revenues, which in turn depend on the continued attractiveness of its games to the game players and their satisfactory game-playing experience. Various issues could arise that would cause its games to be less attractive to its game players or could limit the continued attractiveness of its games. For example:  Changyou may fail to provide game updates, expansion packs and other enhancements in a timely manner due to technologies, resources or other factors;  Changyous game updates, expansion packs and new versions may contain program errors, and their installation may create other unforeseen issues that adversely affect the game-playing experience;  Changyou may fail to timely respond and/or resolve complaints from its game players;  Changyou may fail to eliminate computer bots which can disrupt its games smooth operation and reduce the attractiveness of its games; and  Changyous game updates, expansion packs and other enhancements may change rules or other aspects of its games that its game players do not welcome, resulting in a reduction in the active accounts or active paying accounts of its online games. Changyous failure to address the above-mentioned issues could adversely affect the game-playing experience of its game players, damage the reputation of its games, shorten the lifespans of its games, and result in the loss of game players and a decrease in its revenues. Changyou generates all of its game revenues under the item-based revenue model, which presents risks related to consumer preferences and regulatory restrictions. All of Changyous games, including PC games, mobile games and Web games, are operated under the item-based revenue model. Under this revenue model, Changyous game players are able to play the games for free if they so choose, but are charged for the purchase of virtual items in the games. Changyou currently expects that all of its game revenues, including revenues from any future games, will continue to be generated under the item-based revenue model. The item-based revenue model requires Changyou to design games that not only attract game players to spend more time playing, but also encourage them to purchase virtual items. The sale of virtual items requires Changyou to track closely consumer tastes and preferences, especially as to in-game consumption patterns. If Changyou fails to design and price virtual items so as to incentivize game players to purchase them, Changyou may not be able to effectively translate its game player base and their playing time into revenues. In addition, the item-based revenue model may cause additional concerns with PRC regulators who have been implementing regulations designed to reduce the amount of time that Chinese youths spend on online games and intended to limit the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators and the amount purchased by individual game players. A revenue model that does not charge for time played may be viewed by the PRC regulators as inconsistent with these goals. The item-based revenue model may not continue to be commercially successful and in the future Changyou may need to change its revenue model to a time-based or other revenue model. Any change in revenue model could result in disruption of Changyous game operations, a decrease in the number of its game players and a decline in its revenues. Undetected programming errors or defects in Changyous games could harm its reputation and adversely affect its results of operations. Changyous games are subject to frequent improvement and updates, and may contain bugs or flaws that may become apparent only after the updated applications are accessed by users, particularly as Changyou launches new updates under tight time constraints. From time to time, Changyous users may inform it of programming bugs affecting their experience, and Changyou is generally able to resolve such flaws promptly. However, if for any reason programming bugs or flaws are not resolved in a timely fashion, Changyou may lose some of its users and its revenues will be affected negatively, and its reputation and the market acceptance of its games may also be harmed. 79 Table of Contents Changyou may fail to launch new games according to its timetable, and its new games may not be commercially successful. All online games have limited lifespans. Changyou must launch new games that can generate additional revenue and diversify its revenue sources in order to remain competitive. Changyou will not generate any meaningful revenue from a game in development until it is commercially launched after open beta testing, and we cannot assure you that Changyou will be able to meet its timetable for new game launches or that its new games will be successful. A number of factors, including technical difficulties, lack of sufficient game development personnel and other resources, failure to obtain or delays in obtaining relevant governmental authorities approvals and adverse developments in Changyous relationships with the licensors or third-party operators of its new games could result in delayed launching of its new games. In addition, we cannot assure you that Changyous new games will be as well received in the market as TLBB and TLBB 3D have been, and you should not view Changyous historical game revenues or the success of TLBB and TLBB 3D as indications of the commercial success of any of its new or future games. Changyou may fail to anticipate and adapt to future technical trends, new business models and changed game player preferences and requirements, fail to effectively plan and organize marketing and promotion activities, or fail to differentiate its new games from its existing games. If the new games Changyou introduces are not commercially successful, Changyou may not be able to generate sufficient revenues from new games to sustain or grow its revenues or to recover its product development costs and sales and marketing expenses, which can be significant. Rapid technological changes may increase Changyous game development costs. Technological development in online game industry is evolving rapidly, so Changyou needs to anticipate new technologies and evaluate their possible market acceptance. For example, the use of virtual reality technology has improved, and can be expected to continue to improve, game players in-game experience and level of participation. In addition, government authorities or industry organizations may adopt new standards that apply to game development. Any new technologies and new standards may require increases in expenditures for PC game and mobile game development and operations, and Changyou will need to adapt its business to cope with the changes and support these new services to be successful. If Changyou falls behind in adopting new technologies or standards, its existing games may lose popularity, and its newly developed games may not be well received in the marketplace. The proliferation of cheating programs and scam offers that seek to exploit Changyous games and players harms the game-playing experience and may lead players to stop playing its games. Third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, cheating programs that enable players to exploit Changyous games, play the games in an automated way or obtain unfair advantages over other players who play fairly. These programs harm the experience of players who play fairly and may disrupt the economics of Changyous games. In addition, unrelated third parties may attempt to scam Changyous players with fake offers for virtual items. Changyou needs to devote significant resources to discover, disable and prevent such programs and activities, and if Changyou is unable to do so quickly its operations may be disrupted, its reputation may be damaged and players may stop playing its games. This may lead to lost revenue and increased costs for Changyou to develop technological measures to combat such programs and activities. Changyous business may be harmed if its games are not featured in a sufficient number of Internet cafés in China A certain number of game players access Changyous games through Internet cafés in China. Due to limited hardware capacity, Internet cafés generally feature a limited number of games on their computers. Changyou thus competes with a growing number of other online game operators to ensure that its games are featured on these computers. It is necessary for Changyou to maintain good relationships with Internet café operators, to ensure that its games are featured in a sufficient number of Internet cafés. If Changyou fails to maintain good relationships with Internet café operators, or if Changyou and /or its third-party operators fail to successfully persuade Internet cafés to feature its games, its revenues may be affected. Game players spending on Changyous games may be adversely affected by slower growth in the Chinese economy and adverse conditions in the global economy. Changyou relies on the spending of its game players for its revenues, which in turn depends on the players level of disposable income, perceived future earnings capabilities and willingness to spend. The real estate market in the PRC and the level of exports from the PRC have both experienced significant declines recently and, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the growth rate of Chinas gross domestic product, compared to that of the previous year, slowed from 9.2% in 2011 to 7.5% in 2012 and 7.7% in 2013 and 7.4% in 2014 and 6.9% in 2015. Such growth may also slow in the future, which could in turn result in a reduction in spending by Changyous game players. 80 Table of Contents In addition, the global economy has experienced significant instability and there has been volatility in global financial and credit markets in recent years, recent growth in the United States economy may not be sustainable and some analysts are concerned that the European Community may experience a sustained downturn. It is unclear how long such instability and volatility will continue, whether it will increase, whether it will lead to a renewed worldwide economic downturn such as the one that began in 2008, and how much adverse impact such instability and volatility or any such downturn might have on the economies of China and other jurisdictions where Changyou operates its games. Any such instability, volatility or adverse impact in China or in overseas markets could cause Changyous game players to reduce their spending on its games in China or overseas and reduce its revenues. Risks Related to the Platform Channel Business Changyou has not been able to successfully monetize its platform channel business beyond the operation of its 17173.com Website or to recoup its significant investment in such business. During 2013 and 2014 Changyou made significant investments in acquiring assets and marketing, including both domestic and overseas marketing, and spent considerable sums to increase its staffing levels, with the goal of expanding and promoting its platform channel business beyond the operation of the 17173.com Website. However, Changyou has not generated meaningful revenues from such additions to its platform channel business. Changyous continuing efforts to monetize those products and services have not been successful, and we believe that it is unlikely Changyou will be able to make its platform channel business apart from the 17173.com Website profitable or that Changyou will be able to recoup the investments it made in assets, marketing and staffing for the platform channel business. For example, after Changyous acquisition of a majority interest in MoboTap, Changyous management concluded that the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap would not be able to provide expected synergies with Changyous platform channel business, and Changyou recognized substantial impairment charges as a result. Also see Changyous previous and any future acquisitions and/or strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on its ability to manage its business and may also result in impairment charges. Online advertising revenues from the 17173.com Website could fail to grow or could decline as a result of uncertainties in the game market and the online advertising market. Changyous online advertising revenues of $57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which were mainly derived from the operation of the 17173.com Website, represented 7.6% of Changyous total revenues for the year. Changyous ability to maintain or grow online advertising revenues may be adversely affected by any of the following risk factors:  Changes in government policy could restrict or curtail Changyous online advertising services;  The decline in the demand for online advertising services from developers and operators of PC games, as the relative popularity of such games continues to decline;  Advertising clients may adopt new methods and strategies other than online advertising to promote their brands, which would have an adverse impact on Changyous advertising revenues; and  The acceptance of the Internet as a medium for advertising depends on the development of a measurement standard. No standards for the measurement of the effectiveness of online advertising have been widely accepted. Industry-wide standards may not develop sufficiently to support the Internet as an effective advertising medium. If these standards do not develop, advertisers may choose not to advertise on the Internet in general, or through Changyous Websites. In addition, Changyous ability to generate and maintain significant online advertising revenues will also depend upon:  the development of a large base of users possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertising clients;  the development of successful mobile versions of the 17173.com Website and the provision of extensive mobile game-related products and services in response to the rapid migration of users of Internet services from PCs to mobile devices, such as tablets and mobile phones;  the acceptance of online advertisements, either through PCs or mobile devices, as an effective method of business marketing;  the effectiveness of Changyous advertising delivery, tracking and reporting systems;  the extent of resistance from existing or potential customers to online advertising prices; and  the development of new formats for online advertising, such as streaming video. 81 Table of Contents The expansion of Internet advertisement blocking software may result in a decrease in advertising revenues. The development of Web software that blocks Internet advertisements before they appear on a users screen may hinder the growth of online advertising. The expansion of advertisement blocking on the Internet may decrease Changyous revenues from the 17173.com Website because, when an advertisement is blocked, it is not downloaded from the server, which means that it will not be tracked as a delivered advertisement. In addition, advertisers may choose not to advertise on the Internet or on the 17173.com Website because of the use by third parties of Internet advertisement blocking software. Changyou relies on advertising agencies to sell online advertising services on the 17173.com Website. If current trends of consolidation of advertising agencies in the Chinese market continue, the bargaining power of the large advertising agencies resulting from such consolidation may permit them to require that Changyou pay higher sales rebates, which would adversely affect Changyous gross margin. Most of the online advertising services of the 17173.com Website are distributed by, and most of the online advertising revenues of the 17173.com Website are derived from, advertising agencies. For example, in 2015 Changyou engaged four advertising agencies, which contributed approximately 95% of the online advertising revenues of the 17173.com Website. In consideration for these agencies services, Changyou is required to pay certain percentages of revenues as sales rebates. If the online advertising market is consolidated and effectively controlled by a small number of large advertising agencies, such advertising agencies may be in a position to demand higher sales rebates based on increased bargaining power, which could negatively affect Changyous online advertising growth, as Changyou books its online advertising revenue net of its sales rebates to advertising agencies. Risks of Others Business Changyou may not be able to maintain or expand the revenues that it receives from cinema advertising services. Changyous cinema advertising business generates revenues through contracts that Changyou enters into with advertisers to place their advertisements in pre-film advertising slots in movie theaters. Changyou acquires the cinema advertising rights for such pre-film advertising slots under long-term contracts, typically with threeyear terms, with various theaters. If Changyou is unable to sell to advertisers all of the pre-film advertising slots that Changyou purchases, it may not be able to recoup its upfront payments and committed payments under the contracts. Further, we cannot assure you that Changyou will be able to develop, maintain or expand the types of cooperative relationships with movie theaters that will permit Changyou to maintain its existing rights or to obtain any additional rights to pre-movie advertisement slots at reasonable prices. Any failure by Changyou to develop, maintain or expand such cooperative relationships could prevent it from increasing its cinema advertising revenues, could cause such revenues to decrease or could result in Changyous cinema advertising business generating losses. General Business Risks Changyous prospects for growth may be adversely affected if it cannot successfully manage and make timely adjustments to its hiring needs to support its business strategies. The Internet industry in China is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, particularly for game developers and related technical personnel, and Changyous success in the implementation of its growth strategies depends on its ability to successfully manage, and make timely adjustments to, its hiring needs. The number of Changyous employees increased 35.3% between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013 as it expanded its business into mobile games, the platform channel business and international markets, but decreased 11.0% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 and decreased 41.9% between the end of 2014 and the end of 2015, as Changyou emphasized the development of mobile games and laid off a number of employees who had been focused primarily on international markets and the platform channel business other than the 17173.com Website. These layoffs could have an adverse effect on Changyous remaining employees morale and their loyalty to Changyou, and cause it to lose employees whose talents and experience are important for its business, and could also have a negative impact on its reputation as an employer and its ability to attract qualified employees in the future. Laid-off employees could also make claims against Changyou for additional compensation, causing it to incur additional expense. 82 Table of Contents Changyou may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to it, could subject it to significant liabilities and other costs. Changyous success depends largely on its ability to use and develop its technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert intellectual property claims against Changyou. Changyou is subject to additional risks if entities licensing to it intellectual property, including, for example, game source codes, do not have adequate rights in any such licensed materials. The validity and scope of claims relating to the intellectual property of game development and technology involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analyses and, therefore, tend to be uncertain. If third parties assert copyright or patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights against Changyou, it will have to defend itself in litigation or administrative proceedings, which can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of its technical and management personnel. An adverse determination or settlement in any such litigation or proceedings to which Changyou may become a party could subject it to significant liability to third parties, or require it to seek licenses from third parties, pay ongoing royalties, or redesign its games or subject it to injunctions prohibiting the development and operation of its games. Changyou may need to incur significant expenses to enforce its proprietary rights, and if it is unable to protect such rights, its competitive position and financial performance could be harmed. Changyou regards its intellectual property and proprietary rights as critical to its success. In particular, Changyou has spent a significant amount of time and resources in developing its current games and possible future games. Changyous ability to protect its proprietary rights in connection with its games is critical for their success and Changyous overall financial performance. While Changyou has registered software in China for copyright protection and have taken various measures to protect its source codes, such measures may not be sufficient to protect its proprietary information and intellectual property. Intellectual property rights and confidentiality protection in China may not be as effective as they are in the United States and other developed countries. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. In addition, while Changyou has registered some trademarks relating to its games in the PRC and other jurisdictions, and has applied for additional registrations of trademarks, in some instances Changyou may not succeed in obtaining registration of trademarks that Changyou has applied for in different languages, such as English. There is no assurance that these pending or future trademark applications will be approved. Any failure to register trademarks in any country or region may limit Changyous ability to protect its rights in such country or region under relevant trademark laws, and Changyou may need to change the name of the relevant trademark in certain cases, which may adversely affect its branding and marketing efforts. Despite Changyous efforts to protect its intellectual property, online game developers may copy its ideas and designs, and other third parties may infringe its intellectual property rights. For example, certain third parties have misappropriated the source codes of previous versions of TLBB and have set up unauthorized servers in China and elsewhere to operate TLBB to compete with Changyou. Although in response Changyou has taken measures to enforce its intellectual property rights, such measures may not be successful in eliminating these unauthorized servers. The existence of unauthorized servers may attract game players away from Changyous games and may result in decreases in its revenues. Litigation relating to intellectual property rights may result in substantial costs to Changyou and diversion of resources and management attention away from its business, and may not be successful. In addition, Changyous ideas and certain of its designs, if not fixed in a tangible form of expression or registered with the appropriate PRC authorities, may not be protected by patents or other intellectual property rights. As a result, Changyou may be limited in its ability to assert intellectual property rights against online game developers who independently develop ideas and designs that compete with it. Changyou may not have exclusive rights to trademarks, designs and technologies that are crucial to its business. Changyou has applied for initial registrations in the PRC and overseas, and/or changes in registrations relating to transfers of its key trademarks in the PRC, including ChangYou.com, cyou.com, TLBB, TL logos, New Blade Online, 17173, TLBB 3D and the corresponding Chinese versions of the marks, so as to establish and protect its exclusive rights to these trademarks. Changyou has succeeded in registering the trademarks ChangYou.com, cyou.com, TLBB, TL logos, 17173 and Dolphin Browser in the PRC under certain classes. The applications for initial registration, and/or changes in registrations relating to transfers, of other marks and/or of some of these marks under other classes are still under examination by the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry & Commerce of the PRC, or the SAIC, and relevant authorities overseas. Changyou has applied for patents relating to the design of its games and to technology intended to enhance the functionalities of its games. Changyou has various patent applications under examination by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC. Approvals of its initial trademark registration applications, and/or of changes in registrations relating to such transfers, or of its patent applications, are subject to determinations by the Trademark Office of the SAIC, the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC and relevant authorities overseas that there are no prior rights in the applicable territory. There is no assurance that these applications will be approved. Any rejection of these applications could adversely affect Changyous rights to the affected marks, designs and technologies. In addition, even if these applications are approved, there is no assurance that any registered trademark or issued patent will be sufficient in scope to provide adequate protection of Changyous rights. 83 Table of Contents Breaches in the security of Changyous server network could cause disruptions in its service, facilitate piracy of its intellectual property, or compromise confidential information of its game players. Changyou stores on its servers and transmits over the Internet considerable and continually increasing amounts of data, much of which is essential to the operation of its business or is highly confidential information concerning its business and its game players. In addition, the expansion of Changyous business to include mobile games and its need to comply with PRC regulations requiring real-name registration of Changyous game players are likely to cause the amount of personal data concerning its game players that is transmitted over its networks to increase over time. Any breaches of Changyous network by hackers could cause severe disruptions in its service, allow piracy of the source code used in the operation of its games and allow pirated versions of its games to enter the marketplace, or result in the release of confidential personal or financial information of its game players, any of which could have an adverse impact on its business, its revenues, and its reputation among game players. In order to minimize the likelihood of such breaches as Changyous business expands and the amount of confidential and sensitive data increases, Changyou expects that it will need to expend considerable resources to maintain and enhance the effectiveness of its security systems. The successful operation of Changyous business and implementation of its growth strategies, including its ability to accommodate additional game players and advertising clients in the future, depend upon the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure and fixed telecommunications networks in China. Almost all access to the Internet in China is maintained through state-owned telecommunications operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or MIIT. Changyou relies on this infrastructure to provide data communications capacity, primarily through local telecommunications lines. Although the PRC government has announced plans to develop the national information infrastructure, this infrastructure may not be developed as planned or at all. In addition, Changyou will have no access to alternative networks and services, on a timely basis if at all, in the event of any infrastructure disruption or failure. The Internet infrastructure in China may not support the demands necessary for continued growth in Internet usage. Changyou may be subject to, and may expend significant resources in defending against, claims regarding the content and services Changyou provides over its Websites. As Changyous services may be used to download and distribute information to others, there is a risk that claims may be made against it for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or based on the nature and content of such information. Furthermore, Changyou could be subject to claims related to the online activities of its visitors and incur significant costs in its defense. In the past, claims regarding the nature and content of information that was posted online by visitors have been made in the United States against companies that provide online services. Changyou could be exposed to liability for the selection of listings that may be accessible through its Websites or through content and materials that its visitors may post in classifieds, message boards, chat rooms or other interactive services. If any information provided through Changyous services contains errors, third parties may make claims against it for losses incurred in reliance on the information. Changyou does not carry any liability insurance against of the foregoing risks. Changyou does not have business insurance coverage. The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products, or offer them at a high price. As a result, Changyou does not have any business liability, loss of data or disruption insurance coverage for its operations in China or the operations of its joint operators in China and overseas. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in Changyous incurring substantial costs and the diversion of its resources. The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of Internet access in relation to per capita gross domestic product may limit the development of the Internet in China and impede Changyous growth. The penetration rate for personal computers in China is significantly lower than it is in the United States and other developed countries. Furthermore, the cost of Internet access in China is still relatively high as compared to other developed countries. The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of Internet access may limit the growth of Changyous business. In addition, there may be increases in Internet access fees or telecommunication fees in China. If that happens, the number of Changyous game players may decrease or the growth of its game player base may be adversely impacted. Slow growth of, or a decrease in, the traffic on the 17173.com Website may also cause Changyous advertising clients to reduce their use of its online advertising services, reducing its online advertising revenues. 84 Table of Contents Changyou faces risks related to health epidemics and other natural disasters. Changyous business could be adversely affected by the effects of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, avian influenza or other epidemics or outbreaks. In recent years, there have been reports of occurrences of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza and of avian influenza in various parts of China, including a few confirmed human cases and deaths. Any prolonged recurrence of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, avian influenza or other adverse public health developments in China may have an adverse effect on Changyous business operations. Adverse effects could include illness and loss of Changyous management and key employees, as well as temporary closure of its offices and related other businesses, such as server operations, upon which Changyou relies, and a decrease in the number of its game players. Such loss of management and key employees or closures would severely disrupt Changyous business operations. Changyou has not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, avian influenza, or any other epidemics. In addition, other major natural disasters may also adversely affect Changyous business by, for example, causing disruptions of the Internet network or otherwise affecting access to its games. Changyou may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow in U.S. dollars in the future to service its debt obligations, which would cause it to default under its U.S. dollar bank loan facilities. Changyous ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance its obligations with respect to, its indebtedness to banks for borrowed money will depend on its financial and operating performance, which in turn will be affected by general economic conditions and by financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. It is possible that Changyou will be unable in the future to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to cover indebtedness under its existing or future bank loan facilities. Further, most of Changyous business operations are conducted in Mainland China and most of its revenues are denominated in RMB, while its existing loans were primarily advanced to it offshore in U.S. dollars, and are repayable in U.S. dollars. The conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars generally must be made via Changyous onshore subsidiaries payment of dividends to its offshore subsidiaries, which can be time-consuming, due to Chinas strict foreign exchange controls, which could potentially prevent Changyou from making timely repayment of its offshore loans and cause a default under the loans. Risks Related to Changyous Corporate Structure and PRC Law and Regulations Changyou operates some of its existing games, and plans to operate certain of its future games, with Internet authorization codes that Changyou obtained through third-party electronic publishing entities. If the SAPPRFT challenges the commercial operation of any of Changyous games that are operated with Internet authorization codes obtained through third-party publishing entities, Changyou may be subject to various penalties, including restrictions on its operations. Under regulations issued by the SAPPRFT and the MIIT, online game operators are required to have an Internet publishing license, and an authorization code obtained under such a license is required for each game in operation and publicly available in the PRC. Changyou publishes certain of its existing games with authorization codes obtained under Internet publishing licenses held by third parties. For example, Wuhan Baina Information publishes a mobile online game with authorization codes obtained through a third-party. Current PRC regulations are not clear as to the consequence of obtaining authorization codes through the licenses of third-party entities. Changyous past and expected future practices might be challenged by the SAPPRFT, which could subject Changyou to various penalties, including fines, confiscation of publishing equipment and the revenues generated from the publishing activities, the revocation of its business license, or the forced discontinuation of or restrictions on its operations. If Changyou is found to be in violation of current or future PRC law and regulations regarding Internet-related services and telecom-related activities, it could be subject to severe penalties. The PRC government has enacted regulations that apply to Internet-related services and telecom-related activities, and purport to limit and require licensing of various aspects of the provision of Internet information and content, online games, and online advertising services. Under regulations issued by the MOC, commercial entities are required to apply to a local branch of the MOC for an Online Culture Operating Permit if they engage in the production, duplication, importation, release or broadcasting of Internet cultural products; the dissemination of online cultural products on the Internet or the transmission of such products via Internet or mobile phone networks to user terminals, such as computers, phones, television sets and gaming consoles; the provision of Internet surfing service sites such as Internet cafés; or the holding or exhibition of contests related to Internet cultural products. Many aspects of the existing regulations remain unclear. In addition, the PRC government may promulgate new laws or regulations at any time. If current or future laws or regulations regarding Internet-related activities are interpreted to be inconsistent with Changyous ownership structure and/or its business operations, its business could be severely impaired and it could be subject to severe penalties. 85 Table of Contents Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the Internet in China may adversely affect Changyous business, and it may be liable for information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to its Websites. The PRC government has adopted regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news and other information over the Internet. Under these regulations, Internet content providers and Internet publishers are prohibited from posting or displaying over the Internet any content that, among other things, violates PRC law and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China, or is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory. When Internet content providers and Internet publishers, including online game operators, find that information falling within the above scope is transmitted on their Websites or is stored in their electronic bulletin service systems, they are required to terminate the transmission of such information or delete such information immediately, keep records, and report to relevant authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the revocation of Changyous ICP license and other required licenses and the closure of its Websites. Internet content providers may also be held liable for prohibited information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to their Websites. In addition, the MIIT has published regulations that subject Internet content providers to potential liability for the actions of game players and others using their Websites, including liability for violations of PRC law prohibiting the dissemination of content deemed to be socially destabilizing. As these regulations are subject to interpretation by the relevant authorities, it is not possible for us to determine in all cases the type of content that could result in liability for Changyou as a developer and operator of online games, and as an operator of the 17173.com Website and the Dolphin Browser. In addition, Changyou may not be able to control or restrict the content of other Internet content providers linked to or accessible through its Websites, or content generated or placed on its Websites by its game players, despite its attempt to monitor such content. To the extent that regulatory authorities find any portion of Changyous content objectionable, they may require Changyou to curtail its games, which may reduce its game player base, the amount of time its games are played or the purchases of virtual items. Changyou may be subject to the PRC governments ongoing crackdown on Internet pornographic content. The PRC government has stringent restrictions on online pornographic information and has launched several crackdowns on Internet pornography. Regulations jointly issued by the MIIT and three other government authorities jointly provide for rewards of up to RMB10,000 to Internet users who report Websites that feature pornography, and the MIIT established a committee to review such reports to determine an appropriate award. Changyou has not, to date, received any penalty from the PRC government in this regard. However, it is possible that content considered pornographic or vulgar by PRC government agencies will appear in the future on Websites or games that Changyou operates. In the event that Changyou is accused by the PRC government of hosting pornographic or vulgar content, its business and reputation could be adversely affected. There are currently no laws or regulations in the PRC governing property rights of virtual assets and therefore it is not clear what liabilities, if any, Changyou may have relating to the loss of virtual assets by its game players. In the course of playing Changyous games, game players can acquire and accumulate virtual assets, such as game player experience, skills and weaponry. Such virtual assets can be highly valued by game players and in some cases are traded among game players for real money or assets. In practice, virtual assets can be lost for various reasons, such as data loss caused by delay of network service by a network crash, or by hacking activities. There are currently no PRC law and regulations governing property rights of virtual assets. As a result, it is unclear who the legal owner of virtual assets is and whether the ownership of virtual assets is protected by law. In addition, it is unclear under PRC law and regulations whether an operator of online games such as Changyou would have any liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for loss of such virtual assets by game players. Based on several judgments regarding the liabilities of online game operators for loss of virtual assets by game players, the courts have generally required the online game operators to provide well-developed security systems to protect such virtual assets owned by game players. In the event of a loss of virtual assets, Changyou may be sued by game players and may be held liable for damages. Changyous online game operations may be adversely affected by implementation of anti-fatigue-related regulations. The PRC government may decide to adopt more stringent policies to monitor the online game industry as a result of adverse public reaction to perceived addiction to online games, particularly by minors. Eight PRC government authorities, including the SAPPRFT, the Ministry of Education and the MIIT, jointly issued regulations, or the Anti-Fatigue Notice, requiring all Chinese online game operators to adopt an anti-fatigue system in an effort to curb addiction to online games by minors. Under the anti-fatigue system, three hours or less of continuous play is defined to be healthy, three to five hours is defined to be fatiguing, and five hours or more is defined to be unhealthy. Game operators are required to reduce the value of game benefits for minor game players by half when those game players reach the fatiguing level, and to zero when they reach the unhealthy level. In addition, online game players in China are now required to register their identity card numbers before they can play an online game. This system allows game operators to identify which game players are minors. These restrictions could limit Changyous ability to increase its business among minors. If these restrictions were expanded to apply to adult game players in the future, Changyous revenues could be adversely affected. 86 Table of Contents These eight PRC government authorities subsequently promulgated additional regulations, including a Notice on Initializing the verification of Real-name Registration for Anti-Fatigue System on Internet Games, or the Real-name Registration Notice, to strengthen the implementation of the anti-fatigue system and real-name registration. The Real-name Registration Notices main focus is to prevent minors from using an adults identity to play Internet games and, accordingly, provides stringent punishment for online game operators for not implementing the anti-fatigue and real name registration measures properly and effectively. The most severe punishment contemplated by the Real-name Registration Notice is termination of the operation of the online game if it is found to be in violation of the Anti-Fatigue Notice, the Real-name Registration Notice or the circular entitled Implementation of Online Game Monitor System of the Guardians of Minors, or the Monitor System Circular. The Real-name Registration Notice increases Changyous operating risks, as it will be required to spend more resources on the real-name verification and anti-fatigue system, which will lead to an increase in its operating costs. In addition, the amount of time that minors will be able to spend playing online games such as Changyous will be further limited, which can be expected to lead to a reduction in Changyous revenues. Furthermore, if Changyou is found to be violating these regulations, it may be required to suspend or discontinue its online game operations. In February 2013, 15 PRC government authorities, including the SAPPRFT, the Ministry of Education, the MOC and the MIIT, jointly issued the Work Plan for the Integrated Prevention of Minors Online Game Addiction, or the Work Plan, implementing integrated measures by different authorities to prevent minors from being addicted to online games. Under the Work Plan, the current relevant regulations will be further clarified and additional implementation rules will be issued by relevant authorities. As a result, Changyou may have to impose more stringent limits for minor game players, which may lead to an increase in its operating expenses and a reduction in its revenues from minor game players. In July 2014, the SAPPRFT issued the Notice on Further Launch Verification of Real-name Registration for Anti-Fatigue System on Internet Games, stating that, in view of some of the hardware and functionality limitations inherent in mobile devices, anti-fatigue system requirements applicable to Internet games do not currently apply to mobile games. If the SAPPRFT in the future decides to expand the anti-fatigue system requirements to mobile games, Changyous operating expenses would be likely to increase. Restrictions on virtual currency may adversely affect Changyous online game revenues. Changyous online game revenues are collected through the online sale of game points and sale of its prepaid cards. The Notice on the Reinforcement of the Administration of Internet Cafés and Online Games, or the Internet Cafés Notice, issued by the MOC in 2007, directs the Peoples Bank of China, or the PBOC, to strengthen the administration of virtual currency in online games to avoid any adverse impact on the PRC economy and financial system. The Internet Cafés Notice places strict limits on the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators in the PRC and the amount purchased by individual users in the PRC, and requires a clear division between virtual transactions and real transactions carried out by way of electronic commerce. The Internet Cafés Notice also provides that virtual currency should only be used to purchase virtual items. In 2009, the MOC and the MOFCOM jointly issued the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Online Game Virtual Currency, or the Virtual Currency Notice. In the Virtual Currency Notice, the MOC and the MOFCOM for the first time defined virtual currency as a type of virtual exchange instrument issued by online game operators, purchased directly or indirectly by the game user by exchanging legal currency at a certain exchange rate, saved outside the game programs, stored in servers provided by online game operators in electronic record format and represented by specific numeric units. In addition, the Virtual Currency Notice categorizes companies involved with virtual currency in the PRC as either issuers or trading platforms and prohibits companies from simultaneously operating both as issuers and as trading platforms. One of the Virtual Currency Notices stated intended objectives is to limit the circulation of virtual currency and thereby reduce concerns that it may impact real world inflation. Specifically, the Virtual Currency Notice requires online game operators to report the total amount of their issued virtual currency on a quarterly basis, and game operators are prohibited from issuing disproportionate amounts of virtual currency in order to generate revenues. In addition, the Virtual Currency Notice reiterates that virtual currency can only be provided to users in exchange for an RMB payment and can only be used to pay for virtual goods and services of the issuers. Online game operators are prohibited from providing lucky draws or lotteries which are conducted on the condition that participants contribute cash or virtual currencies in exchange for game props or virtual currencies, and from providing virtual currency trading services to minors. The Virtual Currency Notice places additional potentially burdensome obligations on online game operators, including a requirement that operators keep transaction data records for no less than 180 days, which means that Changyou must design and operate its databases so that it can maintain users information for the minimum required period, resulting in higher costs for its online game operations. Changyou must tailor its business model carefully in order to comply with the overall requirements of the Virtual Currency Notice, in a manner which can be expected to result in relatively lower sales of Changyous game coins and an adverse impact on its online game revenues. 87 Table of Contents Changyous business may be adversely affected by public opinion and governmental policies in China as well as in other jurisdictions where Changyou operates its online games or licenses its online games to third parties. Currently, most of Changyous game players in China are young males, many of whom are students. Due to relatively easy access to personal computers and Internet cafés, the increasing use and popularity of mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets connected to the Internet, and the lack of other appealing forms of entertainment in China, many teenagers in China frequently play online games. This may result in these teenagers spending less time on or refraining from other activities, including education, vocational training, sports, and resting, which could result in adverse public reaction and stricter government regulation. For example, the PRC government has promulgated anti-fatigue-related regulations to limit the amount of time minors can play online games. Adverse public opinion could discourage game players from playing Changyous games, and could result in government regulations that impose additional limitations on the operations of online games as well as game players access to online games. For example, under the Monitor System Circular online game operators are required to adopt various measures to maintain a system to communicate with the parents of minors playing online games and are required to monitor the activities of minors and suspend the accounts of minors if so requested by their parents. We believe that stricter government regulations, such as regulations imposing stricter age and hour limits, limiting the issuance of virtual currency by online game operators or the amount of virtual currency that can be purchased by an individual game player, and extending anti-fatigue-related regulations to adults, could be implemented in the future. Any such adverse public opinion or tightened government regulations could adversely affect Changyous ability to maintain or increase its revenues. In addition, the PRC State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, has announced that it will tax game players on the income derived from the trading of virtual currencies at the rate of 20%. It is currently unclear how the tax will be collected or if there will be any effect on Changyous game players or its business, but collection of such a tax might discourage players who are interested in trading virtual currencies from playing Changyous games, which could reduce its revenues. Moreover, similar adverse public reaction may arise, and similar government policies may be adopted, in other jurisdictions where Changyou licenses or operates its games, which could similarly adversely affect its revenues. PRC law and regulations governing the online game industry in China are evolving and subject to future changes. Changyou may fail to obtain or maintain all applicable permits, approvals, registrations and filings. The online game industry in China is highly regulated by the PRC government. Various regulatory authorities of the PRC central government, such as the State Council, the MIIT, the SAPPRFT, the MOC and the Ministry of Public Security, are empowered to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of the online game industry. Changyou is required to obtain applicable permits, approvals and registrations from, or make necessary filings with, different regulatory authorities in order to operate its online games. For example, as an online game operator in China, Changyou must obtain an ICP license from the MIIT, an Online Cultural Operating Permit from the MOC and an Internet publishing license from the SAPPRFT in order to distribute games through the Internet. Any online game Changyou operates needs to be approved by the SAPPRFT prior to its launch and filed with the MOC within 30 days after its launch. Once a new online game or any upgrade, expansion pack or new version of any existing game is launched, such new game or such upgrade, expansion pack or new version of such existing game must be filed with the MOC and approval must be obtained from the SAPPRFT for online publication. If Changyou fails to maintain any of its permits, approvals or registrations, to make any necessary filings, or to apply for and obtain any new permits, approvals or registrations or make any new filings on a timely basis, Changyou may be subject to various penalties, including fines and a requirement that Changyou discontinue or limit its operations. 88 Table of Contents As the online game industry is at an early stage of development in China, new law and regulations may be adopted from time to time to require additional licenses and permits other than those Changyou currently has, and address new issues that arise. In addition, substantial uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of current and any future PRC law and regulations applicable to the online game industry. For example, there is ambiguity as to the division of authority and responsibilities between the SAPPRFT and the MOC with respect to regulating online games and, as a result, there may be overlapping approval requirements with respect to some aspects of Changyous games or Changyous game operations. On February 4, 2016, the SAPPRFT and the MIIT issued the Measures of Internet Publication Service Administration, or the New Internet Publication Measures, which will become effective on March 10, 2016. The New Internet Publication Measures strengthen the supervision of Internet publishing businesses and require that entities in the Internet publishing business apply for a new online publication license and obtain approval from the SAPPRFT prior to the publication of new online games. In addition, under the New Internet Publication Measures Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-invested entities are not permitted to engage in Internet publication services, and the legal representative of an entity providing Internet publication services may not be a foreigner. As the New Internet Publication Measures are new and have not yet become effective, the actual implications and reach of the New Internet Publication Measures are still uncertain. Furthermore, as mobile games are a new type of online game, there are uncertainties relating to whether a game developer, such as us, which provides mobile games to mobile device users, needs to obtain a separate operating license in addition to the ICP license that it has already obtained. For any mobile games Changyou launches, Changyou may be required to apply for a separate operating license for the mobile applications. Therefore, Changyou may not be able to obtain timely, or at all, required licenses or any other new license required in the future, and Changyou may be found to be in violation of current or future PRC law and regulations, which could impede its ability to conduct business. Further strengthened supervision of the online game industry may adversely affect Changyous online game operations. In September 2009, the SAPPRFT together with the National Copyright Administration, and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications jointly issued a Notice on Further Strengthening on the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Game and the Examination and Approval of Imported Online Game, or the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice. In the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice, the SAPPRFT states that it is the only governmental department with authority for examination and pre-approval of online games, and that all online game operators must obtain an Internet publishing license to provide online game services. Under the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice, additional approvals from the SAPPRFT are required when game operators release new versions or expansion packs, or make any changes to the originally approved online game. In addition, on July 1, 2009, the SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Strengthening the Approval and Administration of Imported Online Games, in which the SAPPRFT stated that it is the only governmental department authorized by the State Council to approve the importation of online games from offshore copyright owners. In the event of any failure to meet the above-mentioned requirements, an operator may face heavy penalties, such as being ordered to stop operation, or having its business license revoked. Changyous online game business may be adversely affected by these two SAPPRFT notices. The launch of expansion packs and imported games might be delayed because of the extra approval required. Such delay in releasing expansion packs or imported games may result in higher costs for Changyous online game operation and have an adverse effect on its game revenue. On June 3, 2010, the MOC issued the Interim Measures for Online Games Administration, or the Online Game Measures, which became effective on August 1, 2010, aiming to further strengthen the MOCs supervision of the online game industry. Specifically, the Online Game Measures reiterate that the MOC has the power to review the content of all online games except online game publications that have been pre-approved by the SAPPRFT. However, the Online Game Measures do not clearly specify what constitutes online game publication. Furthermore, the Online Game Measures provide that all domestic online games must be filed with the MOC, while all imported online games are subject to a content review prior to their launch. If a substantial change (for example, any significant modification to a games storyline, language, tasks, or trading system) is made to an existing imported or domestic online game, it will be subject to a new content review. Changyous online game business may be adversely affected by the Online Game Measures. The Online Game Measures do not set forth any specific procedure for the required filing and content review procedures for online games and therefore may cause delay when Changyou tries to file or apply for content review with the MOC. In addition, for Changyous imported licensed games, the requirement for prior approval of any substantial change may cause delay in releasing expansion packs, which may result in higher costs of its online game operation and have an adverse effect on its game revenue. In addition, the Online Game Measures do not resolve certain inconsistencies and ambiguities resulting from pronouncements included in previous notices issued by the SAPPRFT and the MOC. Because there is ambiguity in the scope of the authority and the roles and responsibilities of governmental departments, such as the SAPPRFT and the MOC, with oversight of the online game industry, Changyou may face stricter scrutiny of the day-to-day operations of its online game business. If any of its online game operating entities cannot comply with any of the stipulations of any PRC governmental department regarding the online game industry, Changyou may be subject to various penalties and its online game business may be adversely affected. 89 Table of Contents Heightened scrutiny of acquisition transactions by PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on Changyous business operations and its acquisition strategy. Pursuant to the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 698, effective on January 1, 2008, and the Announcement on Several Issues Related to Enterprise Income Tax for Indirect Asset Transfer by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises , or SAT Announcement 7, effective on February 3, 2015, issued by the SAT, if a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of or similar rights or interests in overseas companies which directly or indirectly own PRC taxable assets through an arrangement without a reasonable commercial purpose, but rather to avoid PRC corporate income tax, the transaction will be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets subject to PRC corporate income tax. SAT Announcement 7 specifies certain factors that should be considered in determining whether an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. However, as SAT Announcement 7 is newly issued, there is uncertainty as to the application of SAT Announcement 7 and the interpretation of the term reasonable commercial purpose. Under SAT Announcement 7, the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration for the transfer to the transferring shareholders has the obligation to withhold any PRC corporate income tax that is due. If the transferring shareholders do not pay corporate income tax that is due for a transfer and the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration does not withhold the tax due, the PRC tax authorities may impose a penalty on the entity that so fails to withhold, which may be relieved or exempted from the withholding obligation and any resulting penalty under certain circumstances if it reports such transfer to the PRC tax authorities. Although SAT Announcement 7 is generally effective as of February 3, 2015, it also applies to cases where the PRC tax treatment of a transaction that took place prior to its effectiveness has not yet been finally settled. As a result, SAT Announcement 7 could be determined by PRC tax authorities to be applicable to the historical reorganization of 7Road and Changyous acquisitions of the equity interests of 7Road and MoboTap, and it is possible that these transactions could be determined by PRC tax authorities to lack a reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, the transfer of 7Roads or MoboTaps shares to other parties could be subject to corporate income tax of up to 10% on capital gains generated from such transfers, and PRC tax authorities could impose tax obligations on the transferring shareholders or subject us to penalty if the transferring shareholders do not pay such obligations and Changyou does not withhold such tax. SAT Announcement 7 and its interpretation by relevant PRC authorities clarify that an exemption provided by SAT Circular 698 for transfers of shares in a publicly-traded entity that is listed overseas is available if the purchase of the shares and the sale of the shares both take place in open-market transactions. However, if a shareholder of an entity that is listed overseas purchases shares in the open market and sells them in a private transaction, or vice-versa, PRC tax authorities might deem such a transfer to be subject to SAT Circular 698 and SAT Announcement 7, which could subject such shareholder to additional reporting obligations or tax burdens. Accordingly, if a holder of Changyous ADSs or ordinary shares purchases its ADSs or ordinary shares in the open market and sells them in a private transaction, or vice-versa, and fails to comply with SAT Circular 698 or SAT Announcement 7, the PRC tax authorities may take actions, including requesting Changyou to provide assistance for their investigation or impose a penalty on it, which could have a negative impact on Changyous business operations. In addition, since Changyou may pursue acquisitions as one of its growth strategies, and may conduct acquisitions involving complex corporate structures, PRC tax authorities might impose taxes on capital gains or request that Changyou submit additional documentation for their review in connection with any potential acquisitions, which may cause it to incur additional acquisition costs or delay its acquisition timetable. As the special tax statuses of certain of Changyous PRC subsidiaries and VIEs as High and New Technology Enterprises,, software enterprises or Key National Software Enterprises expire, or if they are revoked, Changyou will have to pay additional taxes to make up any previously unpaid tax and will be subject to a higher tax rate. The CIT Law imposes a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. High and New Technology Enterprises (HNTEs) will enjoy a favorable tax rate of 15% for three years, but need to re-apply after the end of the three-year period. Key National Software Enterprises can enjoy a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10% for two years, but need to re-apply after the end of the two-year period. Certain of Changyous PRC Subsidiaries and VIEs qualified as HNTEs and enjoyed reduced tax rates in 2013, 2014 and/or 2015. In addition, one of its PRC subsidiaries qualified as a Key National Software Enterprise (KNSE) in 2013 and 2014. However, as a result of a restructuring of the approval process, the State Council recently suspended the acceptance of applications for KNSE status, and it is not clear when, if ever, the acceptance of applications for KNSE status will resume. In addition, the CIT Law and its implementing regulations provide that Software Enterprises can enjoy an income tax exemption for two years beginning with their first profitable year and a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years. A number of Changyous PRC Subsidiaries and VIEs qualified for exemptions or rate reductions in 2013, 2014 and/or 2015. 90 Table of Contents There are uncertainties regarding future interpretation and implementation of the CIT Law and its implementing regulations. It is possible that the HNTE, Software Enterprise, and KNSE qualifications of Changyous operating entities currently qualified as such, or their entitlement to an income tax exemption or refund of their VAT, will be challenged by higher level tax authorities and be repealed, or that there will be future implementing regulations that are inconsistent with current interpretation of the CIT Law. Therefore, it is possible that the qualifications of one or more of Changyous PRC Subsidiaries or VIEs will be challenged in the future or that such companies will not be able to take any further actions, such as re-application for qualification, to enjoy such preferential tax treatments. If those operating entities cannot qualify for such income tax or VAT reductions, Changyous effective income tax rate or VAT rate, as the case may be, will be increased significantly and Changyou may have to pay additional income tax to make up the previously unpaid tax, which would reduce its net income. To fund any cash requirements Changyou may have, Changyou may need to rely on dividends, loans or advances made by its principal PRC subsidiaries AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology, which are subject to limitations and possible taxation under applicable PRC law. Changyou may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity, or loans and advances made by its PRC subsidiaries AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology to fund any cash requirements Changyou may have, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions, if any, to its shareholders or ADS holders, and to service any debt Changyou may incur. The distribution of dividends and the making of loans and advances by entities organized in China are subject to limitations. Regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology are also required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to their general reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of the entities registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends, loans or advances. AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology may also allocate a portion of their after-tax profits, as determined by their boards of directors, to their staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to Changyou. In addition, if AmazGame, Gamespace or Beijing Baina Technology incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to Changyou. Furthermore, under regulations of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, the RMB is not convertible into foreign currencies for capital account items, such as loans, repatriation of investments and investments outside of China, unless prior approval of the SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made, which could delay or prevent any transfers of funds from Changyous PRC subsidiaries to Changyou. In addition, there are uncertainties under the CIT Law with regard to the PRC withholding tax on dividends paid by AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology to Changyous Hong Kong subsidiaries. Should such dividends be subject to PRC withholding tax or be subject to the usual CIT Law withholding tax rate of 10% rather than the preferential dividend withholding tax rate of 5% provided under the China-HK Tax Arrangement, the amount of cash available to Changyou for Changyous cash needs, including for the payment of dividends to its shareholders or ADS holders, would be reduced. Furthermore, Changyou controls its principal VIEs Gamease, Guanyou Gamespace and Wuhan Baina Information through contractual arrangements rather than equity ownership. To the extent that there is any distributable profit in Gamease, Guanyou Gamespace or Wuhan Baina Information, it may be difficult for these entities to distribute such profit to AmazGame, Gamespace or Beijing Baina Technology, which may further limit the amount that these PRC subsidiaries can distribute to Changyou. Risks Related to Changyous Shares Changyous operating results for a particular period could fall below its expectations or the expectations of investors or research analysts, resulting in a decrease in the price of its ADSs and the value of our interest in Changyou. Changyous operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of factors beyond its control, such as the slowdown in Chinas economic growth that occurred between the first quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2012 and during 2014, caused in part by measures adopted by the Chinese government intended to slow such growth and to temper real estate prices and inflation, and the significant instability recently experienced in the worldwide economy, and the European Community facing disruptions as a result of crises in the economies of Greece and Spain, among other countries, and such factors may be difficult to predict for any given period. Other factors also could cause significant fluctuations in Changyous operating results, including the timing and success of its new game launches, its costs of developing and launching new games and software, and the level of user activity of its games and software in China during particular fiscal quarters. If its operating results for any period fall below its expectations or the expectations of investors or research analysts, the price of its ADSs is likely to decrease, which would reduce the value of our ownership interest in Changyou. 91 Table of Contents Changyou shareholders, including us, will experience dilution when additional Class A ordinary shares are issued in settlement of restricted share units or upon exercise of options. Changyou shareholders, including us, will experience dilution to the extent that additional Class A ordinary shares are issued upon settlement of restricted share units or exercise of outstanding options that Changyou may grant from time to time. As of the date of this report, there were outstanding 44,986 Class A restricted share units, with each such restricted share unit settleable upon vesting by the issuance of Changyou one Class A ordinary share, and outstanding options for the purchase of 3,270,000 Changyou Class A ordinary shares at a nominal price. Changyou may need additional capital and may sell additional ADSs or other equity securities or incur indebtedness, which could result in additional dilution to its shareholders, including us, or increase its debt service obligations. Changyou may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions Changyou may decide to pursue. If its cash resources are insufficient to satisfy its cash requirements, Changyou may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities or equity-linked debt securities could result in additional dilution to its shareholders, including us. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict its operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to Changyou, if at all. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS There are no comments that we received from the staff of the SEC 180 days or more before the end of the year ended December 31, 2015 regarding our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that remain unresolved.
