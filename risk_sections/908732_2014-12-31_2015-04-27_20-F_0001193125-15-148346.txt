D. Risk Factors - Our development and operation plans have significant capital expenditure and financing requirements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. In light of our good credit standing and various financing channels, we believe that we will not experience any difficulty in obtaining sufficient financing for our operations. We managed to maintain our asset-liability ratio at a safe level by enhancing controls over both liabilities (including borrowings) and financing risks. We generally do not experience any seasonality in borrowings. However, due to the nature of the capital expenditures plan, long term bank loans can be arranged in advance of expenditures while short term borrowings are used to meet operational needs. The terms of our existing borrowings do not restrict our ability to pay dividends on our shares. Liability-to-asset ratio As at December 31, 2014, our liability-to-asset ratio was 45.73% (2013: 50.89%). The ratio is calculated using this formula: total liabilities/total assets. Capital expenditure In 2014, our capital expenditure amounted to RMB1,089 million, representing a decrease of 17.31% as compared to RMB1,317 million in capital expenditure in 2013. Major projects include the following: Project Total projectinvestment RMBmillion Project status as at December 31, 2014 No. 3 Diesel Hydrogenation Unit Reconstruction and Diesel Quality Upgrading Project 75.0 Completed Dust Abatement and Denitrification Reconstruction of No. 1 and No. 2 Furnaces of the Department of Thermoelectricity 108.0 Completed Phase 2 Project for In-depth Treatment and Recycling of Sewage 117.0 Completed Manufacturing Facilities of EVA with a Capacity of 100,000 Tons/Year 1,132.0 Upfront work Total 1,432.0 Our capital expenditure for 2015 is estimated at approximately RMB1.6 billion. 55 Table of Contents C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. We have a number of technology development units, including the Petrochemical Research Institute, the Plastics Research Institute, the Polyester Fiber Research Institute, the Acrylic Fiber Research Institute and the Environmental Protection Research Institute. These units are charged with various research and development tasks with respect to new technology, new products, new production processes and equipment and environmental protection. Our research and development expenditures in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were RMB72.2 million, RMB67.3 million and RMB43.6 million, respectively. We are not, in any material aspect, dependent on any patents, licenses, industrial, commercial or financial contracts, or new production processes. D. Trend Information In 2015, the global economy is expected to be largely uncertain and recover slowly from the financial crisis. Although the rebound of the U.S. economy may improve the worlds economy, the U.S.s exit of its quantitative easing monetary policy may have an impact on the economies of emerging markets. Given the high level of debts of developed countries and the slowing growth rates in major economies, emerging markets are expected to enhance their efforts to adjust the structures of their economies for further development. There exists uncertainty in Chinas economic development. Chinas economy is expected to continue to grow steadily; however, a variety of factors, such as difficulties in significantly increasing domestic and foreign demand, will constrain such growth. Supply in the international crude oil market is expected to be sufficient, while market demand for crude oil may be suppressed by the pessimistic outlook for the worlds economic growth. The price of crude oil is generally expected to fluctuate in 2015. Given the strong supply of crude oil, the price of crude oil may remain unchanged or even decrease. Against this backdrop of economic and market conditions, the domestic petroleum and petrochemical markets are expected to face a tougher external business environment with market competition intensifying due to the slowing growth rate in market demand, excessive production capacity of refineries in China and abundant supply of imported petrochemical products. Stricter regulations in relation to environmental protection and resources conservation will also result in greater challenges to manufacturers. E. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2014, we had no contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees issued to banks in favor of our associated companies and other unlisted investments (December 31, 2013: nil).

Board Practices. Board of Directors Our board of directors consists of twelve members. Our directors are elected at meetings of our shareholders, and, unless they resign at an earlier date, are deceased or removed, will serve three-year terms. The directors shall be eligible for reelection upon expiry of their terms of office; however, the combined tenure of an independent director may not exceed a total of six years. The term of our current board of directors will expire in June 2017. None of our directors have entered into any service contracts with us or any of our subsidiaries providing for benefits upon termination of appointment or employment (with the exception of compensation required by Chinese labor law). Independent Board Committee We formed an Independent Board Committee on October 24, 2013, which consists of four independent non-executive directors. The current members are Shen Liqiang, Jin Mingda, Cai Tingji and Zhang Yimin. The Independent Board Committee advised our shareholders other than Sinopec Corp. and its associates in respect of the terms of the continuing connected transactions under the renewed Mutual Product Supply and Sale Services Framework Agreement with Sinopec Group and Sinopec Corp. and the renewed Comprehensive Services Framework Agreement with Sinopec Group and the proposed caps on annual transaction values thereof for the three years ending December 31, 2016. Supervisory Committee The Supervisory Committee is responsible for ensuring that our directors and senior officers act in the interests of our company or those of our shareholders or employees and that they do not abuse their positions and powers. The Supervisory Committee has no power to overturn the decisions or actions of our directors or officers and may only recommend that they correct any acts that are harmful to our interests or the interests of our shareholders or employees. The Supervisory Committee is currently composed of seven members appointed for a three year term. The term of the current members will expire in June 2017. Supervisory Committee members have the right to attend meetings of our board of directors, inspect our financial affairs and perform other supervisory functions. Audit Committee Pursuant to Paragraph 14 of the Code of Best Practices set out in Appendix 14 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The HKSE, we formed an audit committee on June 15, 1999 which consists of three directors. The current members are Cai Tingji, Shen Liqiang and Jin Mingda. The principal duty of the audit committee is to review and supervise our financial reporting process and internal controls. The members of the audit committee will hold office for the same term as their directorships which will expire in June 2017. Remuneration Committee We formed a remuneration committee on December 25, 2001 which consists of three directors. The current members are Shen Liqiang, Jing Mingda and Ye Guohua according to the Resolutions of the Fifteenth Meeting of the Seventh Session of the Board of Directors. The key responsibility of the Remuneration Committee is to formulate and review the remuneration policy and plan for the directors and executive officers, formulate the standards for evaluation of the directors and executive officers and conduct such evaluations. Summary Corporate Governance Differences There are significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those of U.S. issuers listed on the NYSE. Pursuant to Section 303A.11 of the NYSE listing Manual, we have disclosed certain of these differences on our website at http://www.spc-ir.com.hk/eng/company.asp. 65 Table of Contents D. Employees. As of December 31, 2014, we had 13,313 employees. The following table shows the approximate number of employees we had at the end of our last three years by the principal business function they performed: December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Management 1,617 1,471 1,441 Engineers, technicians and factory personnel 8,689 8,224 7,801 Accounting, marketing and others 4,701 4,432 4,071 Total 15,007 14,127 13,313 Approximately 45.30% of our work force are graduates with a tertiary degree or higher. In addition, we offer our employees opportunities for education and training based upon our development plans and requirements and the individual performance of each employee. 66 Table of Contents A system of labor contracts has been adopted in our Company. The contract system imposes discipline, provides incentives to adopt better work habits and gives us greater management control over our work force. We believe that by linking remuneration to productivity, the contract system has also improved employee morale. As of December 31, 2014, almost all of the work force was employed pursuant to labor contracts which specify the employees position, responsibilities, remuneration and grounds for termination. The contracts generally have short terms of one to five years and may be renewed with the agreement of both parties. The remaining personnel are employed for an indefinite term. We have a labor union that protects employees rights, aims to assist in the fulfillment of our economic objectives, encourages employee participation in management decisions and assists in mediating disputes between us and union members. We have not been subject to any strikes or other labor disturbances which have interfered with our operations, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. Total remuneration of our employees includes salary and bonuses. Employees also receive certain benefits in terms of housing, education and health services that we subsidize, and other miscellaneous subsidies. In 2014, we incurred RMB 2,627.4 million in employment costs. In compliance with Shanghai regulations, we and our employees participate in a defined contribution government pension scheme under which all employees upon retirement are entitled to receive pensions. In order to safeguard and properly enhance the living level of retired employees and improve the medium and long term incentive system, the company established an enterprise annuity plan. According to the plan, to the extent that the employees volunteer for the related payments and have been with the Company for one year or more, such employees are entitled to participate in the enterprise annuity plan. We will make payments to match the payments made by the employees after giving considerations to our profitability, the employees work responsibilities, contributions, and treatments post retirement based on the principle of universal benefits. We have 1312 retired employees under the above retirement insurance plans. In addition to the pension benefits, pursuant to the relevant laws and regulations of the PRC, we and our employees participate in defined social security contributions for employees, such as a housing fund, basic medical insurance, supplementary medical insurance, unemployment insurance, injury insurance and maternity insurance. 67 Table of Contents E.

The relevant connected transactions were conducted in accordance with the terms of the Mutual Product Supply and Sales Services Framework Agreement and the Comprehensive Services Framework Agreement. The current Mutual Product Supply and Sales Service Framework Agreement and Comprehensive Services Framework Agreement were renewed with Sinopec Corp. and Sinopec Group respectively upon approval and authorization at our 2013 Extraordinary General Meeting held on December 11, 2013. At the 2013 Extraordinary General Meeting, our shareholders also approved certain caps on the annual transaction values of certain ongoing continuing connected transactions for the years ending December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.

We sell petrochemicals to Sinopec Corp. and its associates and Sinopec Corp. and its associates act as agents for the sales of petrochemicals in order to reduce our inventories, expand their trading, distribution and sales networks and improve our bargaining power with our customers. We lease part of the properties to Sinopec Corp. and its associates in consideration of their good financial background and credit standing. We accept construction and installation, engineering design, insurance agency and financial services relating to the petrochemical industry from Sinopec Group and its associates in order to secure steady and reliable services at reasonable prices. 71 Table of Contents The prices of the continuing connected (i.e., related-party) transactions conducted between the Company and Sinopec Group, Sinopec Corp. and its associates are determined by the parties involved after consultation pursuant to (1) the fixed price of the state; or (2) the guiding price of the state; or (3) market prices, and the conclusion of agreements for the connected transactions are in compliance with the needs of the Companys production and operation.

You should refer to the text of the Articles of Association and to the texts of applicable laws and regulations for further information. We are a joint stock limited company established in accordance with the Company Law and certain other laws and regulations of the PRC. We are registered with the Shanghai Administration of Industry and Commerce with business license number 310000000021453. Our Articles of Association provide, at article 11, that our purpose is:  to build and operate a diversified industrial company which will be one of the worlds leading petrochemical companies;  to promote the development of the petrochemical industry in China through the production of a broad variety of outstanding products; and  to practice advanced, scientific management and apply flexible business principles, and to develop overseas markets for our products so that we and our shareholders receive reasonable economic benefits. Our scope of business is limited to matters approved by Chinese authorities. Article 12 provides that our primary business scope includes: Refining crude oil, petroleum products, petrochemical products, synthetic fibers and monomers, plastic products, raw materials for knitting and textile products, preparation of catalysts and recover waste catalysts, power, heat, water and gas supply, water treatment, railway cargo loading and unloading, inland water transport, wharf operation, warehousing, design, research and development, technology development, transfer, consultancy and other services, property management, lease of self-owned premises, internal staff training, design and fabrication of various advertisements, and release of advertisements on self-owned media (administrative license should be obtained when required). We may adjust these subject to approval by governmental authorities. The following discussion primarily concerns our shares and the rights of our shareholders. Holders of our ADSs will not be treated as our shareholders and will be required to surrender their ADSs for cancellation and withdrawal from the depositary facility in which the H shares are held in order to exercise shareholder rights in respect of H shares. Domestic shares and overseas-listed foreign invested H shares are both ordinary shares in our share capital. Domestic shares are shares we issue to domestic Chinese investors for subscription in Renminbi, while H shares are shares we issue for subscription in other currencies to investors from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and outside of China. Sources of Shareholders Rights Chinas legal system is based on written statutes and is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedent value. Chinas legal system is similar to civil law systems in this regard. In 1979, China began the process of developing its legal system by undertaking to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws. In December 1993, the Standing Committee of the 8th National Peoples Congress adopted the Chinese Company Law. Although the Chinese Company Law is expected to serve as the core of a body of regulatory measures, which will impose a uniform standard of corporate behavior on companies and their directors and shareholders, only a limited portion of this body of regulatory measures has so far been promulgated. Currently, the primary sources of shareholder rights are the Articles of Association, the Chinese Company Law and the HKSE listing rules, which, among other things, impose standards of conduct, fairness and disclosure on us, our directors and our controlling shareholder. To facilitate the offering and listing of shares of Chinese companies overseas, and to regulate the behavior of companies whose shares are listed overseas, the former State Council Securities Committee and the former State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System issued the Mandatory Provisions for articles of association of Companies Listing Overseas on August 27, 1994. These provisions have been incorporated into our Articles of Association and any amendment to those provisions will only become effective after approval by the companies approval department authorized by the State. In addition, upon the listing of and for so long as the H shares are listed on the HKSE, we will be subject to those relevant ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on the HKSE, the Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Codes on Takeovers and Mergers and Share Repurchases. 78 Table of Contents Unless otherwise specified, all rights, obligations and protections discussed below derive from our Articles of Association and/or the Chinese Company Law. Enforceability of Shareholders Rights There has not been any public disclosure in relation to the enforcement by holders of H shares of their rights under the charter documents of joint stock limited companies or the Chinese Company Law or in the application or interpretation of the Chinese or Hong Kong regulatory provisions applicable to Chinese joint stock limited companies. In most states of the United States, shareholders may sue a corporation derivatively. A derivative suit involves the commencement by a shareholder of a corporate cause of action against persons who have allegedly wronged the corporation, where the corporation itself has failed to enforce the claims directly. This would include suits against corporate officers, directors, or the controlling shareholder. This type of action is brought based upon a primary right of the corporation, but is asserted by a shareholder on behalf of the corporation. In accordance with the Company Law of the Peoples Republic of China, if a company incurs losses due to the violation of any provision of laws, administrative regulations or the companys articles of association by any of its directors, supervisors and officers during his/her discharge of duties entrusted by the company, or due to any other persons infringement of the companys legal rights or interests, the shareholders of the company may take legal action before a court under the Company Law of the Peoples Republic of China. Our Articles of Association provide that all differences or claims  between a holder of H shares and us;  between a holder of H shares and any of our directors, supervisors, manager or other senior officers; or  between a holder of H shares and a holder of domestic shares, involving any right or obligation provided in the Articles of Association, the Chinese Company Law or any other relevant law or administrative regulation which concerns our affairs must, with certain exceptions, be referred to arbitration at either the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission in China or the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center. Our Articles of Association also provide that the arbitration will be final and conclusive. On June 21, 1999, an arrangement was made between Hong Kong and China for the summary mutual enforcement of each others arbitration awards in a manner consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and practices that occurred before the handover of Hong Kong to China. This arrangement was approved by the Supreme Court of China and the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and became effective on February 1, 2000. All of our directors and officers reside outside the United States (principally in China) and substantially all of our assets and of those persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, you may not be able to effect service of process within the United States against any of those persons. In addition, China does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts within the United States or most other countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This means that administrative actions brought by regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other actions which result in foreign court judgments could only be enforced in China if the judgments or rulings do not violate the basic principles of the law of China or the sovereignty, security and social public interest of the society of China, as determined by a Peoples Court of China which has jurisdiction for recognition and enforcement of judgments. We have been advised by our Chinese counsel, Haiwen & Partners, that there is doubt as to the enforceability in China of any actions to enforce judgments of United States courts arising out of or based on the ownership of our H shares or ADSs, including judgments arising out of or based on the civil liability provisions of United States federal or state securities laws. Restrictions on Transferability and the Share Register All fully paid up H shares will be freely transferable in accordance with the Articles of Association unless otherwise prescribed by law and/or administrative regulations. Under current laws and regulations, H shares may be traded only among investors who are not Chinese persons, and may not be sold to Chinese investors. Consequences under Chinese law of a purported transfer of H shares to Chinese investors are unclear. As provided in our Articles of Association, we may refuse to register a transfer of H shares without providing any reason unless:  all relevant transfer fees and stamp duties are paid;  the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the share certificates to which it relates and any other evidence reasonably required by our board to prove the transferors right to make the transfer; 79 Table of Contents  there are no more than four joint holders as transferees; and  the H shares are free from any lien of ours. Additionally, no transfers of shares may be registered within the 30 days prior to a shareholders general meeting or within five days before we decide on the distribution of dividends. We are required to keep a register of our shareholders which shall be comprised of various parts, including one part which is to be maintained in Hong Kong in relation to H shares listed on the HKSE. Shareholders have the right to inspect the share register. For a reasonable fee, shareholders may copy any part of the share register, obtain background information regarding our directors, supervisors, manager and other senior officers, minutes of shareholder general meetings and reports regarding our share capital and any share repurchases in the prior year. Dividends Upon approval by ordinary resolution at a shareholders meeting, our Board of Directors may propose dividend distribution at any time. The Articles of Association permits dividends issued in the form of cash or shares. Special resolution of the shareholders general meeting is required for dividends issued in the form of shares. Dividends may only be distributed, however, after allowance has been made for:  recovery of losses, if any;  allocations to the statutory common reserve fund; and  allocations to a discretionary common reserve fund. The Articles of Association require us to appoint on behalf of the holders of H shares a receiving agent which is registered as a trust corporation under the Trustee Ordinance of Hong Kong to receive dividends we declare in respect of the H shares on behalf of the H shareholders. The Articles of Association require that cash dividends and other distributions in respect of H shares be declared in Renminbi and paid by us in Hong Kong dollars while cash dividends and other distributions of the domestic shares shall be paid in Renminbi. If we record no profit for the year, we may not normally distribute dividends for the year. Dividend payments may be subject to Chinese withholding tax. See Item 10. Additional Information  E. Taxation. Voting Rights and Shareholders Meetings Our board of directors must convene a shareholders annual general meeting once every year within six months from the end of the preceding financial year. Our board must convene an extraordinary general meeting within two months of the occurrence of any one of the following events:  where the number of directors is less than five as required by the Chinese Company Law or two-thirds of the number specified in our Articles of Association;  where our unrecovered losses reach one-third of the total amount of our share capital;  where shareholder(s) holding 10% or more of our issued and outstanding voting shares request(s) in writing; or  whenever our board deems necessary or our Supervisory Committee so requests. Meetings of a special class of shareholders must be called in specified situations when the rights of the holders of that class of shares may be varied or abrogated, as discussed below. The Board of Directors, the Supervisory Committee, and shareholders individually or collectively holding 3% or more of our total voting shares are entitled to make written proposals to a shareholders meeting. Shareholders individually or collectively holding more than 3% of our total shares may submit written interim proposals to the convener of a shareholders meeting ten days before the meeting. 80 Table of Contents All shareholders meetings must be convened by our board by notice given to shareholders by personal service, mail or announcement in the newspaper not less than 45 days before the meeting. Based on the written replies we receive 20 days before a shareholders meeting, we will calculate the number of voting shares represented by shareholders who have indicated that they intend to attend the meeting. We can convene the shareholders general meeting if the number of voting shares represented by those shareholders is more than one-half of our total voting shares. Otherwise, we shall, within five days, inform the shareholders again of the motions to be considered and the date and venue of the meeting by way of public announcement. After the announcement is made, the shareholders meeting may be convened. Our accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of notice of a meeting by, a shareholder will not invalidate the proceedings at that shareholders meeting. However, an extraordinary shareholders meeting cannot conduct any business not contained in the notice of meeting. Shareholders at meetings have the power, among other things, to decide on our operational policies and investment plans, to approve or reject our proposed annual budget, approve our profit distribution plans, an increase or decrease in share capital, the issuance of debentures, our merger or liquidation and any amendment to our Articles of Association. Shareholders also have the right to review any proposals by a shareholder owning 3% or more of our shares. In general, holders of H shares and domestic shares vote together as a single class at all meetings and on all matters. However, the rights of a class of shareholders may not be varied or abrogated, unless approved by both a special resolution of all shareholders at a general shareholders meeting and by a special resolution of shareholders of that class of shares at a separate meeting. Our Articles of Association specify, without limitation, that the following amendments would be deemed to be a variation or abrogation of the rights of a class of shareholders:  increasing or decreasing the number of shares of a class or of a class having voting or distribution rights or privileges equal or superior to that class;  removing or reducing rights to receive dividends in a particular currency;  creating shares with voting or distribution rights superior to shares of that class;  restricting or adding restrictions to the transfer of ownership of shares of that class;  allotting and issuing rights to subscribe for, or to convert into, shares of that class or another class;  increasing the rights or privileges of any other class; or  modifying the provision of our Articles of Association that specifies which amendments would be deemed a variation or abrogation of the rights of a class of shareholder. For votes on any of these matters, or any other matter that would vary or abrogate the rights of the domestic shares or H shares, the holders of domestic shares and H shares are deemed to be separate classes and vote separately. However, Interested Shareholders are not entitled to vote at class meetings. The meaning of Interested Shareholder depends on the proposal to be voted on at the class meeting:  If the proposal is for us to repurchase our shares either from all shareholders proportionately or by purchasing share on a stock exchange, an Interested Shareholder is our controlling shareholder;  If the proposal is for us to repurchase our shares from a shareholder by a private contract, an Interested Shareholder is the shareholder whose shares would be repurchased;  If the proposal is for our restructuring, an Interested Shareholder is any shareholder that has an interest in the restructuring different from the other shareholders of the class or who bears a burden under the proposed restructuring that is less than proportionate to his shareholdings of the class. Our Articles of Association specifically provide that an issue of up to 20% of domestic and H shares would not be a variation or abrogation of the rights of domestic shareholders or H shareholders, therefore, separate approval of the domestic shareholders or H Shareholders would not be required. Each share is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders at all shareholders meetings, except for meetings of a special class of shareholders where only holders of shares of the affected class are entitled to vote on the basis of one vote per share of the affected class. Shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at meetings either in person or by proxy. Proxy authorization forms must be in writing and deposited at our companys principal offices, or at such other place specified in the notice of shareholders meeting not less than 24 hours before the time that such meeting will be held or the time appointed for passing upon the relevant resolutions. If a proxy authorization form is signed by a third party on behalf of the relevant shareholder, then such proxy authorization form must be accompanied by the signature authorization letter or other such document authorizing such third party to sign on behalf of the shareholder. 81 Table of Contents Except for those actions discussed below, which require supermajority votes, or special resolutions, resolutions of the shareholders are passed by a simple majority of the voting shares held by shareholders who are present in person or by proxy. Special resolutions must be passed by more than two-thirds of the voting rights represented by shareholders who are present in person or by proxy. The following decisions must be adopted by special resolution:  an increase or reduction of our share capital or the issue of shares of any class, warrants and other similar securities;  the issue of our debentures;  our division, merger, dissolution and liquidation;  amendments to our Articles of Association;  significant acquisition or disposal of material assets or provision of guarantees conducted within the period of one year with a value exceeding 30% of our latest audited total assets;  share incentive schemes; and  any other matters considered by the shareholders in a general meeting and which they have resolved by way of an ordinary resolution to be material and should be adopted by special resolution. All other actions taken by the shareholders, including the appointment and removal of our directors and independent auditors and the declaration of normal dividend payments, will be decided by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders. Our listing agreement with the HKSE provides that we may not permit amendments to certain sections of our Articles of Association that are subject to the Mandatory Provisions. These sections include provisions relating to (i) varying the rights of existing classes of shares, (ii) voting rights, (iii) our ability to purchase our own shares, (iv) rights of minority shareholders and (v) procedures on liquidation. In addition, certain amendments to the Articles of Association require the approval and assent of Chinese authorities. Board of Directors Our Articles of Association authorize up to 12 directors. Directors are elected by shareholders at a general meeting for a three year term from among candidates nominated by the board of directors or by shareholders holding 3% or more of our shares (independent directors may be nominated by shareholders each holding 1% or more of our shares). Because our directors do not serve staggered terms, the entire board of directors will stand for election, and could be replaced, every three years. Our directors are not required to hold any shares in us, and there is no age limit requirement for the retirement or non- retirement of our directors. In addition to obligations imposed by laws, administrative regulations or the listing rules of the stock exchanges on which our shares are listed, the Articles of Association place on each of our directors, supervisors, manager and any other senior officers a duty to each shareholder, in the exercise of our functions and powers entrusted to them:  not to cause us to exceed the scope of business stipulated in our business license;  to act honestly in what he considers our best interests;  not to expropriate our assets in any way, including (without limitation) usurpation of opportunities which may benefit us; and  not to expropriate the individual rights of shareholders, including (without limitation) rights to distributions and voting rights, except according to a restructuring which has been submitted to the shareholders for their approval in accordance with the Articles of Association. Our Articles of Association further place on each of our directors, supervisors, manager and other senior officers:  a duty, in the exercise of their powers and discharge of their duties, to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances;  a fiduciary obligation, in the discharge of his duties, not to place himself or herself in a position where his or her interests may conflict with his or her duty to us; and  a duty not to cause a person or an organization related or connected to him or her in specified relationships to do what they are prohibited from doing. We pay all expenses that our directors incur for their services as directors. Directors also receive compensation for their services under service contracts that are negotiated by the board of directors and approved by the shareholders. 82 Table of Contents Subject to the stipulations of relevant laws and regulations, the shareholders in a general meeting may by ordinary resolution remove any director before the expiration of his term of office. Except for the restrictions placed on the controlling shareholder, discussed below, our shareholders in general meeting have the power to relieve a director or supervisor from liability for specific breaches of duty. Cumulative voting is required for a meeting of shareholders held for the election of two or more of our directors or supervisors as long as more than 30% of our outstanding shares are held by a single shareholder. Cumulative voting allows shareholders to cast a number of votes for a candidate equal to the number of shares held multiplied by the number of directors being elected at the shareholders meeting. If a shareholder attempts to cast more votes than he is entitled to under this system, all of the shareholders votes will be invalid and will be deemed an abstention. 83 Table of Contents More than one third of our directors of board must be independent from our shareholders and not hold any office with us (each, Independent Director). At least one Independent Director must be an accounting professional and all Independent Directors must possess a basic knowledge of the operations of a listed company and be familiar with relevant laws and rules and have at least five years working experience in law, economics or other area required for the fulfillment of responsibilities as an Independent Director. Independent Directors may not serve for terms exceeding six years. In addition, there are specific persons who are disqualified from acting as Independent Director. These include:  immediate family members of persons who work for us or our associated entities;  persons or their immediate family who hold one percent or more of our shares or are among our ten largest shareholders;  any persons that satisfied the foregoing conditions within the past one year;  persons providing financial, legal, consultation or other services to us or our associated entities;  persons who already serve as Independent Director for five other listed companies; and  anyone identified by the CSRC as unsuitable for serving as an Independent Director. If the resignation of an Independent Director would cause our Board of Directors to have less than one third Independent Directors, the resignation will only become effective after a new Independent Director has been appointed. Our Board will be required to meet at least four times each year. Directors who miss two consecutive Board meetings without appointing an alternate director to attend on their behalf will be proposed for removal at the next shareholders meeting, provided that Independent Directors may miss three consecutive meetings in person before being proposed for removal. Directors may not vote on any matter in which he has a material interest, nor will he be counted for purposes of forming a quorum on such a matter. Board resolutions are passed by a simple majority of the Directors except for the following matters which require the consent of more than two thirds of the Directors:  proposals for our financial policies;  the increase or reduction of our registered capital;  the issue of securities of any kind and their listing;  any repurchase of our shares;  significant acquisitions or disposals;  our merger, division or dissolution; and  any amendment to our Articles of Association. Our Board of Directors or Supervisory Committee may nominate candidates for our Board of Directors and Supervisory Committee. In addition, shareholders holding one percent or more of our shares have the right to nominate candidates for Independent Director or Independent Supervisor and shareholders holding three percent or more of our shares have the right to nominate other candidates for Director or Supervisor. For candidates for Director, the nominator and candidates will be responsible for providing truthful and complete information about the candidate for disclosure. Candidates for Independent Director must publicly declare that there does not exist any relationship between himself and us that may influence his independent, objective judgment. The CSRC may veto any candidate for Independent Director. Any material connected transactions are subject to prior approval by our Independent Directors. Connected transactions are those defined by the HKSE and by Chinese rules and regulations, but would generally include transactions with any of the following:  any company that, directly or indirectly, controls us or is under common control with us;  any shareholders owning 5% or more of our shares;  our directors, supervisors and other senior management;  any of our key technical personnel or key technology suppliers; and  any close relative or associate of any of the above. Our independent directors can also propose to the Board of Directors the appointment or removal of our auditors, the convening of a Board meeting, independently appoint external auditors, solicit votes from shareholders and report circumstances directly to shareholders, Chinese securities regulatory authorities or other government departments. Two or more may request that the Board convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders. 84 Table of Contents Our Independent Directors will have to express their opinion on specified matters to the Board or to the shareholders at a shareholders meeting, either by a single unanimous statement or individually. These matters are:  the nomination, removal and remuneration of directors or senior management;  any major loans or financial transactions with our shareholders or related enterprises and whether we have taken adequate steps to ensure repayment;  matters that the Independent Director believes may harm the rights and interests of minority shareholders; and  any other matter that they are required to opine on by applicable law or rules. These opinions must be expressed as either, agree, qualified agreement, opposition or unable to form an opinion. All but agreement must also be accompanied by a supporting explanation. If public disclosure of the matter is required, we must also disclose the opinions of our Independent Directors. Any Independent Director may engage independent institutions to provide independent opinions as the basis of their decision. We must arrange the engagement and bear any costs. Supervisory Committee The Supervisory Committee is responsible for supervising our directors and senior officers and preventing them from abusing their positions and powers or infringing upon the rights and interests of our company or those of our shareholders and employees. The Supervisory Committee has no power over the decisions or actions of our directors or officers except for requesting the directors or officers to correct any acts that are harmful to our interests. The Supervisory Committee is composed of seven members appointed for a three year term. It has the right to:  attend the meetings of our board of directors;  inspect our financial affairs;  supervise and evaluate the conduct of our directors, general manager and other senior officers in order to determine whether they violate any laws, regulations or the Articles of Association in performing their duties;  require our directors, general manager or other senior officers to correct any act harmful to our interests and those of our shareholders and employees;  verify financial reports, accounting reports, business reports, profit distribution plans and other financial information proposed to be tabled at the shareholders general meeting, and entrust registered accountants and practicing accountants to re-review such documents upon its discovery of any problems;  require the board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders;  represent us in negotiations with directors or in initiating legal proceedings against a director on our companys behalf;  conduct investigation into any identified irregularities in our operations, and where necessary, to engage accountants, legal advisers or other professionals to assist in the investigation; and  any other matters authorized by the Articles of Association. One third of our Supervisory Committee members must be employee representatives appointed by our employees. The remaining members are appointed by the shareholders in a general meeting, provided that our directors, general manager and senior officers are not eligible to serve as supervisors. The Supervisory Committee must meet at least four times a year. Decisions of the Supervisory Committee can be passed by the consents of over two thirds of all the supervisors. We will pay all reasonable expenses incurred by the Supervisory Committee in appointing professional advisors, such as lawyers, accountants or auditors. Liquidation Rights In the event of our liquidation, payment of borrowings out of our remaining assets will be made in the order of priority prescribed by applicable laws and regulations. After payment of borrowings, we will distribute the remaining property to shareholders according to the class and proportion of their shareholdings. For this purpose, the H shares will rank equally with the domestic shares. 85 Table of Contents Obligation of Shareholders Shareholders are not obligated to make any further contributions to our share capital other than as agreed by the subscriber of the relevant shares on subscription. This provision means that holders of ADSs will also not be obligated to make further contributions to our share capital. Duration We are organized as a stock limited company of indefinite duration. Increase in Share Capital The Articles of Association require that approval by a resolution of the shareholders be obtained prior to issuing new shares. New issues of shares must also be approved by the relevant Chinese authorities. Reduction of Share Capital and Purchase by Us of Our Shares We may reduce our registered share capital only upon obtaining the approval of the shareholders and, when applicable, relevant Chinese authorities. Repurchases may be made either by way of a general offer to all shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings, by purchasing our shares on a stock exchange or by an off-market contract with shareholders. Restrictions on Large or Controlling Shareholders Our Articles of Association provide that, in addition to any obligation imposed by laws and administrative regulations or required by the listing rules of the stock exchanges on which our shares are listed, a controlling shareholder cannot exercise voting rights in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders generally or of some part of the shareholders:  to relieve a director or supervisor from his or her duty to act honestly in our best interest;  to approve the expropriation by a director or supervisor (for his or her own benefit or for the benefit of another person) of our assets in any way, including, without limitation, opportunities which may benefit us; or  to approve the expropriation by a director or supervisor (for his or her own benefit or for the benefit of another person) of the individual rights of other shareholders, including, without limitation, rights to distributions and voting rights (but not according to a restructuring of our company which has been submitted for approval by the shareholders in a general meeting in accordance with our Articles of Association). A controlling shareholder, however, will not be precluded by our Articles of Association or any laws and administrative regulations or the listing rules of the stock exchanges on which our shares are listed from voting on these matters. A controlling shareholder is defined by our Articles of Association as any person who, acting alone or together with others:  has the power to elect more than one-half of the board of directors;  has the power to exercise, or to control the exercise of, 30% or more of our voting rights;  holds 30% or more of our issued and outstanding shares; or  has de facto control of us in any other way. Minutes, Accounts and Annual Report Our shareholders may inspect copies of the minutes of the shareholders general meetings during our business hours free of charge. Shareholders are also entitled to receive copies of these minutes within seven days of receipt of the reasonable charges we may require. Our fiscal year is the calendar year ending December 31. Each fiscal year, we must mail our financial report to shareholders not less than 21 days before the date of the shareholders annual general meeting. These and any interim financial statements must be prepared in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and, for so long as H shares are listed on the HKSE, must also be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to either Hong Kong accounting standards or international accounting standards. The financial statements must be approved by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders at the annual general meeting. Independent auditors are appointed each year by the shareholders at the annual meeting. 86 Table of Contents C. Material Contracts. We have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those described in
