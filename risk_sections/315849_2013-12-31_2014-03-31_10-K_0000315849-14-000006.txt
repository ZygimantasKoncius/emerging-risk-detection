BUSINESS Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation (the “Corporation”) is a Georgia bank holding company organized in 1980, which, in 1981, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Southwest Georgia Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank commenced operations as Moultrie National Bank in 1928. Currently, it is a state-chartered bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). The Corporation’s primary business is providing banking services through the Bank to individuals and businesses principally in Colquitt County, Baker County, Thomas County, Worth County, Lowndes County, and the surrounding counties of southwest Georgia. The Bank also operates Empire Financial Services, Inc. (“Empire”), a commercial mortgage banking firm located in Baldwin County. The Corporation’s executive office is located at 25 Second Avenue, S. W., Moultrie, Georgia 31768, and its telephone number is (229) 985-1120. All references herein to the Corporation include Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation, the Bank, and Empire, unless the context indicates a different meaning. General The Corporation is a registered bank holding company. All of the Corporation’s activities are currently conducted by the Bank and Empire. The Bank is community-oriented and offers such customary banking services as consumer and commercial checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, lines of credit, VISA® business accounts, and money transfers. The Bank finances commercial and consumer transactions, makes secured and unsecured loans, and provides a variety of other banking services. The Bank has a trust and brokerage division that performs corporate, pension, and personal trust services and acts as trustee, executor, and administrator for estates and as administrator or trustee of various types of employee benefit plans for corporations and other organizations. Also, the trust and brokerage area has a securities sales department which offers full-service brokerage services through a third party service provider. The Bank’s Southwest Georgia Insurance Services Division offers property and casualty insurance, life, health, and disability insurance. Empire, a subsidiary of the Bank, offers commercial mortgage banking services. Markets The Corporation conducts banking activities in five counties in southwest and south central Georgia. Population characteristics in these counties range from rural to more metropolitan. Our most recent and largest market is Lowndes County with a total population of 114,552 and the highest growth rate in our markets at 21.51% from 2002 to 2012. Due primarily to the location of a state university and a large air force base in Lowndes County, this market has a median age estimated at 29.8, younger than an average median age of 38.8 in the other four counties that the Bank primarily serves. These counties, Colquitt, Worth, Thomas, and Baker, have an average total population of 28,992 and an average growth in population of 4.15% from 2002 to 2012. Per capita income in Lowndes County was $19,867, slightly higher than an average of $18,483 for the rest of the Bank’s markets. Agriculture plays a major economic role in the Bank’s markets. Colquitt, Worth, Thomas, Lowndes, and Baker Counties produce a large portion of our state’s crops, including cotton, peanuts, and a variety of vegetables. Empire provides mortgage banking primarily for commercial properties throughout the southeastern United States. Deposits The Bank offers a full range of depository accounts and services to both consumers and businesses. At December 31, 2013, the Corporation’s deposit base, totaling $310,434,539, consisted of $81,828,637 in noninterest-bearing demand deposits (26.4% of total deposits), $113,021,795 in interest-bearing demand deposits including money market accounts (36.4% of total deposits), $28,791,929 in savings deposits (9.3% of total deposits), $49,835,865 in time deposits in amounts less than $100,000 (16.0% of total deposits), and $36,956,313 in time deposits of $100,000 or more (11.9% of total deposits). 3 Loans The Bank makes both secured and unsecured loans to individuals, corporations, and other businesses. Both consumer and commercial lending operations include various types of credit for the Bank’s customers. Secured loans include first and second real estate mortgage loans. The Bank also makes direct installment loans to consumers on both a secured and unsecured basis. At December 31, 2013, consumer installment, real estate (including construction and mortgage loans), and commercial (including financial and agricultural) loans represented approximately 1.6%, 78.4% and 20%, respectively, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. Lending Policy The current lending policy of the Bank is to offer consumer and commercial credit services to individuals and businesses that meet the Bank’s credit standards. The Bank provides each lending officer with written guidelines for lending activities. Lending authority is delegated by the Board of Directors of the Bank to loan officers, each of whom is limited in the amount of secured and unsecured loans which can be made to a single borrower or related group of borrowers. The Loan Committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for approving and monitoring the loan policy and providing guidance and counsel to all lending personnel. This committee also approves all extensions of credit over $300,000. The Loan Committee is composed of the Chief Executive Officer and President, and other executive officers of the Bank, as well as certain Bank directors. Servicing and Origination Fees on Loans The Corporation through its subsidiary, Empire, recognizes as income in the current period all loan origination and brokerage fees collected on loans closed for investing participants. Loan servicing fees are based on a percentage of loan interest paid by the borrower and are recognized over the term of the loan as loan payments are received. Empire does not directly fund any mortgages and acts as a service-oriented broker for participating mortgage lenders. Fees charged for continuing servicing fees are comparable with market rates. In 2013, Bank revenue received from mortgage banking services was $939,874 compared with $1,675,936 in 2012. All of this income was from Empire except for $372,637 in 2013 and $354,375 in 2012, which was mortgage banking income from the Bank. Loan Review and Nonperforming Assets The Bank regularly reviews its loan portfolio to determine deficiencies and corrective action to be taken. Loan reviews are prepared by the Bank’s loan review officer and presented periodically to the Board’s Loan Committee and the Audit Committee. Also, the Bank’s external auditors as well as an outside third party firm conduct independent loan review adequacy tests and their findings are included annually as part of the overall report to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors. Certain loans are monitored more often by the loan review officer and the Loan Committee. These loans include non-accruing loans, loans more than 90 days past due, and other loans, regardless of size, that may be considered high risk based on factors defined within the Bank’s loan review policy. Asset/Liability Management The Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is established by the Bank’s Board of Directors and is charged with establishing policies to manage the assets and liabilities of the Bank. Its task is to manage asset growth, net interest margin, liquidity, and capital in order to maximize income and reduce interest rate risk. To meet these objectives while maintaining prudent management of risks, the ALCO directs the Bank’s overall acquisition and allocation of funds. At its monthly meetings, the ALCO reviews and discusses the monthly asset and liability funds budget and income and expense budget in relation to the actual composition and flow of funds; the ratio of the amount of rate sensitive assets to the amount of rate sensitive liabilities; the ratio of loan loss reserve to outstanding loans; and other variables, such as expected loan demand, investment opportunities, core deposit growth within specified categories, regulatory changes, monetary policy adjustments, and the overall state of the local, state, and national economy. The Board of Directors reviews ALCO data quarterly. 4 Investment Policy The Bank’s investment portfolio policy is to maximize income consistent with liquidity, asset quality, and regulatory constraints. The policy is reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors. Individual transactions, portfolio composition, and performance are reviewed and approved monthly by the Board of Directors. Employees The Bank had 112 full-time employees and five part-time employees at December 31, 2013. The Bank is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement, and the Bank believes that its employee relations are good. Competition The banking business is highly competitive. The Bank and Empire compete with other depository institutions and other financial service organizations, including brokers, finance companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions and certain governmental agencies. The Bank ranks fourth out of twenty-six banks in a six county region (Baker, Brooks, Colquitt, Lowndes, Thomas, and Worth) in deposit market share. Monetary Policies The results of operations of the Bank are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in U. S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of action by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and earnings of the Bank. Payment of Dividends The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Most of the revenue of the Corporation results from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank, as well as by the Corporation to its stockholders. Under the regulations of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance (“DBF”), dividends may not be declared out of the retained earnings of a state bank without first obtaining the written permission of the DBF, unless such bank meets all the following requirements: (a) total classified assets as of the most recent examination of the bank do not exceed 80% of equity capital (as defined by regulation); (b) the aggregate amount of dividends declared or anticipated to be declared in the calendar year does not exceed 50% of the net profits after taxes but before dividends for the previous calendar year; and (c) the ratio of equity capital to adjusted assets is not less than 6%. The payment of dividends by the Corporation and the Bank may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. In addition, if, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending upon the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) has issued a policy statement providing that insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. In addition to the formal statutes and regulations, regulatory authorities consider the adequacy of each of the Bank’s total capital in relation to its assets, deposits and other such items. Capital adequacy considerations could further limit the availability of dividends to the Bank. At December 31, 2013, net assets available from the Bank to pay dividends without prior approval from regulatory authorities totaled $1,422,558. For 2013, the Corporation’s cash dividend payout to stockholders was $509,567. 5 Supervision and Regulation General. The following is a brief summary of the supervision and regulation of the Corporation and the Bank as financial institutions and is not intended to be a complete discussion of all NYSE MKT LLC, state or federal rules, statutes and regulations affecting their operations, or that apply generally to business corporations or companies listed on NYSE MKT LLC. Changes in the rules, statutes and regulations applicable to the Corporation and the Bank can affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Corporation is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Corporation Act of 1956, as amended (the “Federal Reserve Act”). The Corporation is required to file annual and quarterly financial information with the Federal Reserve and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that it does not already control; (2) it or any of its non-bank subsidiaries may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank; and (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In addition, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities. This prohibition does not apply to activities listed in the Federal Reserve Act or found by the Federal Reserve, by order or regulation, to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation or order to be closely related to banking are: * making, acquiring or servicing loans and certain types of leases; * performing certain data processing services; * acting as fiduciary or investment or financial advisor; * providing brokerage services; * underwriting bank eligible securities; * underwriting debt and equity securities on a limited basis through separately capitalized subsidiaries; and * making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. Although the activities of bank holding companies have traditionally been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking (as discussed above), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”) relaxed the previous limitations and permitted bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities. Specifically, bank holding companies may elect to become financial holding companies which may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. Among the activities that are deemed “financial in nature” include: * lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others or safeguarding money or securities; * insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability, or death, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker with respect thereto; * providing financial, investment, or economic advisory services, including advising an investment company; * issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; and * underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company under this statute only if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. A bank holding company that falls out of compliance with such requirement may be required to cease engaging in certain activities. Any bank holding company that does not elect to become a financial holding company remains subject to the bank holding company restrictions of the Federal Reserve Act. Under this legislation, the Federal Reserve serves as the primary “umbrella” regulator of financial holding companies with supervisory authority over each parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries. The primary regulator of each subsidiary of a financial holding company will depend on the type of activity conducted by the subsidiary. For example, broker-dealer subsidiaries will be regulated largely by securities regulators and insurance subsidiaries will be regulated largely by insurance authorities. The Corporation has no current plans to register as a financial holding company. The Corporation must also register with the DBF and file periodic information with the DBF. As part of such registration, the DBF requires information with respect to the financial condition, operations, management and intercompany relationships of the Corporation and the Bank and related matters. The DBF may also require such other information as is necessary to keep itself informed as to whether the provisions of Georgia law and the regulations and orders issued thereunder by the DBF have been complied with, and the DBF may examine the Corporation and the Bank. The Corporation is an “affiliate” of the Bank under the Federal Reserve Act, which imposes certain restrictions on (1) loans by the Bank to the Corporation, (2) investments in the stock or securities of the Corporation by the Bank, (3) the Bank’s taking the stock or securities of an “affiliate” as collateral for loans by the Bank to a borrower, and (4) the purchase of assets from the Corporation by the Bank. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. The Bank is regularly examined by the FDIC. As a state banking association organized under Georgia law, the Bank is subject to the supervision and the regular examination of the DBF. Both the FDIC and DBF must grant prior approval of any merger, consolidation or other corporation reorganization involving the Bank. 6 Capital Adequacy. Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have implemented substantially identical risk-based rules for assessing bank and bank holding company capital adequacy. These regulations establish minimum capital standards in relation to assets and off-balance sheet exposures as adjusted for credit risk. Banks and bank holding companies are required to have (1) a minimum level of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%; and (2) a minimum tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 4%. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have established a minimum 3% leverage ratio of tier I capital to quarterly average total assets for the most highly-rated banks and bank holding companies. “tier I capital” generally consists of common equity excluding unrecognized gains and losses on available for sale securities, plus minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and certain perpetual preferred stock less certain intangibles. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC will require a bank holding company and a bank, respectively, to maintain a leverage ratio greater than 4% if either is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well-diversified risks in the opinion of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC use the leverage ratio in tandem with the risk-based ratio to assess the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC consider interest rate risk in the overall determination of a bank’s capital ratio, requiring banks with greater interest rate risk to maintain adequate capital for the risk. The “prompt corrective action” provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act set forth five regulatory zones in which all banks are placed largely based on their capital positions. Regulators are permitted to take increasingly harsh action as a bank’s financial condition declines. Regulators are also empowered to place in receivership or require the sale of a bank to another depository institution when a bank’s tangible equity to total assets is 2% or below. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital. The FDIC has adopted regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of the 1991 Act, which place financial institutions in the following five categories based upon capitalization ratios: (1) a “well capitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a tier I risk-based ratio of at least 6% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%; (2) an “adequately capitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a tier I risk-based ratio of at least 4% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%; (3) an “undercapitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 8%, a tier I risk-based ratio of under 4% or a leverage ratio of under 4%; (4) a “significantly undercapitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 6%, a tier I risk-based ratio of under 3% or a leverage ratio of under 3%; and (5) a “critically undercapitalized” institution has tangible assets to total equity of 2% or less. Institutions in any of the three undercapitalized categories would be prohibited from declaring dividends or making capital distributions. The FDIC regulations also establish procedures for “downgrading” an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the most recent notifications from the FDIC categorized the Bank as “well capitalized” under current regulations. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework applicable to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and all and savings and loan holding companies except for those that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or commercial activities (collectively, “banking organizations”). The final rules implement the regulatory capital reforms proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), known as “Basel III”, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country’s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply. 7 The final rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to U.S. banking organizations. Among other things, the final rules: establish a new minimum common equity tier I capital requirement of 4.5%, a higher minimum tier I capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 6.0% and a higher minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 8.0% that will be phased in and fully effective in 2015; provide, to be considered “well-capitalized”, a new common equity tier I capital requirement of 6.5%, a higher tier I capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 8.0% and a higher total capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 10.0% that will be phased in and fully effective in 2015; stratify risk-weighting of mortgage loans from 35-200% and add 20% risk-weighting for short term unused loan commitments; assign higher risk-weightings (150%) to credit exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain “high volatility commercial real estate loans” that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property; mandate that, for banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets, the ability to treat trust preferred securities as tier I capital will be phased out over a ten-year period; require that unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements; and limit a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of an additional 2.5% of common equity tier I capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements that will be phased in and fully effective in 2019. The final rules and changes to regulatory capital requirements described above will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards for financial institutions of all sizes. Therefore, to continue to conduct its business as currently conducted, the Corporation and the Bank will need to maintain capital well above the minimum levels. Commercial Real Estate. In December 2007, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued a final guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending, noting that recent increases in banks’ commercial real estate concentrations could create safety and soundness concerns in the event of a significant economic downturn. The guidance mandates certain minimal risk management practices and categorizes banks with defined levels of such concentrations as banks requiring elevated examiner scrutiny. Management believes that the Corporation’s credit processes and procedures meet the risk management standards dictated by this guidance. Loans. Inter-agency guidelines adopted by federal bank regulators mandate that financial institutions establish real estate lending policies with maximum allowable real estate loan-to-value limits, subject to an allowable amount of non-conforming loans as a percentage of capital. Transactions with Affiliates. Under federal law, all transactions between and among a state nonmember bank and its affiliates, which include holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, this law limits these transactions to a percentage of the bank’s capital and requires all of them to be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. The FDIC is authorized to impose additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a bank. The regulations also set forth various reporting requirements relating to transactions with affiliates. Financial Privacy. In accordance with the GLB Act, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 8 Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating terrorist financing. This has generally been accomplished by amending existing anti-money laundering laws and regulations. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”) has imposed significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties. The United States Treasury Department (“Treasury”) has issued a number of implementing regulations which apply to various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to the Corporation and the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act resulted in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector. The Dodd-Frank Act includes the following provisions that, among other things: · Created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with power to promulgate and enforce consumer protection laws. Smaller depository institutions, those with $10 billion or less in assets, will be subject to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule-writing authority, and existing depository institution regulatory agencies will retain examination and enforcement authority for such institutions. · Established a Financial Stability Oversight Council chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose a systemic risk. · Implemented corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by stockholders, that apply to all companies whose securities are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), not just financial institutions. · Changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital. · Provided that interchange fees for debit cards will be set by the Federal Reserve under a restrictive “reasonable and proportional cost” per transaction standard. This provision is known as the “Durbin Amendment.” In June 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted regulations for banks with total assets exceeding $10 billion, setting the maximum permissible interchange fee as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to one cent per transaction if the issuer implements certain fraud-prevention standards. At this time it is uncertain whether this new fee structure will impact us. · Applied the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies and require the FDIC and Federal Reserve to seek to make their respective capital requirements for state nonmember banks and bank holding companies countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. · Made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and provides unlimited federal deposit insurance until December 31, 2012 for non-interest bearing transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions. · Repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. · Required the regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule”. The Federal Reserve adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule on December 10, 2013. Although we continue to evaluate the impact of the Volcker Rule and the final rules adopted by the Federal Reserve thereunder, we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on us or the Bank’s operations because neither entity engages in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. 9 Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us, our customers or the financial industry more generally. Incentive Compensation. In 2010, the federal banking agencies issued guidance on incentive compensation policies (the “Incentive Compensation Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an institution, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institution’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the institution’s board of directors. The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions like ours that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institution’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the financial institution’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution’s safety and soundness and the institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. The federal banking agencies have proposed rule-making implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to prohibit incentive-based compensation plans that expose “covered financial institutions” to inappropriate risks. Covered financial institutions are institutions that have over $1 billion in assets and offer incentive-based compensation programs. The proposed rules would: · provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, · be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and · be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors and appropriate policies, procedures and monitoring. The scope and content of banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate its key employees. 10 Fair Value. The Corporation’s impaired loans and foreclosed assets may be measured and carried at “fair value”, the determination of which requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments. When a loan is considered impaired, a specific valuation allowance is allocated or a partial charge-off is taken, if necessary, so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. In addition, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost or “fair value”, less cost to sell, following foreclosure. “Fair value” is defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) “as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” GAAP further defines an “orderly transaction” as “a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets; it is not a forced transaction (for example, a forced liquidation or distress sale).” Recently in the Bank’s markets there have been very few transactions in the type of assets which represent the vast majority of the Bank’s impaired loans and foreclosed properties which reflect “orderly transactions” as so defined. Instead, most transactions in comparable assets have been distressed sales not indicative of “fair value.” Accordingly, the determination of fair value in the current environment is difficult and more subjective than it would be in a stable real estate environment. Although management believes its processes for determining the value of these assets are appropriate factors and allow the Corporation to arrive at a fair value, the processes require management judgment and assumptions and the value of such assets at the time they are revalued or divested may be significantly different from management’s determination of fair value. Because of this increased subjectivity in fair value determinations, there is greater than usual grounds for differences in opinions, which may result in increased disagreements between management and the Bank’s regulators, disagreements which could impair the relationship between the Bank and its regulators. Future Legislation. Various legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. The nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions is very unpredictable at this time.

The increase was mainly due to purchases of $29,669,489 of U.S. Government Agency securities, corporate notes and municipal securities. Partially offsetting these purchases were calls and maturities of $5,709,360 of U.S. Government Agency securities and municipal securities as well as residential mortgage-backed securities principal paydowns of approximately $8,130,000. Additionally, we sold 60,000 shares of FNMA preferred stock resulting in a net gain of $311,800. 18 The following table shows the contractual maturities of debt securities at December 31, 2013, and the weighted average yields (for nontaxable obligations on a fully taxable basis assuming a 34% tax rate) of such securities.

Summary of Loan Loss Experience The following table is a summary of average loans outstanding during the reported periods, changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off by loan category, and additions to the allowance which have been charged to operating expenses. 20 Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Average loans outstanding $215,040 $193,532 $173,341 $160,356 $153,149 Amount of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period $2,845 $3,100 $2,755 $2,533 $2,376 Amount of loans charged off during period: Commercial, financial and agricultural 18 286 236 92 227 Real estate: Construction 0 249 0 30 0 Commercial 161 9 445 416 0 Residential 46 241 113 52 147 Agricultural 0 0 0 0 0 Consumer & other 9 12 13 92 54 Total loans charged off 234 797 807 682 428 Amount of recoveries during period: Commercial, financial and agricultural 23 60 63 263 0 Real estate: Construction 0 0 0 0 0 Commercial 5 11 74 0 0 Residential 13 19 21 0 0 Agricultural 0 0 0 0 0 Consumer & other 6 7 11 41 49 Total loans recovered 47 97 169 304 49 Net loans charged off during period 187 700 638 378 379 Additions to allowance for loan losses charged to operating expense during period 420 445 983 600 536 Amount of allowance for loan losses at end of period $3,078 $2,845 $3,100 $2,755 $2,533 Ratio of net charge-offs during period to average loans outstanding for the period .09% .36% .37% .24% .25% The allowance is based upon management’s analysis of the portfolio under current economic conditions. This analysis includes a study of loss experience, a review of delinquencies, and an estimate of the possibility of loss in view of the risk characteristics of the portfolio. Based on the above factors, management considers the current allowance to be adequate. Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses Management has allocated the allowance for loan losses within the categories of loans set forth in the table below based on historical experience of net charge-offs. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories. The amount of the allowance applicable to each category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans are presented below. 21 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Category Allocation % of Total Loans Allocation % of Total Loans Allocation % of Total Loans (Dollars in thousands) Commercial, financial and agricultural $ 298 20.0% $ 310 19.8% $ 392 20.2% Real estate: Construction 1,032 7.3% 1,032 8.3% 1,123 7.3% Commercial 1,192 36.0% 1,047 34.3% 1,047 33.4% Residential 301 29.3% 285 30.6% 365 32.6% Agricultural 77 5.8% 0 5.0% 0 3.5% Consumer & other 178 1.6% 171 2.0% 173 3.0% Total $ 3,078 100.0% $ 2,845 100.0% $ 3,100 100.0% December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Category Allocation % of Total Loans Allocation % of Total Loans Commercial, financial and agricultural $ 134 17.7% $ 123 18.5% Real estate: Construction 1,396 10.7% 1,283 9.7% Commercial 686 30.2% 631 31.4% Residential 302 32.7% 278 32.1% Agricultural 0 5.3% 0 4.5% Consumer & other 237 3.4% 218 3.8% Total $ 2,755 100.0% $ 2,533 100.0% The calculation is based upon total loans including unearned interest and discount. Management believes that the portfolio is diversified and, to a large extent, secured without undue concentrations in any specific risk area. Control of loan quality is regularly monitored by management, the loan committee, and is reviewed by the Bank’s Board of Directors which meets monthly. Independent external review of the loan portfolio is provided by examinations conducted by regulatory authorities. The amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses charged to operating expense for the periods indicated were based upon many factors, including actual charge-offs and evaluations of current economic conditions in the market area. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential loan losses. Table 5 - Deposits The average amounts of deposits for the last three years are presented below.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in the Corporation’s common stock and the Corporation’s financial results are subject to a number of risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those generally affecting the industry in which the Corporation operates and risks that management currently deems immaterial, may arise or become material in the future and affect the Corporation’s business. As a bank holding company, adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operation. Continued weakness or adverse changes in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which the Corporation operates could adversely impact our business, including causing one or more of the following negative developments: · a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Corporation; · a decrease in the value of the Corporation’s loans secured by consumer or commercial real estate; · an impairment of the Corporation’s assets, such as its intangible assets, goodwill, or deferred tax assets; or · an increase in the number of customers or other counterparties who default on their loans or other obligations to the Corporation, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses. For example, if the Corporation is unable to continue to generate, or demonstrate that it can continue to generate, sufficient taxable income in the near future, then it may not be able to fully realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets and may be required to recognize a valuation allowance, similar to an impairment of those assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the Corporation’s deferred tax assets will not be realized. Such a development, or one or more other negative developments resulting from adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment, some of which are described above, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation’s ability to raise capital could be limited, affect its liquidity, and could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Current conditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to the Corporation on reasonable terms if it needed to raise capital. In such case, there is no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to borrow funds or successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to existing stockholders. 24 Liquidity is essential to the Corporation’s businesses and it relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations. Liquidity is essential to the Corporation’s businesses. The Corporation’s capital resources and liquidity could be negatively impacted by disruptions in its ability to access these sources of funding. With continued concerns about bank failures, traditional deposit customers remain concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Customers may withdraw deposits from the Corporation’s subsidiary bank in an effort to ensure that the amount that they have on deposit is fully insured. In addition, the cost of brokered and other out-of-market deposits and potential future regulatory limits on the interest rate the Corporation may pay for brokered deposits could make them unattractive sources of funding. Factors that the Corporation cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, could impair its ability to raise funding. Other financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy generally and, given the sluggish economy, there may not be a viable market for raising short or long-term debt or equity capital. In addition, the Corporation’s ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of its long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed if the Corporation is downgraded or put on (or remains on) negative watch by the rating agencies, suffers a decline in the level of its business activity or regulatory authorities take significant action against it, among other reasons. If the Corporation is unable to raise funding using the methods described above, it would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets to meet maturing liabilities. The Corporation may be unable to sell some of its assets, or it may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The Corporation’s construction and land development loans are subject to unique risks that could adversely affect earnings. The Corporation’s construction and land development loan portfolio was $15.9 million at December 31, 2013, comprising 7.3% of total loans. Construction and land development loans are often riskier than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. In the event of a general economic slowdown, they would represent higher risk due to slower sales and reduced cash flow that could impact the borrowers’ ability to repay on a timely basis. In addition, although regulations and regulatory policies affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change and we cannot predict when changes will occur or the ultimate effect of any changes, there has been recent regulatory focus on construction, development and other commercial real estate lending. Recent changes in the federal policies applicable to construction, development or other commercial real estate loans make us subject to substantial limitations with respect to making such loans, increase the costs of making such loans, and require us to have a greater amount of capital to support this kind of lending, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition. Recent performance may not be indicative of future performance. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, competition and the ability to find and retain talented people, may impede the Corporation’s ability to remain profitable. A deterioration in asset quality could have an adverse impact on the Corporation. A significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of diverse real and personal property that may be affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, environmental contamination and other external events. In addition, decreases in real estate property values due to the nature of the Bank’s loan portfolio, over 78% of which is secured by real estate, could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans. The Bank’s loan policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 25 Changes in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect the results of operations of the Corporation and the value of its assets. The Corporation’s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, known as the interest rate spread, is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the level of nonperforming assets. Fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for the Corporation’s products and services. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities may re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than interest-earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Changes in the level of interest rates may also negatively affect the value of the Corporation’s assets and its ability to realize book value from the sale of those assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings. If the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings would decrease. The Bank’s loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant loan losses which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses inherent in the portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, management relies on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information. As a result of these considerations, the Corporation has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Corporation recorded an allowance for possible loan losses of $3.08 million, compared with $2.84 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. If those assumptions are incorrect, the allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. The Corporation may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of the Bank’s and Empire’s loan customers, third party service providers and employees. When the Bank and Empire make loans to individuals or entities, they rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant’s loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower’s net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While they attempt to verify information provided through available sources, they cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. The Bank and Empire’s reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s profitability or financial condition. Technology difficulties or failures or cyber security breaches of our network security could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. The Corporation depends upon data processing, software, and communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks. The computer platforms and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cyber security issues. The Corporation cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to cyber-attack or other technological difficulties or failures. The Corporation relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Corporation could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customers and expose us to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 26 The Corporation’s business is subject to the success of the local economies and real estate markets in which it operates. The Corporation’s banking operations are located in southwest Georgia. Because of the geographic concentration of its operations, the Corporation’s success depends largely upon economic conditions in this area, which include volatility in the agricultural market, influx and outflow of major employers in the area, and minimal population growth throughout the region. Deterioration in economic conditions in the communities in which the Corporation operates could adversely affect the quality of the Corporation’s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation is less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of more diverse economies. The Corporation may face risks with respect to its ability to execute its business strategy. The financial performance and profitability of the Corporation will depend on its ability to execute its strategic plan and manage its future growth. Moreover, the Corporation’s future performance is subject to a number of factors beyond its control, including pending and future federal and state banking legislation, regulatory changes, unforeseen litigation outcomes, inflation, lending and deposit rate changes, interest rate fluctuations, increased competition and economic conditions. Accordingly, these issues could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation depends on its key personnel, and the loss of any of them could adversely affect the Corporation. The Corporation’s success depends to a significant extent on the management skills of its existing executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with the Corporation for many years. The loss or unavailability of any of its key personnel, including DeWitt Drew, President and CEO; John J. Cole, Jr., Executive Vice President and COO; Jeffery E. Hanson, Executive Vice President and CBO; Randall L. “Andy” Webb, Executive Vice President and CCO; George R. Kirkland, Executive Vice President & Treasurer; and Charles R. Lemons, President and CEO of Empire, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, and results of operations or liquidity. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect the Corporation. The banking business is highly competitive, and the Corporation experiences competition in its markets from many other financial institutions. The Corporation competes with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Many of its competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions that are able to operate profitably with a narrower net interest margin and have a more diverse revenue base. The Corporation may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread costs across broader markets. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to compete effectively in its markets. Furthermore, developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements is uncertain. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued final rules to implement Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd Frank Act that substantially change the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to banking organizations. The final rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which will be phased in beginning January 1, 2015, and modify the capital and asset definitions for purposes of calculating those ratios. Among other things, as of January 1, 2015, the final rules establish a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%, a higher minimum tier 1capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 6.0% and a higher total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. In addition, the final rules provide, to be considered “well-capitalized”, a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement of 6.5% and a higher tier 1capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 8.0% that will be phased in and fully effective as of January 1, 2015. Moreover, the final rules limit a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if such banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of a 2.5% of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the 4.5% minimum common equity tier 1 requirement and the other amounts necessary to meet the minimum risk-based capital requirements that will be phased in and fully effective in 2019. 27 While the Basel III only apply to larger financial institutions, changing regulatory capital requirements will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards for financial institutions of all sizes and it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to the Corporation and the Bank. The application of the more stringent capital requirements described above could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in additional regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in us modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make dividends. Changes in government regulation or monetary policy could adversely affect the Corporation. The Corporation and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which the Corporation conducts its banking business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit holders of the Corporation’s securities. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is in the control of the Corporation. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affects credit conditions for the Corporation, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
