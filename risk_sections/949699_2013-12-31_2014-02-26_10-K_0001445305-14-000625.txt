Item 1A. Risk FactorsAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Anyone who is making an investment decision regarding our securities should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company or your investment. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material, or of which we are not presently aware, may become important factors that adversely affect our security holders or us in the future. If any of the risks discussed below actually materialize, then our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and future prospects, or your investment in our securities, could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment.Risks Relating to PharmacyclicsIMBRUVICATM (ibrutinib) is our only approved product.On November 13, 2013, we obtained approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to market IMBRUVICATM to treat patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and on February 12, 2014 to treat patients with CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy. This is the only marketing approval for IMBRUVICATM we have received anywhere in the world. Unless we and our collaboration partner, Janssen, can obtain regulatory approval of, and successfully commercialize, IMBRUVICATM to treat other patient populations within the U.S., or any patient populations outside the U.S., we will be solely dependent on U.S. sales of IMBRUVICATM to treat patients with MCL and CLL who in each case have received at least one prior therapy to generate revenue and fund our operations.Our prospects are largely dependent on (a) successful commercialization of IMBRUVICATM in the U.S. to treat patients with MCL and CLL who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, (b) obtaining regulatory approval of, and 21successfully commercializing, IMBRUVICATM outside the U.S. to treat patients with MCL and CLL who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, and (c) obtaining regulatory approval of, and successfully commercializing, IMBRUVICATM both in and outside the U.S. to treat other indications. If we are unsuccessful in achieving any one or more of these critical business objectives, our ability to generate significant revenue or achieve profitability will be adversely affected and our business may fail.The commercialization of IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of patients with MCL and CLL who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, or any other patient populations for which IMBRUVICATM may subsequently be approved may not be successful for a number of reasons, including:•we and our collaborative partner, Janssen, may not be able to establish or demonstrate in the medical community the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICATM and its potential advantages over and side effects compared to competing therapeutics and products currently in clinical development for each applicable patient population;•our limited experience in marketing IMBRUVICATM for any patient population;•reimbursement and coverage policies of government and private payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators;•the relative price of IMBRUVICATM as compared to alternative treatment options;•changed or increased regulatory restrictions;•changes to the label for IMBRUVICATM that further restrict how we and Janssen market IMBRUVICATM, including as a result of data collected from the safety study of platelets in patients that the FDA required us to undertake as a post-marketing requirement or from any other ongoing or future studies;•we may not have adequate financial or other resources to successfully commercialize IMBRUVICATM; and•we and Janssen may not be able to obtain adequate commercial supplies of IMBRUVICATM to meet demand or at an acceptable cost.If the commercialization of IMBRUVICATM is unsuccessful, our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability will be adversely affected and our business could fail.Our success will depend on our ability to effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICATM.Our success will depend on our ability to effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICATM, which will include our ability to:•create market demand for IMBRUVICATM through education, marketing and sales activities;•achieve market acceptance and generate product sales;•receive adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers, such as private insurance programs;•comply with post-marketing requirements established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for IMBRUVICATM, and any other requirements established by the FDA in the future;•conduct the post-marketing studies required by the FDA;•comply with other healthcare regulatory requirements;•ensure that the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for IMBRUVICATM and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with an acceptable quality and pricing level in order to meet commercial demand; and•ensure that the entire supply chain for IMBRUVICATM - from API to finished product - efficiently and consistently delivers IMBRUVICATM to our customers.Prior to commercialization of IMBRUVICATM, we have not had any commercial products. While many members of our management and key personnel have significant experience launching and commercializing drugs at other companies, we have not worked together to commercialize any drug in the past and we cannot be certain that we will be successful. If we are unable to successfully commercialize IMBRUVICATM, our ability to generate product sales will be severely limited, which will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.22Acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance may harm our business.Although approved for marketing for the treatment of patients with MCL and CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, IMBRUVICATM may not achieve market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance for IMBRUVICATM and our other product candidates will depend upon a number of factors, including:•the receipt of regulatory approvals for the additional indications of IMBRUVICATM and the desired indications for our other product candidates, and the acceptance by physicians and patients of the clinical benefits that IMBRUVICATM and our other product candidates may offer;•the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMBRUVICATM our other product candidates and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products;•marketing and distribution support;•the introduction, market penetration and pricing strategies of competing and future products;•coverage and reimbursement policies of governmental and other third- party payers such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators; and•physicians, patients, payers or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, purchase, utilize or recommend IMBRUVICATM or any of our other product candidates.If growth in sales of our product is slow or perceived to be slow in the first few months after product launch, future sales of the product may be reduced. We have commercially launched IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of patients with MCL and CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy. The growth in sales of IMBRUVICATM during the months immediately following the product’s commercial launch, as reported by us and/or market analysts, may be or may be perceived to be slow, flat or negative. Historically, the speed and size of the growth in sales of a new pharmaceutical product during the first few months of sales will define or have a lasting impact on the future sales performance of the product. We cannot guarantee that the growth in sales of IMBRUVICATM will be reported or perceived to be strong during the months immediately following the product’s commercial launch. If during the months immediately following the product’s commercial launch the growth in sales of IMBRUVICATM is reported and/or perceived to be slow, flat or negative, IMBRUVICATM likely would not generate the interest or momentum necessary for the product to reach its full potential over time, causing a lasting reduction in the sales performance of IMBRUVICATM and a commensurate diminution of the value of our business.If we are unable to obtain marketing approvals for IMBRUVICATM outside the United States, or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our results of operations and business will be materially and adversely affected and our stock price would likely decline. In October 2013, our partner Janssen filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for IMBRUVICATM in the European Union, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, accepted the filing for review. By and also through our partner Janssen, we also plan to seek regulatory approval of IMBRUVICATM in approximately 50 additional territories.Despite the FDA’s approval of IMBRUVICATM, we cannot assure you or predict with any certainty that any other foreign regulatory authority will grant marketing approval for IMBRUVICATM, or the expected timeframe of any such approval. The review and potential approval of IMBRUVICATM carries many risks and uncertainties, and our regulatory submissions outside of the United States may not be satisfactory to the applicable regulatory authorities, including with regard to demonstrating adequate safety and efficacy for regulatory approval. We have made, and expect to make in the future, assumptions, estimations, calculations and decisions as part of our analyses of data and regulatory submissions, and the applicable regulatory authorities may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations, decisions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently.Furthermore, as was the case with FDA approval, other regulatory approvals, even if obtained, may be limited to specific indications, limit the type of patients in which the drug may be used, or otherwise require specific warning or labeling language, any of which might reduce the commercial potential of IMBRUVICATM. As with the FDA’s approval of IMBRUVICATM, regulatory authorities in other territories may condition IMBRUVICATM marketing approval on the conduct of specific post-marketing studies to further evaluate safety and efficacy, in either particular or general patient populations or both. The results of these studies, discovery of previously unknown issues involving safety or efficacy or failure to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, including requirements with respect to manufacturing practices, reporting of adverse 23effects, advertising, promotion and marketing, may result in restrictions on the marketing of IMBRUVICATM or the withdrawal of IMBRUVICATM from the market.We are subject to certain healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement that may impact the commercialization of IMBRUVICATM and our product candidates. Failure to comply with such laws, regulations and enforcement could subject us to significant fines and penalties and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to several healthcare regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, the viability of the corporation as a whole, and more specifically, the sales, marketing and education programs for IMBRUVICATM or any of our potential future product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale. The most significant healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement areas are as follows:•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, "HIPAA"), as amended by the Health Information for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;•the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;•federal False Claims Act which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;•the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use, and regulates the distribution of drug samples;•the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which among other things, prohibits bribery of non-US government (i.e., foreign) officials;•the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (codified into law in the California), which among other things, governs appropriate interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare professionals;•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; and•state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.Additionally, the compliance environment is changing, with more states, such as California and Massachusetts, mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other states, such as Vermont, District of Columbia, and Minnesota limiting the provision of and/or requiring reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals. Moreover, Section 6002 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, includes new requirements for pharmaceuticals manufacturers, among others, to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in PPACA, including reporting any payment or “transfer of value” made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year. Section 6002 of PPACA includes in its reporting requirements a broad range of transfers of value (such as, for example, consulting fees, charitable contributions, payments for research, and grants) and excludes a transfer of anything the value of which is less than $10, unless the aggregate amount of such transfers of value to a recipient exceeds $100 annually. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the final rule implementing Section 6002 of PPACA. Under the rule, drug manufacturers are required to track payments or transfers of value to recipients beginning on August 1, 2013, and annually report payments, transfers for value, and investments interests beginning on March 31, 2014. Under the rule, with our product approval on November 13, 2013 for MCL, we will commence data capture from May 12, 2014, 6 months from product registration, for reporting by March 31, 2015. Several states currently have similar laws and more states may enact similar legislation. Reporting and potential public disclosure of these expenses may make it more difficult to recruit physicians for assistance with activities that would be helpful to our business. Tracking and reporting the required expenses may result in considerable expense and additional resources.24If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.Current health care laws and regulations, including the recently enacted health care reform, as well as future legislative or regulatory changes to the healthcare system, may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.In the United States, there has been recent legislation, as well as legislative and regulatory proposals, changing the healthcare system in ways that may affect our future revenue and profitability, and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners, and the availability of capital. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system and, in particular, that are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services.The most significant recent health care legislation is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the “Healthcare Reform Act”, which President Obama signed into law in March 2010. This law substantially changes how health care is funded by the state and federal government as well as private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Though the full effect of the Healthcare Reform Act on pharmaceutical companies has yet to be seen, the changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, new governmental programs, and fraud and abuse enforcements. The Healthcare Reform Act takes effect in stages through 2018.Certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Act are likely to adversely affect pharmaceutical manufacturers in particular. For example, in 2011, the Healthcare Reform Act imposed non-deductible annual flat fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers based upon relative market share. Furthermore, as part of the Healthcare Reform Act closing a funding gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, certain pharmaceutical manufacturers will be required to provide a 50% discount on drugs dispensed to beneficiaries within this funding gap.There also have been and likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the state and federal levels that could bring about significant changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program and other federal pharmaceutical pricing and rebate programs. Given these and other recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, federal and state lawmakers will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These efforts could adversely affect our business by, among other possibilities, limiting the prices that can be charged for drugs we develop or the amount of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, limiting the profits that pharmaceutical companies may earn on certain sales, increasing the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies, increasing our rebate liability, or limiting our commercial opportunity. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any legislation or regulations that may be adopted in the future. Any cost containment measures and other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.We may need to adjust our business practices to comply with evolving health care fraud and abuse regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs.The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General ("OIG") to issue a series of regulations, known as the "safe harbors." These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the 25OIG. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as "qui tam" actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, sometimes known as "relators" or, more commonly, as "whistleblowers," may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim action. In addition, under current case law of the federal courts, the False Claims Act prohibits as a false claim any claim for payment submitted to or paid by the federal government for utilization of a prescription drug consequent to off-label promotion of the drug in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA). When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim, and face exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health programs. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.Even though we have obtained approval to market IMBRUVICATM in the United States, we are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and review, including post-approval requirements that could result in the withdrawal of IMBRUVICATM from the market. IMBRUVICATM was approved for treating patients with MCL and for patients with CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review for drugs that may offer significant improvement in treatment or provide treatment where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists. Even though we have obtained approval to market IMBRUVICATM in the United States, we are subject to extensive ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements and the requirement to have our promotional materials pre-cleared by the FDA. There may also be additional FDA post-marketing obligations, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize IMBRUVICATM in the United States or potentially other jurisdictions.We and the manufacturers of IMBRUVICATM are also required to comply with cGMP regulations which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture IMBRUVICATM. In addition, regulatory agencies subject an approved product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer’s facilities to continual review and inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with IMBRUVICATM, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where IMBRUVICATM is manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of IMBRUVICATM, up to and including withdrawal of IMBRUVICATM from the market. If our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such noncompliance could result in regulatory action and additional costs to us. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:•issuance of Form 483 notices or Warning Letters by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;•imposition of fines and other civil penalties;•criminal prosecutions;26•injunctions, suspensions or revocations of regulatory approvals;•suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;•total or partial suspension of manufacturing;•delays in commercialization;•refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;•refusals to permit drugs to be imported into or exported from the United States;•restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and•product recalls or seizures.The policies of the FDA and other regulatory agencies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of IMBRUVICATM in other indications or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or Janssen might not be permitted to market IMBRUVICATM and our business would suffer.If any promotional activities that we undertake fail to comply with the regulations and guidelines of the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory agencies, we may be subject to warnings or enforcement actions that could harm our business. Physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling or for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use. Companies cannot actively promote approved drugs for off-label uses but may in some jurisdictions and under specified conditions disseminate articles published in peer-reviewed journals that discuss off-label uses of approved products to physicians. To the extent allowed, we may in the future disseminate peer-reviewed articles on our products to physicians. If our promotional activities for IMBRUVICATM and any other potential future product candidate for which we may receive regulatory approval fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement by, these authorities.Our failure to establish, manage and maintain a distribution network could delay or compromise the commercialization of IMBRUVICATM.We do not have the infrastructure necessary for distributing IMBRUVICATM to patients. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse IMBRUVICATM and distribute it to wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, and other drug suppliers that ultimately distribute IMBRUVICATM directly to patients. Our third-party logistics company will also provide billing, collection and returns services. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, finance, regulatory and medical affairs teams.Failure to maintain our contracts with our third-party logistics company, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals or other drug suppliers, or the inability or failure of any of them to adequately perform under the contracts, could negatively impact the distribution of IMBRUVICATM. Failure to coordinate financial systems could also negatively impact our ability to accurately report and forecast product revenue. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, sales of IMBRUVICATM could be severely compromised and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.We may need substantial additional financing and we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future.We have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds for the commercialization, manufacturing, marketing and sales of IMBRUVICATM and to complete the research, development and clinical testing of investigational uses of IMBRUVICATM and additional products. We may be unable to entirely fund these efforts with our current financial resources. We may also raise from time to time additional funds through the public or private sale of securities, bank debt, collaborations or otherwise. If we are unable to secure additional funds, whether through additional partnership collaborations, bank debt financings, or sale of our securities, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs. Based upon the current status of our product development plans, we believe that our cash, cash 27equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. We may, however, choose to raise additional funds before then. Our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the level of sales of IMBRUVICATM;•the timing of marketing authorization of any of our additional products granted by the FDA or other regulatory authority;•the timing of market launch of any of our additional products after grant of marketing authorization by the FDA or other regulatory agency;•the speed of market uptake and the timing and extent of demand for any of our additional products after grant of marketing authorization by the FDA or other regulatory agency;•continued progress of our research and development programs;•progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials;•the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval;•our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with third parties;•the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims;•the amount and timing of capital equipment purchases; and•competing technological and market developments.We also expect to raise any necessary additional funds through the public or private sale of securities, bank debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources that may be highly dilutive, or otherwise disadvantageous, to existing stockholders or subject us to restrictive covenants. In addition, in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources, such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. Additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms may require us to reduce our costs and expenses, delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements and to continue operations. Any one of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could adversely affect our business.The manufacture and marketing of our products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous government authorities in the United States and abroad. Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we are required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that the product is safe and effective for the patient population and for the diseases that will be treated. Clinical trials, and the manufacturing and marketing of products, are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing, manufacture, labeling, advertising, distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices. As a result, clinical trials and regulatory approval can take a number of years to accomplish and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals.In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. We may encounter similar delays in foreign countries. Our trials may be placed on clinical hold or otherwise suspended and we may be unable to complete such trials. Additionally, we may be unable to obtain requisite approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities and even if obtained, such approvals may not be received on a timely basis, or they may not cover the clinical uses that we specify.Furthermore, regulatory approval may entail ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. The manufacture and marketing of drugs are subject to continuing FDA and foreign regulatory review and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Any of the following events, if they were to occur, could delay or preclude us from further developing, marketing or realizing full commercial use of our products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:28•failure to obtain and thereafter maintain requisite governmental approvals;•failure to obtain approvals for specific indications of our products under development;•an occurrence of serious and unanticipated adverse side effects;•identification of serious and unanticipated long-term adverse side effects in our products under development, that may not have been identified prior to approval; or•identification of previously unknown problems with the manufacturing or manufacturing processes for our products.The FDA granted approval for IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of patients with MCL and for the treatment of patients with CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy. The regulatory approval is limited in that patients with MCL/CLL who in each case have not received any prior therapy, or treatment-naïve patients, are not included in the approved indication for IMBRUVICATM. This limitation prevents us and Janssen from marketing IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of any such treatment-naïve patients. Any future regulatory approval that we receive for a product candidate may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, extensive requirements apply to the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion of IMBRUVICATM and any future product candidates that may receive approval from the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies. We and the manufacturers of our product candidates must also comply with the applicable FDA Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP") regulations, which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies, including unannounced inspections, and must achieve an acceptable inspection outcome before they can be used in commercial manufacturing of our products. We or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable GMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure of our suppliers to follow current GMP practice or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial or clinical use and could subject us to fines, injunctions and civil penalties.Although Breakthrough Therapy Designations for IMBRUVICATM monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, IMBRUVICATM monotherapy for the treatment of patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), and IMBRUVICATM monotherapy for the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL characterized by deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (deletion 17p) were previously granted, and although FDA subsequently granted a marketing approval for IMBRUVICATM in the treatment of MCL and in the treatment of CLL, there is no guarantee that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the WM indication or the CLL/SLL with deletion 17P indication or any other potential indications for IMBRUVICATM will lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process or increase the likelihood that IMBRUVICATM will receive marketing approval for the WM indication, the CLL/SLL with deletion 17P indication or any other potential indications.If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development, the FDA may grant a Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Marketing applications filed with the FDA by sponsors of products with a Breakthrough Therapy Designation are intended to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of such drugs, but the Breakthrough Therapy Designation does not assure any such qualification or ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. The previous receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the development of IMBRUVICATM monotherapy for the treatment of patients with MCL, IMBRUVICATM monotherapy for the treatment of patients with WM, and IMBRUVICATM monotherapy for the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL characterized by deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (deletion 17p) and the FDA’s subsequent grant of marketing approval of IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of patients with MCL or for the treatment of patients with CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, neither guarantees that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the WM indication or the CLL/SLL with deletion 17P indication will result in a faster development process, review or approval for such indications nor increases the likelihood that IMBRUVICATM will be granted marketing approval for the WM indication or the CLL/SLL with deletion 17P indication. Likewise, any future Breakthrough Therapy Designation for any other potential indication of IMBRUVICATM neither guarantees a faster development process, review or approval nor improves the likelihood of the grant of marketing approval by FDA for any such potential indication of IMBRUVICATM compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw any Breakthrough Therapy Designation at any time. We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for other of our product candidates, but the FDA may not grant this status to any of our proposed product candidates.If we are unable to successfully develop and test our drug candidates, we may not be successful.The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, if any, to develop and 29commercialize our drug candidates, including IMBRUVICATM for indications other than those approved by the FDA, successfully. Our drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for sale. To satisfy these standards, we and/or our collaborators must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. Despite our efforts, our drug candidates may:•cause, or may appear to have caused, serious adverse side effects (including death) or potentially dangerous drug interactions;•have dose limiting toxicities;•not show signs of efficacy in any disease as a single agent or in combination, or may only work in combination with other drugs;•cause resistance in patients that may diminish the clinical benefit; •not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive drugs; or•not be proven safe and effective in clinical trials.The strength of our pipeline of drug candidates and potential drug candidates will depend in large part upon the outcomes of our ongoing and planned Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Findings, including toxicology findings, in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials as well as results of our clinical trials could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program, including development of IMBRUVICATM for indications other than those approved by the FDA. Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.We and many other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, the results from the completed preclinical studies and clinical trials, positive results in preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later−stage trials or of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale. In addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials, including our BTK program and its effects on various types of cancers. Interim data are subject to change, and there can be no assurances that interim data will be confirmed upon the analysis of final data.Serious adverse events may force us to limit or discontinue any of our drug development and commercialization programs. Our ability to develop and commercialize any of our drug candidates or products may be adversely impacted by any serious adverse events that patients may experience when treated with our drug candidate or product. The initial safety profile of IMBRUVICATM is established with very limited patient safety data with the US approval. No contraindication has been identified to date. Adverse events included hemorrhage, infection, myelosuppression (blood cells decreases), renal failure, second primary malignancies and atrial fibrillation were reported. Severe bleeding events, including such events affecting the gastrointestinal tract or the central nervous system, have been reported in patients exposed to IMBRUVICATM. Common infection includes upper respiratory infection and pneumonia. For myelosuppression, low white counts, low red cell counts and low platelet counts have been reported. Other primary malignancies, including skin cancers and other cancers have also been reported in patients exposed to IMBRUVICATM. Renal failure has also been reported with patients in MCL. Cardiac arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation has been reported. Limited safety data is available with these initial open label clinical trials and all of the AE are included regardless if they are related to the drug or not. Although we have a monitoring plan in place should these events occur and although they are generally managed by withdrawal of IMBRUVICATM therapy, we cannot guarantee that events or the occurrence of new unexpected serious safety signal will not cause us to cease development of IMBRUVICATM or withdraw the product from the market following any grant of marketing authorization by the FDA or other regulatory authority.We may not be successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for IMBRUVICATM in other indications and we cannot be certain that any of our products under development will be commercialized.In addition to successfully launching IMBRUVICATM for patients with MCL and CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, to achieve sustained profitability, we must successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of IMBRUVICATM in other indications. Likewise, we must successfully research, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and distribute the other products we have under development. The time frame necessary to achieve these goals for any individual product is long and uncertain. Before we can sell any of our products under development, we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and regulatory authorities in foreign markets through the 30submission of nonclinical (animal) studies and clinical (human) trials that each product is safe and effective for human use for each targeted disease. We have conducted and plan to continue to conduct extensive and costly clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of our potential products. We cannot be certain that we will be permitted to begin or continue our planned clinical trials for our potential products, or if permitted, that our potential products will prove to be safe and produce their intended effects.The completion rate of our clinical trials depends upon, among other factors, the rate of patient enrollment, the adequacy of patient follow-up and the completion of required clinical evaluations. Many factors affect patient enrollment, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, competing clinical trials and new drugs or procedures used for the conditions we are investigating. Other companies are conducting clinical trials and have announced plans for future trials that are seeking or are likely to seek patients with the same diseases that we are studying. We may experience delays in reaching planned level of patient enrollment in our clinical trials. Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs, and delays or termination of clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Many factors can affect the adequacy of patient follow-up and completion of required clinical evaluations, including failure of patients to return for scheduled visits or failure of clinical sites to complete necessary documentation. Delays in or failure to obtain required clinical follow-up and completion of clinical evaluations could also have a material adverse effect on the timing and outcome of our clinical trials and product approvals.Additionally, clinical trials require substantial administration and monitoring. We may fail to effectively oversee and monitor the various trials we have underway at any particular time, which would result in increased costs or delays of our clinical trials or compromise our ability to obtain product approvals.Data already obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products under development do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later preclinical studies and clinical trials. Moreover, data from clinical trials we are conducting are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product under development could limit or prevent regulatory approval of the potential product and would materially harm our business. Our clinical trials may not demonstrate the sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approval or may not result in marketable products.We have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to have losses in the future, until such time, if ever, as the commercialization of our products generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses.We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 1991 and we expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses until such time, if ever, as the sale of IMBRUVICATM or the commercialization of our products generates sufficient revenue to cover our expenses. The FDA approved IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of patients with MCL and for the treatment of patients with CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, in the United States. We commercially launched IMBRUVICATM on November 13, 2013 for MCL and on February 12, 2014 for CLL. In connection with the commercial launch of IMBRUVICATM and the NDA filing, we incurred substantial expenses.We began generating commercial product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013, however the commercial product revenue generated to date is not sufficient to cover our expenses. Our sustaining profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to successfully commercialize IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of patients with MCL and CLL, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates including IMBRUVICATM for other indications, and to obtain required regulatory approvals and to successfully manufacture and market our proposed products.We may fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to third-party patents.Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and defend our proprietary technology and product candidates through patents and trade secret protection. We, therefore, aggressively pursue, prosecute, protect and defend patent applications, issued patents, trade secrets, and licensed patent and trade secret rights covering certain aspects of our technology. The evaluation of the patentability of United States and foreign patent applications can take years to complete and can involve considerable expense and uncertainty.We have a number of patents and patent applications related to our compounds but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will issue as patents. Even if patents are issued and maintained, these patents may not be of adequate scope to benefit us, or may be held invalid and unenforceable against third parties. In addition, if we breach our agreements with our licensors and do not cure such breaches, we may lose rights under patents and other intellectual property licensed to us. Moreover, if our agreement with Celera is terminated by 31Celera under certain circumstances, our rights in our intellectual property acquired from Celera, including that related to IMBRUVICATM, would revert to Celera and we would lose our right to commercialize such intellectual property.We face risks and uncertainties related to our intellectual property rights. For example:•we may be unable to obtain or maintain patent or other intellectual property protection for any products or processes that we may develop;•third parties may obtain patents covering the manufacture, use or sale of these products, which may prevent us from commercializing IMBRUVICATM or any of our products under development globally or in certain regions; and•any future patents that we may obtain may not prevent other companies from competing with us by designing their products or conducting their activities so as to avoid the coverage of our patents.The actual protection afforded by a patent varies depending on the product candidate and country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents under existing and future laws. Our ability to maintain or enhance our proprietary position for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Due to the extensive amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary rights and information, including the use of confidentiality and other agreements with our employees and consultants, and in our academic and commercial relationships, these steps may be inadequate, these agreements may be violated, or there may be no adequate remedy available for a violation. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Furthermore, our trade secrets may become known to our competitors even in the absence of any violation of our rights. Our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. We may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in unpatented proprietary technology.Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing future products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. We own patents that claim the active pharmaceutical ingredient of IMBRUVICATM as a chemical entity. However, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which they may use to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing IMBRUVICATM or any of our patented product candidates. If these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from selling IMBRUVICATM or any of our other products unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. If any license is needed it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. For example, we are aware of a third party patent application that contains claims covering a method of treating malignancies using a certain class of compounds that may encompass certain of our products, including IMBRUVICATM. In the event that such claims are included in a patent granted on such patent application, we could be prevented from commercializing any such products for the treatment of malignancies unless we obtain sufficient rights under such patent from the patent owner or successfully challenge the validity and/or enforceability of such patent. Patents in the United States issue with a presumption of validity and enforceability and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any such challenge would be successful.Furthermore, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.We are dependent on our collaboration agreement with Janssen to further develop and commercialize IMBRUVICATM globally. The failure to maintain this agreement or the failure of Janssen to perform its obligations under this agreement, could negatively impact our business.32Pursuant to the terms of our collaboration and licensing agreement with Janssen, we granted Janssen a license to co-develop (with us) IMBRUVICATM, our BTK Inhibitor, globally, to co-commercialize it (with us) in the United States, and to exclusively commercialize it outside of the United States, in each case for all non-immunology related indications. Under a global development plan, each party will be responsible for conducting certain clinical trials. The collaboration and license agreement includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated development activities. Except in certain cases, in general Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of development costs and we are responsible for the remaining 40% of development costs. The agreement also provides that pre-tax profits or pre-tax losses from the commercialization of any products resulting from the collaboration are shared 50% by us and 50% by Janssen.The collaboration with Janssen provides us with an annual cap of our share of collaboration costs and pre-tax commercialization losses for each calendar year until the third profitable calendar quarter for the product, as determined in the agreement. In the event that our share of aggregate development costs in any given calendar year, together with any other amounts that become due from us, plus our share of pre-tax loss (if any) for any calendar quarter in such calendar year, less our share of pre-tax profit (if any) for any calendar quarter in such calendar year, exceeds $50,000,000, then amounts that are in excess of $50,000,000 (the "Excess Amounts") are funded by Janssen. Under the Agreement, total Excess Amounts plus interest may not exceed $225,000,000. As of December 31, 2013, total Excess Amounts of $134,968,000 (which comprises the cumulative amount funded by Janssen to-date of $134,261,000 and interest of $707,000) would become payable once we reach a third profitable calendar quarter for the product. Further, Excess Amounts shall be reimbursable only from our share of pre-tax profits (if any) after the third profitable calendar quarter for the product. We cannot reasonably predict the amount and timing of potential future commitments under the Janssen collaboration and license agreement, including Excess Amounts, as the payments are contingent upon future events. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our collaboration and licensing agreement with Janssen.We have limited control over the development or commercialization costs incurred by Janssen, and limited control over the implementation of development and commercial activities performed by them. Our costs and revenue are therefore tied to efforts made by ourselves and Janssen in developing and marketing our product. We have limited control over the amount of time and effort Janssen will devote to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of IMBRUVICATM, and very limited control over the manner in which Janssen conducts its business with regard to obtaining regulatory and other approvals and commercializing the product, especially outside the United States. Accordingly, our revenue and financial position may be adversely affected if Janssen does not dedicate sufficient time to the development and commercialization of IMBRUVICATM, fails to obtain regulatory approvals, or otherwise fails to comply with its obligations under the agreement.We are subject to a number of other risks associated with our dependence on our collaboration and license agreement with Janssen, including:•We and Janssen could disagree as to future development plans and Janssen may delay future clinical trials or stop a future clinical trial;•There may be disputes between us and Janssen, including disagreements regarding the collaboration and license agreement, that may result in (1) the delay of or failure to achieve regulatory and commercial objectives that would result in additional milestone or profit share payments, (2) the delay or termination of any future development or commercialization of IMBRUVICATM, and/or (3) costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management's attention and resources;•Janssen may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding supply forecasts, which could adversely impact our ability to comply with our supply obligations to Janssen and manage our own inventory of IMBRUVICATM, as well as our ability to generate accurate financial forecasts;•Business combinations or significant changes in Janssen's business strategy may adversely affect Janssen's ability or willingness to perform its obligations under our collaboration agreement;•If Janssen is unsuccessful in performing clinical trials, or in obtaining regulatory approvals for or commercializing IMBRUVICATM outside the U.S., we may not receive certain additional milestone payments or any profit payments under the collaboration and license agreement and our business prospects and financial results may be materially harmed;•Janssen may not comply with applicable regulatory requirements or guidelines with respect to developing or commercializing IMBRUVICATM, which could adversely impact future development or sales of IMBRUVICATM globally.The collaboration and license agreement is subject to early termination, including through Janssen's right to terminate without cause upon advance notice to us. If the agreement is terminated early, we may not be able to find another collaborator for the further development and commercialization of IMBRUVICATM on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be unable to pursue continued development and commercialization of IMBRUVICATM on our own.33If our collaboration is unsuccessful or is terminated by Janssen, we might not effectively develop and market IMBRUVICATM.Integral to the success of our collaboration with Janssen is our ability to timely achieve certain milestones and obtain regulatory approvals. Our collaboration with Janssen may be unsuccessful. Under the terms of our agreement, Janssen may terminate its agreement with us without cause and upon short notice. Termination of our agreement would hinder our efforts to effectively develop and commercialize IMBRUVICATM. There could be a delay in getting our product to market. Such delay could likely result in higher costs for us and could adversely affect any progress we have made in clinical trials.We may have difficulty finding another collaboration partner on favorable terms if Janssen terminates our agreement. We might not be able to raise capital on our own.We rely heavily on third parties for research, pre-clinical development and clinical development of our products.We currently depend heavily and will continue to depend heavily in the future on third parties for support in research, pre-clinical development and clinical development of our products. The termination of a significant number of our existing collaborative arrangements, or our inability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical development of our products. Given our limited resources, it may be necessary to establish partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies that have greater financial and technical resources in order to successfully develop and commercialize our products. Although we have entered into a global strategic alliance with Servier related to the research, development, and commercialization of abexinostat (formerly known as PCI-24781), there is no assurance that any additional collaborations can be entered into, and if entered into, such collaborations may require us to relinquish product rights that could affect the financial success of these products.We engage clinical investigators and medical institutions to enroll subjects in our clinical trials and contract clinical research organizations, or CROs, for various aspects of our clinical development activities including clinical trial monitoring, data collection, safety monitoring and data management. As a result, we have had and continue to have less control over the conduct of clinical trials, the timing and completion of the trials, the required reporting of adverse events and the management of data developed through the trial than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Although we rely on CROs to conduct some of our clinical trials, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.Outside parties may have staffing difficulties, may undergo changes in priorities or may become financially distressed, adversely affecting their willingness or ability to conduct our trials. We may experience unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Any failure of such CROs to successfully accomplish clinical trial monitoring, data collection, safety monitoring and data management and the other services they provide for us in a timely manner and in compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical development of our products and obtain regulatory approval. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a CRO may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternate service provider. However, making such changes may be costly and may delay our trials, and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible. Additionally, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct our trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost.We lack the resources, capability and experience necessary to manufacture pharmaceuticals for clinical development or for commercial sale and thus rely heavily upon contract manufacturers.We have no manufacturing facilities and we currently rely on third parties for manufacturing and storage activities related to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals for our clinical trials or for commercial sale of IMBRUVICATM. Our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks:•delays in scale-up to quantities needed for multiple clinical trials, or failure to manufacture such quantities to our specifications, or deliver such quantities on the dates we require, could cause delay or suspension of clinical trials, regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products;•there is no guarantee that the supply of clinical materials can be maintained during the clinical development of our product candidates;•our current and future manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies for compliance with strictly enforced GMP and similar standards in other countries. 34Failure to achieve an acceptable inspection outcome could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our products to support our operations;•if we need to change to other commercial manufacturing contractors, there is no guarantee that we will be able to locate a suitable replacement contractor. These contractors must achieve an acceptable inspection outcome by the FDA and comparable foreign regulators prior to our use. The new manufacturers would have to demonstrate substantially equivalent processes for the production of our products;•our current manufacturers might not be able to fulfill our commercial needs, which would require us to seek new manufacturing arrangements and may result in substantial delays in meeting market demand;•any disruption of the ability of our manufacturing contractors to supply necessary quantities of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to support our operations; and•our current manufacturers may have insufficient capacity to support our requirements in the event of an increase in market demand.Any of these factors could delay clinical trials or commercialization of our products under development and entail higher costs.If we are unable to maintain or enter into agreements with suppliers or our suppliers fail to supply us with the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, for our drugs, we may experience delays in commercializing our drugs.We currently have supply agreements for PCI-32765, the API used in IMBRUVICATM. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these supply agreements or obtaining new supply agreements on reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for these suppliers in a timely manner or at all.We anticipate that we will rely on a single manufacturing and supply chain for IMBRUVICATM for the foreseeable future. Any production shortfall on the part of our suppliers that impairs the supply of IMBRUVICATM could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of this compound, there could be a substantial delay in successfully developing a second source of supply. An inability to continue to source product from our only manufacturing and supply chain, which could be due to regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for IMBRUVICATM, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially, which could significantly harm our business.We rely on sole source suppliers and face risk of harm caused by hazardous materials used in the manufacturing of our products.The manufacturing processes for our products involve the use of hazardous, volatile and flammable materials capable of igniting and/or exploding if not handled properly. Although our manufacturing processes incorporate safety procedures designed to prevent or avoid the creation of conditions under which the materials could ignite and/or explode, we cannot be certain that such safety procedures will be followed or if followed will be adequate to mitigate or eliminate the risk of harm caused by fire and/or explosion during the manufacturing of any of our products. Any such event may incapacitate the manufacturing capability of any of our contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). We have no assurance that we will avoid liability for harm caused by any such event. If we are found liable for damages or agree to pay damages in settlement of a claim against us for any harm caused by any such event, our insurance coverage may be inadequate or may not cover part or all of such damages. In addition, we do not have an alternate or back-up supply chain for the manufacturing and supply of any of our products. If such an event causes us to lose the operational capacity of any manufacturing element in the supply chain for any of our products, our ability to manufacture and supply the product will be substantially impaired or prevented, and we may be unable to supply enough product to support our development and/or commercialization programs, which may force us to curtail or discontinue our business operations.We may be unsuccessful in developing, training and managing our Sales and Marketing organizations. The FDA approved IMBRUVICATM for the treatment of patients with MCL on November 13, 2013 and for the treatment of patients with CLL on February 12, 2014, who in each case have received at least one prior therapy. Prior to the approval, we hired and trained sales representatives for our U.S. territories. While we believe our Sales and Marketing organizations have the technical expertise and experience that will be required for the marketing of IMBRUVICATM in the U.S., we have not previously operated a sales and marketing organization. We have and will incur substantial additional expenses in developing, training and managing such an organization. The cost of developing, training and managing our sales force may exceed any product revenue. In addition, our own marketing and sales efforts may be unsuccessful. We compete with many other 35companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete successfully against those of such other companies. Although we have a co-promotion and licensing arrangement with our partner Janssen for the marketing of IMBRUVICATM in the U.S., this relationship may fail to increase the commercial success of IMBRUVICATM. If Janssen terminates its relationship with us, we may decide to enter into a co-promotion or other licensing arrangement with another large pharmaceutical or biotechnology firm in order to commercialize IMBRUVICATM. To the extent we rely on our existing co-promotion and licensing arrangement with our partner Janssen or enter into a co-promotion or other licensing agreement with another large pharmaceutical or biotechnology firm, some or all of the revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and may not be within our control. If we are unable to retain our existing co-promotion and licensing arrangement with our partner Janssen or we are unable to enter into a co-promotion or other licensing agreement with another large pharmaceutical or biotechnology firm on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize IMBRUVICATM or our future product candidates. If we are not successful in commercializing IMBRUVICATM or our future product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant losses or become unable to continue the operation of our business.If we lose or are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, then we may not be able to develop our products or processes and obtain the required regulatory approvals.We are highly dependent on qualified scientific and management personnel. We will need to expand and effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, development and other resources in order to successfully pursue our research, development and commercialization efforts for our existing product and for existing and future product candidates. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and personnel with sales, marketing, medical affairs, regulatory, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical experience. We will need to hire additional personnel as we continue to expand our research and development, partnering activities and commercialization efforts.We face intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Francisco, California area. We are highly dependent on our senior executives. If any of our senior executives were to terminate his or her position with us, or we were to lose an additional senior executive officer, any of our senior scientists, a manager of one of our programs, or a significant number of any of our staff or we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, then our ability to develop and commercialize our products and processes, raise additional capital or implement our business strategy may be adversely affected or rendered impractical and our business may be harmed as a result.Our business is subject to risks associated with international operations and collaborations.The laws of foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In countries where we do not have and/or have not applied for patents on our products, we will be unable to prevent others from developing or selling similar products. In addition, in jurisdictions outside the United States where we acquire patent rights, we may be unable to prevent unlicensed parties from selling or importing products or technologies derived elsewhere using our patented technology.Until we or our licensees obtain the required regulatory approvals for pharmaceuticals in any specific foreign country, we or our licensees will be unable to sell these products in that country. International regulatory authorities have imposed numerous and varying regulatory requirements and the approval procedures can involve additional testing. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by any other regulatory authority.Forecasting sales of IMBRUVICATM may be difficult and revenue recognition may be deferred. If our revenue projections are inaccurate or revenue is deferred and our business forecasting and planning decisions are not reflected in our actual results, our business may be harmed and our future prospects may be adversely affected. Our management must make forecasting decisions regarding future revenue in the course of business planning despite the uncertainty of revenue projection. Our actual results of operations may deviate materially from projected results. This may lead to inefficiencies and increased difficulties in operational planning. If our revenues from IMBRUVICATM sales are lower than we anticipate or revenue is deferred, we will incur costs in the short term that will result in losses that are unavoidable. A shortfall in our revenue would have a direct impact on our cash flow and on our business generally. In addition, fluctuations in our quarterly results can adversely and significantly affect the market price of our common stock. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.36Our income tax obligations are based on our corporate operating structure, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the scope of our international operations. The tax laws applicable to our international business activities, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and our positions that defer or avoid the recognition of revenue from and taxation of intercompany technology transfer transactions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially affect our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.The current administration has made public statements indicating that it has made international tax reform a priority, and key members of the U.S. Congress have conducted hearings and proposed a wide variety of potential changes. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States, could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the United States. Due to the expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.All of our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. We conduct some transactions in foreign currencies, primarily related to ex-U.S. clinical trial and manufacturing activities, and we expect to continue to do so. We have not entered into any agreements or transactions for currency exchange to hedge the risk associated with potential fluctuations in currencies; accordingly, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to these ex-U.S. clinical trial and manufacturing activities. While we may enter into hedge or other agreements in the future to actively manage this risk, we do not believe this risk is material to our financial statements.We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that our employees or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these or other claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may face injunctions that restrict or preclude our access to important markets, intellectual property, or personnel. Any restriction or loss of access to markets, intellectual property, research personnel or work product that are key to our operations could hamper or negate our ability to commercialize our existing product or certain potential drugs, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.We may be subject to damages or injunctions resulting from employment discrimination or harassment claims that our employees or former employees bring against us.Although we have developed and implemented a program for compliance with federal and state civil rights laws and employment laws, including laws prohibiting any harassment or discrimination in the hiring, promotion, firing, or treatment of employees on the basis of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious denomination, pregnancy status, other classification, or any retaliation against employees for engaging in protected activity, we cannot guarantee that our compliance program will be sufficient or effective, that our employees will comply with our policies, that our employees will notify us of any violation of our policies, that we will 37have the ability to take appropriate and timely corrective action in response to any such violation, or that we will make decisions and take actions that will necessarily limit or avoid liability with respect to any employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation claim our employees may bring against us, including any claim under the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1991 (as amended), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), as amended, Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Acts of 1866, the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (as amended) ("ADEA"), the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, the Employee Retirement Income and Securities Act ("ERISA", the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"), the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, California Business and Professions Code 17200, any and all protections pursuant to California's Labor Code or the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), Section 806 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and any federal or state constitutional rights and protections. Discrimination, harassment or retaliation claims brought by employees or former employees against their employers or former employers have increased substantially in recent years. In addition, the enactment of new federal and state laws, the amendment of existing federal and state laws, and the interpretation of existing or future laws by court decision could further expand the grounds on which employees and former employees may pursue claims of employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation. We cannot adequately predict whether our compliance program will effectively protect us from liability under present or future federal or state laws against employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation. If one or more of our employees brings a claim of employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation against us and if we are found liable for damages and/or an injunction is imposed on us or we agree to pay damages and/or accept an injunction in settlement of the claim, the payment of the damages amount or the curtailment of our activities consequent to the injunction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and impair or prevent us from continuing our business.We may be subject to damages or injunctions resulting from qui tam or “whistleblower” actions that our employees or former employees bring against us.Although we have developed and implemented a program for compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that our compliance program will be sufficient or effective, that our employees will comply with our policies, that our employees will notify us of any violation of our policies, that we will have the ability to take appropriate and timely corrective action in response to any such violation, or that we will make decisions and take actions that will necessarily limit or avoid liability for qui tam or federal “whistleblower” claims that our employees or former employees may bring against us or that governmental authorities may prosecute against us based on information provided by our employees or former employees. Qui tam or “whistleblower” claims against employers brought by employees or former employees or governmental authorities based on information from employees or former employees have increased substantially in recent years. In any qui tam or “whistleblower” action that results in the payment of a fine imposed by a court or a settlement, the employee or former employee who brought the claim or furnished information allowing the governmental authority to prosecute the claim is rewarded with a percentage of the fine or settlement amount collected from the employer. The prospect of sharing in the proceeds of any fine collected from the employer motivates employees and former employees to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” claims or to furnish information to a governmental authority for the prosecution of such claims. In addition, the enactment of new federal and state laws, the amendment of existing federal and state laws, and the interpretation of existing or future laws by court decision could further expand the grounds on which employees and former employees may pursue qui tam or “whistleblower” claims. We cannot adequately predict whether our compliance program will effectively protect us from liability under present or future federal or state laws relating to qui tam or “whistleblower” claims that our employees or former employees may bring against us or that governmental authorities may prosecute against us on the basis of information provided by our employees or former employees. If one or more of our employees brings a qui tam or “whistleblower” claim against us or if a governmental authority prosecutes a claim against us on the basis of information provided by one or more of our employees or former employees, and if we are found liable and a fine and/or an injunction is imposed on us or we agree to pay a fine and/or accept an injunction in settlement of the claim, the payment of the fine and/or the curtailment of our activities consequent to the injunction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and impair or prevent us from continuing our business.Our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.We invest funds in excess of those needed for working capital and costs and expenses in marketable securities which may include corporate notes, certificates of deposit, government securities and other financial instruments. Significant declines in the value of these investments due to the operating performance of the companies we invest in or general economic or market conditions may result in the recognition of realized or impairment losses which could be material.38We may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy reporting requirements.As a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404, and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Compliance with Section 404 and other requirements will increase our costs and require additional management resources. We may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy reporting requirements. While we were able to complete an unqualified assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, there is no assurance that future assessments of the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting will be unqualified. If we are unable to obtain future unqualified reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our stock price.Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations.The development, manufacturing, pricing, sales, coverage and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and other authorities within the United States and numerous entities outside of the United States. While we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program, which adheres to: (1) the requirements set forth by the OIG in OIG’s Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, as codified into law in California, (2) the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals as codified into law in California, and (3) other applicable healthcare compliance laws and regulations, and is largely based on what we believe are the current pharmaceutical industry best practices, we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of potentially applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these laws and regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, including suspension or termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of products from the market, significant fines, disqualification or debarment from participation in federally-funded health care programs or other sanctions or litigation, any of which events may have a significant adverse impact on our business.Our facility in California is located near an earthquake fault, and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters or resource shortages could disrupt our operations and adversely affect results.Important documents and records, such as hard copies of our laboratory books and records for our drug candidates and compounds, are located in our corporate headquarters at a single location in Sunnyvale, California, which is near active earthquake zones. We do not have a formal business continuity or disaster recovery plan, and could therefore experience a significant business interruption in the event of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, drought or flood, or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems. In addition, California from time to time has experienced shortages of water, electric power and natural gas. Future shortages and conservation measures could disrupt our operations and cause expense, thus adversely affecting our business and financial results.Risks Related to Our Common StockIf our results do not meet our and analysts' forecasts and expectations, our stock price could decline.Analysts who cover our business and operations provide valuations regarding our stock price and make recommendations whether to buy, hold or sell our stock. Our stock price may be dependent upon such valuations and recommendations. Analysts' valuations and recommendations are based primarily on our reported results and our and their forecasts and expectations concerning our future results regarding, for example, expenses, revenues, clinical trials, regulatory marketing approvals and competition. Our future results are subject to substantial uncertainty, and we may fail to meet or exceed our and analysts' forecasts and expectations as a result of a number of factors, including those discussed under the section entitled “Risks Related to Pharmacyclics” above. If our results do not meet our and analysts' forecasts and expectations, our stock price could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and recommendations or otherwise.Future equity issuances or a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.Because we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue to expand our business and our research and development activities, among other things, we may conduct additional equity offerings. If we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of options and warrants) in the public 39market, the market price of our common stock could fall. A decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.If our officers, directors and largest stockholders choose to act together, they are able to control our management and operations, acting in their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders and their affiliates collectively have the ability to determine the election of all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. They may exercise this ability in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control.Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. In addition, provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders. These provisions are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value. However, these prohibitions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price.The price of our common stock is volatile.The market prices for securities of biotechnology companies, including ours, have historically been highly volatile. Our stock, like that of many other companies, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations sometimes unrelated to operating performance. For example, during the period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2013, the sales price for one share of our common stock reached a high closing price of $139.89 per share and a low closing price of $4.88 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including:•the commercial success of IMBRUVICATM and the revenues we generate;•the progress and results of our preclinical testing, clinical trials, product development and partnering activities;•quarterly fluctuations in our financial results;•the development of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us, our competitors or others;•changes in governmental regulation;•the success or failure of our efforts to obtain marketing authorization for any of our products from the FDA or other regulatory authority;•our ability to satisfy regulatory requirements for the maintenance of any marketing authorization granted by FDA or other regulatory authority for any of our products;•the emergence of drug safety issues that require us to add restrictions or warnings to the label or withdraw from the market any of our products after approval by the FDA or other regulatory authority;•developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us, our competitors or others;•developments and/or announcements by us, our competitors or others;•litigation;•public concern as to the safety of products developed by us, our competitors or others;•departure of key personnel;•ability to manufacture our products to commercial standards;•changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems and the coverage and reimbursement policies of governmental and other third-party payers;•our ability to successfully commercialize our products if they are approved;•comments by securities analysts; and•general market conditions in our industry.40In addition, if any of the risks described in this section entitled “Risk Factors” actually occur, there could be a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.Risks Related to Our IndustryWe face rapid technological change and intense competition.The pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Therapies designed by other companies to treat the conditions that are the focus of our products are currently in clinical trials. Developments by others may render our products under development or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, sales, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors' financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources. In addition, we may experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire technology from universities and other research institutions. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary positions that compete with our products. We are engaged in the development of novel therapeutic technologies. Our resources are limited and we may experience technical challenges inherent in such novel technologies.Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects than our products. Our competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective or less costly than our products and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to our product offerings. Our competitors may price their products below ours, may receive better coverage and/or reimbursement or may have products that are more cost effective than ours.The widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of IMBRUVICATM and any of our additional products even if commercialized. The diseases for which we are developing our therapeutic products can also be treated, in the case of cancer, by surgery, radiation, biologics and chemotherapy. These treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. The established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for widespread acceptance of IMBRUVICATM and any of our additional products even if commercialized. We may be unable to demonstrate any pharmacoeconomic advantage for our products compared to established or standard-of-care therapies for our target patient populations. In addition, many of our target patient populations can present with indolent, or slowly progressing, disease. It may be difficult for us to show that treatment with our products provides a significant improvement in clinical outcome compared to the avoidance of treatment, or watching for the progression of disease, in such patients. Payers may decide that the potential improvement our products provide to clinical outcomes in our target patient populations is not adequate to justify the costs of treatment with our products. If payers do not view our products as offering a better balance between clinical benefit and treatment cost compared to standard-of-care therapies, the profitability of our products may be severely reduced.If our products are not accepted by the market or if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and other third-party payers, our revenue and profitability may suffer.Our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in significant part on the extent to which appropriate coverage of and reimbursement for our products and related treatments are obtained from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We cannot provide any assurances that third- party payers will consider our products cost-effective or provide coverage of and reimbursement for our products, in whole or in part.Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved medical products and services and newly approved indications for existing products. Third-party payers may conclude that our products are less safe, less clinically effective, or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payers may not approve our products for coverage and reimbursement. If we are unable to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them. Such reduction or limitation in use of our products could cause our sales to suffer. Even if third-party payers make reimbursement available, payment levels may not be sufficient to make the sale of our products profitable.Also, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of medical services and products, may result in inadequate 41coverage of and reimbursement for our products. Many third-party payers, including in particular HMOs, are pursuing various ways to reduce pharmaceutical costs, including, for instance, the use of formularies. The market for our products depends on access to such formularies, which are lists of medications for which third-party payers provide reimbursement. These formularies are increasingly restricted, and pharmaceutical companies face significant competition in their efforts to place and obtained preferred positioning for their products on formularies of HMOs and other third-party payers. This increased competition has led to a downward pricing pressure in the industry. The cost containment measures that third-party payers are instituting could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.Our business exposes us to product liability claims.The testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of our products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us. We face the risk that the use of our products when sold to patients and when used in human clinical trials will result in adverse effects. IMBRUVICATM is currently marked, and if we complete clinical testing for our additional products and receive regulatory approval to market such additional products, we will mark our additional products, with warnings that identify the known potential adverse effects and the patients who should not receive our product. We cannot ensure that physicians and patients will comply with these warnings. In addition, unexpected adverse effects may occur even with use of our products that have received approval for commercial sale. Although we are insured against such risks in connection with clinical trials and commercial activities, our present product liability insurance may be inadequate. A successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms. In addition, product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products. A product liability claim or recall would have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business involves environmental risks.In connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials and products, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.
