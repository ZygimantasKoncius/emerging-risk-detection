ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our Company involves various risks, including the risk that an investor might lose its entire investment. The following discussion concerns some of the risks associated with our business. These risks are interrelated and should be considered collectively. The risks described below are not the only risks that may affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not identified below, may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our security holders. Risks Related to Our Business and Properties Real estate investments are inherently risky, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. If we acquire or develop properties and they do not generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet operating expenses, including debt service, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to our security holders will be materially adversely affected. Income from properties may be adversely affected by, among other things,:  downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly in the greater Washington D.C. region, where our properties are located);  declines in the financial condition of our tenants (including tenant bankruptcies) and our ability to collect rents from our tenants;  decreases in rent and/or occupancy rates due to competition, oversupply or other factors;  increases in operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums, site maintenance (including snow removal costs, which have been higher in recent years) and utilities;  vacancies and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space, or significant capital expenditures;  reduced capital investment in or demand for real estate in the future;  costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions and laws;  terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;  decreases in the underlying value of our real estate;  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; and  changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing real estate usage, zoning and taxes. We significantly increased the size of our portfolio during 2010 and may continue to meaningfully grow our portfolio, and newly developed and acquired properties may initially be dilutive and/or may not produce the returns that we expect, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects. During 2010, we focused our efforts on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of business parks and industrial and office properties, and we significantly increased the size of our portfolio. We intend to continue to acquire and develop additional business park and industrial and office properties, and the size of our portfolio could meaningfully increase even further. These acquisitions may be initially dilutive to our net income. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. We have acquired, and may continue to acquire, properties not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property until the property is more fully leased at favorable rental rates. If our estimated return on investment for the property proves to be inaccurate and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we expected in originally analyzing the investment (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating costs), thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations. This risk may be particularly pronounced for properties placed into development or acquired shortly before the recent economic downturn, where we estimated occupancy and rental rates without the benefit of knowing how those assumptions might be impacted by the changing economic conditions that followed. 10 Table of Contents In addition, when we acquire certain properties that are significantly under-leased, we often plan to reposition or redevelop them with the goal of increasing profitability. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping such properties may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. If one or more of these new properties do not perform as expected, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisition and we may not be able to adapt our management and operational systems (including leasing and property management) to successfully integrate new properties into our portfolio without unanticipated disruption or expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisition, and we significantly increased the size of our portfolio during 2010. The size of our portfolio could meaningfully increase further, as we execute our business plan. As we increase the size of our portfolio, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate new properties into our portfolio or manage any future acquisitions of properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. In particular, because we have begun acquiring large, multi-tenant office properties, we cannot assure you that our leasing and property management functions will successfully and efficiently lease and operate such properties. Our acquisitions of properties will generate additional operating expenses that we will be required to pay. Our past growth has required, and our growth will continue to require, increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which could cause our operating margins to decline from historical levels, especially in the absence of revenue growth. As we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including tenant retention and mortgage default. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our portfolio and manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have limited experience in owning, developing and operating large, multi-tenant office properties, particularly in downtown Washington, D.C., which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During 2010, we acquired four multi-story office buildings, including one through an unconsolidated joint venture, located in downtown Washington D.C. comprising approximately 0.5 million square feet of gross leasable area. These office properties have the capacity to support multiple tenants. Prior to 2010, our portfolio was comprised principally of business parks and industrial properties and smaller office properties located outside of downtown Washington, D.C. We have very limited experience in owning, developing, leasing and operating large, multi-tenant office properties that require, among other things, additional leasing and property management capability. We cannot assure you that managements past experience will be sufficient to successfully own, develop, lease, manage and operate such office properties (or additional office properties that we may acquire in the future), particularly in the downtown Washington, D.C. market where we have limited operating experience, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If current adverse global market and economic conditions worsen or do not fully recover, our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Overall financial market and economic conditions have been challenging in recent years, beginning with the credit crisis and a recession in 2008. Challenging economic conditions persisted throughout 2010 and have continued to some degree into 2011. These conditions, which could continue, combined with the ongoing difficult financial conditions still being faced by numerous financial institutions, high unemployment and residential and commercial real estate markets that are slow to recover, among other things, have contributed to ongoing market volatility and uncertain expectations for the U.S. and other economies. As a result of these conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected in the markets in which we own properties and we and our tenants conduct operations. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of numerous financial institutions specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, to provide funding to borrowers, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants and our lenders. If these conditions do not fully recover, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our tenants, to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in material adverse effects on our and our tenants financial condition and results of operations. In particular, if our tenants businesses or ability to obtain financing deteriorates further, they may be unable to pay rent to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. 11 Table of Contents In addition, our access to funds under our revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facility to meet their funding commitment to us. We cannot assure you that continuing long-term disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures of, third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions, will not have an adverse effect on our lenders. If our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitment to us, our business, results of operation, cash flow and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. We cannot predict the duration or severity of the current economic challenges, and it these conditions worsen or do not fully recover, our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to access adequate cash to fund our business or growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our business requires access to adequate cash to finance our operations, distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, development and redevelopment costs and property acquisition costs, if any. We expect to generate the cash to be used for these purposes primarily with operating cash flow, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, proceeds from sales of strategically identified assets and potential joint ventures and, when market conditions permit, through the issuance of debt and equity securities from time to time. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund our business, particularly if we are unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire according to expectations. This risk may be even more pronounced given the ongoing challenging economic conditions being faced by some of our tenants. Moreover, we rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms, in the time period we desire, or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:  general market conditions;  the markets view of the quality of our assets;  the markets perception of our growth potential;  our current debt levels;  our current and expected future earnings;  our cash flow and cash distributions; and  the market price per share of our common stock. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our principal and interest obligations or make the distributions to our shareholders. We are subject to the credit risk of our tenants, who may declare bankruptcy or otherwise fail to make lease payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. We are subject to the credit risk of our tenants. We cannot assure you that our tenants will not default on their leases and fail to make rental payments to us. In particular, the recent global recession and disruptions in the financial and credit markets, local economic conditions and other factors affecting the industries in which our tenants operate may affect our tenants ability to obtain financing to operate their businesses or continue to profitability execute their business plans. This, in turn, may cause our tenants to be unable to meet their financial obligations, including making rental payments to us, which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency. A tenant in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rent and interest during the bankruptcy proceeding and may reject the lease. In the event of the tenants breach of its obligations to us or its rejection of the lease in bankruptcy proceedings, we may be unable to locate a replacement tenant in a timely manner or on comparable or better terms. The loss of rental revenues from any of our larger tenants, a number of our smaller tenants or any combination thereof, combined with our inability to replace such tenants on a timely basis may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. 12 Table of Contents A majority of our tenants hold leases covering less than 10,000 square feet. Many of these tenants are small companies with nominal net worth, and therefore may be challenged in operating their businesses during economic downturns. In addition, certain of our properties are, and may be in the future be, substantially leased to a single tenant and, therefore, such propertys operating performance and our ability to service the propertys debt is particularly exposed to the economic condition of the tenant. The loss of rental revenues from any of our larger tenants or a number of our smaller tenants may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Loss of the U.S. Government as a tenant could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow, and could cause an impairment of the value of some of our properties. The U.S. Government accounted for 11% of our total annualized rental revenue as of December 31, 2010, and the U.S. Government combined with government contractors accounted for over 20% of our total annualized rental revenue as of December 31, 2010. Some of our leases with the U.S. Government are for relatively short terms or provide for early termination rights, including termination for convenience or in the event of a budget shortfall. Further, on July 31, 2003, the United States Department of Defense issued the Unified Facilities Criteria (the UFC), which establish minimum antiterrorism standards for the design and construction of new and existing buildings leased by the departments and agencies of the Department of Defense. The loss of the federal government as a tenant resulting from our inability to comply with the UFC standards or for any other reason, including pursuant to the governments contractual termination rights or significant reductions in federal government spending, or the loss of a future significant tenant would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could cause the value of our affected properties to be impaired. A reduction or elimination of rent from the U.S. Government or other significant tenants would also materially reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our security holders. We may be unable to renew expiring leases or re-lease vacant space on a timely basis or on attractive terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Approximately 14% of our annualized base rent is scheduled to expire in 2011, and approximately 8% of our annualized base rent is scheduled to expire during 2012. Current tenants may not renew their leases upon the expiration of their terms. Alternatively, current tenants may attempt to terminate their leases prior to the expiration of their current terms. For example, as discussed in the risk factor above, our leases with the U.S. Government include favorable tenant termination provisions. If non-renewals or terminations occur, we may not be able to locate qualified replacement tenants (particularly in light of the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the U.S.) and, as a result, we could lose a significant source of revenue while remaining responsible for the payment of our financial obligations. Moreover, the terms of a renewal or new lease, including the amount of rent, may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms, or we may be forced to provide tenant improvements at our expense or provide other concessions or additional services to maintain or attract tenants. Any of these factors could cause a decline in lease revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Our debt level may have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and our ability to pursue growth through acquisitions and development projects. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $725 million of outstanding indebtednesses, consisting principally of our mortgage debt, convertible notes, senior unsecured notes, terms loans and amounts outstanding under our credit facility. In connection with our acquisition and development activity, we significantly increased our debt during 2010. We will incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with, among other things, our acquisition, development and operating activities. Our use of debt financing creates risks, including risks that:  our cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;  we will be unable to refinance some or all of our indebtedness or that any refinancing will not be on terms as favorable as those of the existing indebtedness;  required debt payments will not be reduced if the economic performance of any property declines;  debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our security holders and funds available for acquisitions;  most of our secured debt obligations require the lender to be made whole to the extent we decide to pay off the debt prior to the maturity date;  any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure; and  certain defaults under our mortgage loan documents or other indebtedness could cause a default under, and the acceleration of payments related to, certain of our indebtedness, including as of December 31, 2010 our Senior Series A and Series B Notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $75 million, our unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate outstanding amount of $191 million, our secured term loans in the aggregate outstanding amount of $110 million, and our Exchangeable Senior Notes in an aggregate outstanding amount of $30.5 million. 13 Table of Contents If the economic performance of any of our properties declines, our ability to make debt service payments would be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, we may lose that property to lender foreclosure with a resulting loss of income and asset value. In addition, under the covenants of our unsecured revolving credit facility, secured term loans and senior notes, we have certain restrictions on the amount of debt we are allowed to incur and such covenants otherwise place restrictions on our operations (including, among other things, requirements to maintain specified coverage ratios and other financial covenants, and limitations on our ability to make dividends, enter into joint ventures, develop properties and engage in certain business combination transactions), which could limit our ability to execute our business plan and would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Our leverage levels may make it difficult to obtain additional financing based on our current portfolio or to refinance existing debt on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain additional financing could impede our ability to grow and develop our business through, among other things, acquisitions and developments. Our leverage levels also may adversely affect the market price of our securities if an investment in our Company is perceived to be more risky than an investment in our peers. Furthermore, the restrictions placed on our business pursuant to the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue some business initiatives or effect certain transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our company. We may be required to repay or refinance a portion of our mortgage indebtedness prior to its maturity date, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations Certain of our subsidiaries are borrowers on mortgage indebtedness, the terms of which prohibit certain direct or indirect transfers of ownership interests in the borrower subsidiary (a Prohibited Transfer). Under the terms of the mortgage loan documents, a lender could assert that a Prohibited Transfer includes the trading of our common shares on the NYSE, the issuance of common shares by us, or the issuance of units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership. As of December 31, 2010, we believe that there were eleven mortgage loans with such Prohibited Transfer provisions, representing an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately $112 million. Two of these mortgage loans were entered into prior to our initial public offering (IPO) in 2003 and nine were assumed subsequent to our IPO. In January 2011, the Company repaid, with available cash, a $12.0 million mortgage with a Prohibited Transfer provision that was assumed subsequent to its IPO. In addition, in January 2011, the Company agreed to a modification of a $22.1 million mortgage loan to expressly permit such trading and issuances. In each instance, we received the consent of the mortgage lender to consummate our IPO (for the two pre-IPO loans) or to acquire the property or the ownership interests of the borrower (for the post-IPO loans), including the assumption by our subsidiary of the mortgage loan. Generally, the underlying mortgage documents, previously applicable to a privately held owner, were not changed at the time of the IPO or the later loan assumptions, although we believe that each of the lenders or servicers was aware that the borrowers ultimate parent was or would become a publicly traded company. Subsequent to the IPO and the assumption of these additional mortgage loans, the Company has issued new common shares and shares of the Company have been transferred on the NYSE. Similarly, our operating partnership has issued units of limited partnership interest. To date, no lender or servicer has asserted that a Prohibited Transfer has occurred as a result of any such transfer of shares or units of limited partnership interest. However, we can provide no assurance that, in the future, a mortgage lender would not seek to assert that a Prohibited Transfer has occurred and to seek to accelerate the amounts due under the mortgage loan and demand immediate repayment. In such event, we believe that we have strong defenses to any such claims and would vigorously defend against any such action. Nonetheless, if a lender were to be successful in any such action, we could be required to immediately repay or refinance the amounts outstanding, or the lender may be able to foreclose on the property securing the loan or take other adverse actions. In addition, in certain cases a Prohibited Transfer could result in the loan becoming full recourse to us or our operating partnership. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance one or more mortgage loans on favorable terms or at all if it were to be successfully accelerated by the lender(s) thereof, which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as described above in the risk factor entitled Our debt level may have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and our ability to pursue growth through acquisitions and development projects, if a violation of a Prohibited Transfer provision were to occur that would permit our mortgage lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them, it could result in an event of default under our Senior Unsecured Series A and Series B Notes, our unsecured revolving credit facility, our two secured term loans and our Exchangeable Senior Notes. 14 Table of Contents Our variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk. We have an unsecured revolving credit facility, secured term loans in an aggregate amount of $110.0 million and certain other debt, some of which is unhedged, that bears interest at a variable rate. As of December 31, 2010, we had $301.0 million of variable rate debt, none of which, was hedged through interest rate swap agreements. In July 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, beginning on January 18, 2011, fixed LIBOR at 1.474% on $50.0 million of the our variable rate debt. The interest rate swap will mature on January 15, 2014. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, if not hedged properly or at all, which would adversely affect net earnings and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to our security holders. For example, if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010 increased by 1%, or 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense on our existing variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flow by approximately $3.0 million annually. We have and may continue to engage in hedging transactions, which can limit our gains and increase exposure to losses. We have and may continue to enter into hedging transactions to attempt to protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt, or in some cases, prior to a proposed debt issuance. Our hedging transactions may include entering into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap or floor agreements, or other interest rate exchange contracts. Hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. No hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because, among other things:  available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection;  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability;  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay;  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and  the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value. Downward adjustments, or mark-to-market losses, would reduce our equity. Hedging involves risk and typically involves costs, including transaction costs that may reduce our overall returns on our investments. These costs increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. These costs will also limit the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders. We generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions. REIT qualification rules may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by, among other things, requiring us to limit our income from hedges. If we are unable to hedge effectively because of the REIT rules, we will face greater interest rate exposure. We compete with other parties for tenants and property acquisitions. Our business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisition. The commercial real estate industry is highly competitive, and we compete with substantially larger companies, including substantially larger REITs and institutional investment funds, for the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. As a result, we may not be able or have the opportunity to make suitable investments on favorable terms in the future, which may impede our growth and/or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, competition for acquisitions make require us to, among other things, make concessions to sellers and/or agree to higher non-refundable deposits, which could require us to agree to acquisition terms less favorable to us. We also face significant competition for tenants in our properties from owners and operators of business park and industrial and office properties who may be more willing to make space available to prospective tenants at lower prices than comparable spaces in our properties, especially in difficult economic times. Thus, competition could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 15 Table of Contents All of our properties are located in the greater Washington D.C. region, making us vulnerable to changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions in that region that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. All of our properties are located in the greater Washington D.C. region, exposing us to greater risks than if we owned properties in multiple geographic regions. Economic conditions in the greater Washington D.C. region may significantly affect the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. A decline in occupancy and rental rates, in turn, may significantly affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations. There can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow or that favorable economic conditions will exist. Further, the economic condition of the region may also depend on one or more industries and, therefore, an economic downturn in one of these industry sectors may adversely affect our performance. For example, the U.S. Government, which has a large presence in our markets, accounted for 11% of our total annualized rental revenue as of December 31, 2010, and the U.S. Government combined with government contractors accounted for over 20% of our total annualized rental revenue as of December 31, 2010. We are therefore directly affected by decreases in federal government spending (either directly through the potential loss of a U.S. Government tenant or indirectly if the businesses of tenants that contract with the U.S. Government are negatively impacted). In addition to economic conditions, we may also be subject to changes in the regions regulatory environment (such as increases in real estate and other taxes, costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation and other factors) or other adverse conditions or events (such as natural disasters). Thus, adverse developments and/or conditions in the greater Washington D.C. region could reduce demand for space, impact the credit-worthiness of our tenants or force our tenants to curtail operations, which could impair their ability to meet their rent obligations to us and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Development and construction risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects. Our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities may subject us to the following risks:  we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects;  we may incur construction costs for a property that exceeds our original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that we did not anticipate;  we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities; and  we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for a significant cash return. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our shareholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects. Failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth and/or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may make selected acquisitions outside our current geographic market from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise. Our historical experience is in the greater Washington D.C. region, and we may not be able to operate successfully in other market areas where we have limited or no experience. We may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets. These risks include, among others:  a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economies;  an inability to identify promising acquisition or development opportunities;  an inability to identify and cultivate relationships that, similar to our relationships in the greater Washington D.C. region, are important to successfully effecting our business plan;  an inability to employ construction trades people; and  a lack of familiarity with local government and permitting procedures. 16 Table of Contents Any of these factors could adversely affect the profitability of projects outside our current markets and limit the success of our acquisition and development strategy. If our acquisition and development strategy is negatively affected, our growth may be impeded and our results of operations materially adversely affected. In addition, during 2010 we entered the downtown Washington, D.C. market in connection with our acquisition of a number of downtown Washington, D.C. real estate assets. See We have limited experience in owning, developing and operating large, multi-tenant office properties, particularly in downtown Washington, D.C., which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, above. We have no previous experience with owning and operating properties in downtown Washington, D.C., which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have limited experience in engaging in lending activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During 2010, we structured an investment in a Washington, D.C. office property in the form of a $25 million loan to the owners of the property, which is secured by a portion of the equity interests in the entities that own the underlying real estate, bears interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum, is interest only and matures on April 1, 2017. This loan is effectively subordinate to a senior mortgage loan on the property. We may engage in additional lending activities in the future, including mezzanine financing activities. These types of loans involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements between the holder of the mortgage loan and us, as the mezzanine lender, may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our investment, which could result in losses. In addition, even if we are able to foreclose on the underlying collateral following a default on a mezzanine loan, we would be substituted for the defaulting borrower and, to the extent income generated on the underlying property is insufficient to meet outstanding debt obligations on the property, may need to commit substantial additional capital to stabilize the property and prevent additional defaults to lenders with existing liens on the property. Significant losses related to mezzanine loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Under some of our leases, tenants have the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Some of our leases for our current properties provide tenants with the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease. If a tenant terminates its lease with us prior to the expiration of the term, we may be unable to re-lease that space on as favorable terms, or at all, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. This risk may be more pronounced with respect to our U.S Government tenants. See Loss of the U.S. Government as a tenant could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow, and could cause an impairment of the value of some of our properties, above. Property owned through joint ventures, or in limited liability companies and partnerships in which we are not the sole equity holder, may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interests. We have, and may in the future, make investments through partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures, some of which may be significant in size. In particular, during 2010 and thus far in 2011, we have entered a number of joint ventures in connection with our acquisition and development of various real estate assets. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve various risks, including the following:  our partners, co-members or joint ventures might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining general partners or joint ventures would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership or joint venture);  our partners, co-members or joint ventures might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals;  our partners, co-members or joint ventures may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and  agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint ventures, members or partners interest or buy-sell or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms. 17 Table of Contents Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions with respect to, and the market price of, our securities. Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to adverse changes in the performance of such properties may be limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:  adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions;  changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;  changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;  the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older buildings;  changes in operating expenses; and  civil unrest, acts of war and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Moreover, the REIT rules governing property sales and agreements that we may enter into with joint venture partners or contributors to our operating partnership not to sell certain properties for a period of time may interfere with our ability to dispose of properties on a timely basis without incurring significant additional costs. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. We may also acquire properties that are subject to a mortgage loan that may limit our ability to sell the properties prior to the loans maturity. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow as well as our ability to make distributions to our security holders. Liabilities under environmental laws for contamination may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to liability created under, existing or future federal, state, or local environmental laws and regulations for contamination. An owner or operator of real property can face strict, joint and several liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances, including petroleum-based products at, on, under or from the property. Similarly, a former owner or operator of real property can face the same liability for the disposal of hazardous substances that occurred during the time of ownership or operation. We may face liability regardless of:  our lack of knowledge of the contamination;  the extent of the contamination; 18 Table of Contents  the timing of the release of the contamination; or  whether or not we caused the contamination. Environmental liability for contamination may include the following, without limitation: investigation and feasibility study costs, remediation costs, litigation costs, oversight costs, monitoring costs, institutional control costs, penalties from state and federal agencies, and third-party claims. Moreover, operations on-site may be required to be suspended until certain environmental contamination is remediated and/or permits are received and environmental laws can impose permanent restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used depending on the extent and nature of the contamination. This may result in a default of the terms of the lease entered into with our tenants. Environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances at, on, under or from a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property or borrow using the property as collateral, thus harming our financial condition. There may be environmental liabilities associated with our properties of which we are unaware. For example, some of our properties contain, or may have contained in the past, underground tanks for the storage of hazardous substances, petroleum-based or waste products, or some of our properties have been used, or may have been used, historically to conduct industrial operations, and any of these circumstances could create a potential for release of hazardous substances. Non-compliance with environmental laws at our properties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our properties are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws. Non-compliance with these environmental laws could subject us or our tenants to liability and changes in these laws could increase the potential costs of compliance or increase liability for noncompliance. Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenants activities on the property, we could nonetheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest for environmental liabilities created by our tenants, and we cannot be sure that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreement or lease. Moreover, these environmental liabilities could affect our tenants ability to make rental payments to us. Non-compliance with environmental laws at our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. Liabilities arising from the presence of hazardous building materials at our properties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. For example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or ACM. Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. These requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to ACM or releases of ACM into the environment. The Companys properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects, property damage, or remediation costs. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses, and bacteria. Concern about indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants, including mold, has been increasing as exposure to these airborne contaminants have been alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or to increase ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, and others if property damage or health concerns arise. 19 Table of Contents Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that materially adversely impact our cash flow. All of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities, but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the U.S. Government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. While the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under our leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to security holders. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our security holders. An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policies on our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Under the terms and conditions of most of the leases currently in force on our properties our tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenants expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and full replacement value property damage insurance policies. However, our largest tenant, the federal government, is not required to maintain property insurance at all. We have obtained comprehensive liability, casualty, flood and rental loss insurance policies on our properties. All of these policies may, depending on the nature of the loss, involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions. In addition, we cannot assure you that our tenants will properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles. Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which our securities trade, the markets in which we operate, our business and our results of operations. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our business and our results of operations. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs. In particular, we may be directly exposed in Washington, D.C., a large metropolitan area that has been, or may be in the future, a target of actual or threatened terrorism attacks. The terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks. In addition, certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others would not be covered by our current terrorism insurance. Additional terrorism insurance may not be available at a reasonable price or at all. If the properties in which we invest are unable to obtain sufficient and affordable insurance coverage, the value of those investments could decline, and in the event of an uninsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of an investment. The United States may enter into armed conflicts in the future. The consequences of any armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. Any of these events could result in increased volatility in or damage to the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in a continuation of the current economic uncertainty in the United States or abroad. Adverse economic conditions could affect the ability of our tenants to pay rent, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our security holders, and may adversely affect and/or result in volatility in the market price for our securities. 20 Table of Contents We face risks associated with our tenants being designated Prohibited Persons by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or OFAC, maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned, or Prohibited Persons. OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons. Certain of our loan and other agreements may require us to comply with these OFAC requirements. If a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the OFAC list, we may be required by the OFAC requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful. Our properties may suffer from air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic and other reactions. If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. Such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the propertys tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property. In addition, these conditions could expose us to liability from our tenants and others if property damage occurs or health concerns arise. Rising energy costs may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Electricity and natural gas, the most common sources of energy used by commercial buildings, are subject to significant price volatility. In recent years, energy costs, including energy generated by natural gas and electricity, have fluctuated significantly. Some of our properties may be subject to leases that require our tenants to pay all utility costs while other leases may provide that tenants will reimburse us for utility costs in excess of a base year amount. It is possible that some or all of our tenants will not fulfill their lease obligations and reimburse us for their share of any significant energy rate increases and that we will not be able to retain or replace our tenants if energy price fluctuations continue. Also, to the extent under a lease we agree to pay for such costs, rising energy prices will have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure Our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits in the event of a change in control of our Company or if their employment agreement is terminated without cause or not renewed, which could prevent or deter a change in control of our Company. We have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, Douglas J. Donatelli, Nicholas R. Smith, Barry H. Bass, James H. Dawson and Joel F. Bonder, that provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends under certain circumstances following a change in control of our Company, terminated without cause, or if the executive officer resigns for good reason as defined in the employment agreements. These benefits could increase the cost to a potential acquirer of our Company and thereby prevent or deter a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the interests of our security holders. We may experience conflicts of interest with several members of our board of trustees and our executive officers relating to their ownership of units of our Operating Partnership. Some of our trustees and executive officers may have conflicting duties because, in their capacities as our trustees and executive officers, they have a duty to our Company, and in our capacity as general partner of our Operating Partnership, they have a fiduciary duty to the limited partners, and some of them are themselves limited partners and own a significant number of units of limited partner interest in our Operating Partnership. These conflicts of interest could lead to decisions that are not in your best interest. Conflicts may arise when the interests of our shareholders and the limited partners of our Operating Partnership diverge, particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the limited partners, such as upon the sale of assets or the repayment of indebtedness. 21 Table of Contents We depend on key personnel, particularly Mr. Douglas J. Donatelli, with long-standing business relationships, the loss of whom could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully and have other negative implications under certain of our indebtedness. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of our senior management team, including Douglas J. Donatelli. In particular, the extent and nature of the relationships that Mr. Donatelli has developed in the real estate community in our markets is critically important to the success of our business. Although we have an employment agreement with Mr. Donatelli and other key executive officers, there is no guarantee that Mr. Donatelli or our other key executive officers will remain employed with us. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, particularly Mr. Donatelli, would harm our business and prospects. Further, loss of a member of our senior management team could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Further, the terms of certain of our debt instruments, including one of our term loans, includes a default provision whereby if any two of Douglas Donatelli, Nicholas Smith or Barry Bass, three of our executive officers, cease to maintain their current positions or duties at our company for any reason, a default under such debt could be triggered unless, within six months, our board has appointed a qualified substitute individual acceptable to the majority of the lenders in their sole discretion. One of our trustees may have conflicts of interest with our Company. One of our Companys trustees, Terry L. Stevens, currently serves as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Highwoods Properties, Inc., a fully integrated, North Carolina-based REIT that owns, leases, manages, develops and constructs office and retail properties, some of which are located in our target markets. As a result, conflicts may arise when we and Highwoods Properties, Inc. compete in the same markets for properties, tenants, personnel and other services. Our rights and the rights of our security holders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests. Maryland law generally provides that a trustee has no liability for actions taken as a trustee, but may not be relieved of any liability to the company or its security holders for actions taken in bad faith, with willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard for his or her duties. Our amended and restated declaration of trust authorizes us to indemnify, and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses to, our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. In addition, our declaration of trust limits the liability of our trustees and officers for money damages, except as otherwise prohibited by Maryland law or for liability resulting from:  actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or  a final judgment or other final adjudication based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated. As a result, we and our security holders may have more limited rights against our trustees than might otherwise exist. Our amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify each trustee or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of his or her service to us. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our trustees and officers. Our Series A Preferred Shares have, and future issuances of our preferred shares may have, terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us. In January 2011, we issued 4.6 million of our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Shares. Our Series A Preferred Shares have certain conversion and redemption features that could be triggered upon a change of control, which may make it more difficult for or discourage a party from taking over our company. In addition, our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue up to 50 million preferred shares, issuable in one or more classes or series. Our board of trustees may increase the number of preferred shares authorized by our declaration of trust without shareholder approval. Our board of trustees may also classify or reclassify any unissued preferred shares and establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote, to participate in earnings and to convert into securities) of any such preferred shares, which rights may be superior to those of our common shares. Thus, in addition to our Series A Preferred Shares, our board of trustees could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of the common shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common shares. 22 Table of Contents Our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities. To qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest may be owned, directly or under applicable attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined to include certain entities) during the last half of each taxable year (other than our first REIT taxable year). To preserve our REIT qualification, our declaration of trust generally prohibits direct or indirect beneficial ownership (as defined under the Code) by any person of (i) more than 8.75% of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or (ii) more than 8.75% of the value of our outstanding shares of all classes. In addition, pursuant to the Articles Supplementary setting forth the terms of our Series A Preferred Shares, no person may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our Series A Preferred Shares. Generally, shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limitation. Our declaration of trust has created a special higher ownership limitation of no more than 14.9% for the group comprised of Louis T. Donatelli, Douglas J. Donatelli and certain related persons. Unless the applicable ownership limitation is waived by our board of trustees prior to transfer, any transfer of our common shares that would violate the ownership limitation will be null and void, and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares. Common shares that would otherwise be held in violation of the ownership limit will be designated as shares-in-trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer or other event giving rise to such excess ownership. The beneficiary of the trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us. The ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or that such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. The ownership limitation provisions also may make our common shares an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain, either alone or with others as a group, ownership of (i) more than 8.75% of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or (ii) more than 8.75% in value of our outstanding shares of all classes. Our board of trustees may change our investment and operational policies and practices without a vote of our security holders, which limits your control of our policies and practices. Our major policies, including our policies and practices with respect to investments, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions, are determined by our board of trustees. Although we have no present intention to do so, our board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of our security holders. Accordingly, our security holders have limited control over changes in our policies. Our declaration of trust and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we or our Operating Partnership may incur. If we become highly leveraged, then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and harm our financial condition. Our declaration of trust contains provisions that make removal of our trustees difficult, which could make it difficult for our shareholders to effect changes to our management. Our declaration of trust provides that a trustee may be removed, with or without cause, only upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common shares. Vacancies may be filled by the board of trustees. This requirement makes it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing trustees. Our bylaws may only be amended by our board of trustees, which could limit your control of certain aspects of our corporate governance. Our board of trustees has the sole authority to amend our bylaws. Thus, the board is able to amend the bylaws in a way that may be detrimental to your interests. Maryland law may discourage a third party from acquiring us. Maryland law provides broad discretion to our board of trustees with respect to their duties as trustees in considering a change in control of our Company, including that our board is subject to no greater level of scrutiny in considering a change in control transaction than with respect to any other act by our board. 23 Table of Contents The Maryland Business Combination Act restricts mergers and other business combinations between our Company and an interested shareholder for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, and thereafter imposes special shareholder voting requirements on these combinations. An interested shareholder is defined as any person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our common shares and also includes any of our affiliates or associates that, at any time within the two year period prior to the date of a proposed merger or other business combination, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our voting power. Additionally, the control shares provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, are applicable to us as if we were a corporation. These provisions eliminate the voting rights of issued and outstanding shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares, as defined under the MGCL, unless our shareholders approve such voting rights by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares and shares held by our trustees and officers. Control shares are generally defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the shareholder, entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees. Our amended and restated declaration of trust and/or bylaws, provide that we are not bound by the Maryland Business Combination Act or the control share acquisition statute. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our board of trustees may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. We could also opt to make the Maryland Business Combination Act applicable to us by amending our declaration of trust by a vote of a majority of our outstanding common shares. Finally, the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the MGCL permit our board of trustees, without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that shareholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests. Tax Risks of our Business and Structure If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will not be able to deduct our distributions, and our income will be subject to taxation, which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our shareholders. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2003. The requirements for qualification as a REIT, however, are complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing REITs are limited. The REIT qualification rules are even more complicated for a REIT that invests through an operating partnership, in various joint ventures, in other REITs and in both equity and debt investments. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend on our ability to meet various requirements concerning, among other things, the ownership of our outstanding shares of stock, the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our shareholders. If we fail to meet these requirements and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our distributions to our shareholders will not be deductible by us and we will be subject to a corporate level tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, substantially reduce our cash available to make distributions to our shareholders. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a REIT, we would no longer be required to make distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Incurring corporate income tax liability might cause us to borrow funds, liquidate some of our investments or take other steps that could negatively affect our operating results. Moreover, if our REIT status is terminated because of our failure to meet a REIT qualification requirement or if we voluntarily revoke our election, unless relief provisions applicable to certain REIT qualification failures apply, we would be disqualified from electing treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which REIT status is lost. We may not qualify for relief provisions for REIT qualification failures and even if we can qualify for such relief, we may be required to make penalty payments, which could be significant in amount. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will be subject to any applicable state, local or foreign taxes and our taxable REIT subsidiaries are be subject to federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates. Failure of our operating partnership to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT. Failure of our operating partnership (or a subsidiary partnership) to be treated as a partnership would have serious adverse consequences to our shareholders. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the tax status of our operating partnership or any of its subsidiary partnerships for federal income tax purposes, our operating partnership or the affected subsidiary partnership would be taxable as a corporation. In such event, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, would cease to qualify as a REIT. 24 Table of Contents Distribution requirements relating to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes limit our flexibility in executing our business plan. Our business plan contemplates growth through acquisitions. To maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income each year. REIT taxable income is determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income. In addition, we are required to pay a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which actual distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of our undistributed taxable income required to be distributed from prior years. We have distributed, and intend to continue to distribute, to our shareholders all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income each year in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to eliminate all federal income tax liability at the REIT level and liability for the 4% nondeductible excise tax. Our distribution requirements limit our ability to accumulate capital for other business purposes, including funding acquisitions, debt maturities and capital expenditures. Thus, our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing. In addition, differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at REIT taxable income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds or make a taxable distribution of our shares or debt securities to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. Our disposal of properties may have negative implications, including unfavorable tax consequences. If we make a sale of a property directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity, for federal income tax purposes, and it is deemed to be a sale of dealer property or inventory, the sale may be deemed to be a prohibited transaction under the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs, in which case our gain, or our share of the gain, from the sale would be subject to a 100% penalty tax. If we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction, we may seek to conduct that sales activity through a taxable REIT subsidiary, in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the 100% prohibited transaction tax. We cannot assure you, however, that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity, for federal income tax purposes are sales of dealer property or inventory, in which case the 100% penalty tax would apply. Moreover, we have entered and may enter into agreements with joint venture partners or contributors to our operating partnership that require us to avoid taxable property sales and to maintain property-level indebtedness on contributed properties for a period of years. Sales of properties or repayment of indebtedness may result in adverse consequences to our partners for which we may have full or partial indemnification obligations. We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our securities. At any time, the federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our shareholders, as the well as the market price of our securities, could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. We may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own shares, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive. We may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and our common shares at the election of each shareholder. Under IRS Revenue Procedures 2009-15 and 2010-12, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend for 2009, 2010 and 2011 could be payable in our shares. Taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, if the market value of our shares decreases following the distribution. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in shares. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our common shares in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares. 25 Table of Contents Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. The maximum tax rate applicable to income from qualified dividends payable to U.S. shareholders taxed at individual rates has been reduced by legislation to 15% through the end of 2012. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the market price of the stock of REITs, including our common shares. Complying with REIT requirements may force us to sell otherwise attractive investments. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy certain requirements with respect to the character of our assets. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter (by, possibly, selling assets notwithstanding their prospects as an investment) to avoid losing our REIT status. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, and the failure exceeds a de minimis threshold, we may be able to preserve our REIT status if (a) the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, (b) we dispose of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identified the failure, (c) we file a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service describing each asset that caused the failure, and (d) we pay an additional tax of the greater of $50,000 or the product of the highest applicable tax rate multiplied by the net income generated on those assets. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. If we or our predecessor entity failed to qualify as an S corporation for any of our tax years prior to our initial public offering, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we may not have at the close of any year undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year, including undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year for which we or our predecessor, First Potomac Realty Investment Trust, Inc., did not qualify as an S corporation. Although we believe that we and our predecessor corporation qualified as an S corporation for federal income tax purposes for all tax years prior to our initial public offering, if it is determined that we did not so qualify, we will not qualify as a REIT. Any such failure to qualify may also prevent us from qualifying as a REIT for any of the following four tax years. If First Potomac Management, Inc. failed to qualify as an S corporation during any of its tax years, we may be responsible for any entity level taxes due. We believe First Potomac Management, Inc. qualified as an S corporation for federal and state income tax purposes from the time of its incorporation in 1997 through the date it merged into our Company in 2006. However, the Company may be responsible for any entity-level taxes imposed on First Potomac Management, Inc. if it did not qualify as an S corporation at any time prior to the merger. First Potomac Management, Inc.s former shareholders have severally indemnified us against any such loss; however, in the event one or more of its former shareholders is unable to fulfill its indemnification obligation, we may not be reimbursed for a portion of the taxes. Risks Related to an Investment in Our Equity Securities Our common and preferred shares trade in a limited market which could hinder your ability to sell our common or preferred shares. Our common shares experience relatively limited trading volume; many investors, particularly institutions, may not be interested (or be permitted) in owning our common shares because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common shares at one time. This illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common shares as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of common shares having a limited market, thereby making our common shares a less attractive investment for some investors. In addition, an active trading market on the NYSE for our Series A Preferred Shares issued in January 2011 (which were our first issuance of preferred shares) may not develop or, if it does develop, may not last, in which case the trading price of our Series A Preferred Shares could be adversely affected. If an active trading market does develop on the NYSE, our Series A Preferred Shares may trade at prices lower than the initial offering price. 26 Table of Contents The market price and trading volume of our common and preferred shares may be volatile. The market price of our common shares has been and is likely to continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common and preferred shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Common and preferred share prices for REITs have experienced significant downward pressure in recent years in connection with the disruptions in the real estate and credit markets and the current economic downturn and may continue to experience such downward pressures in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common and preferred shares include:  actual or anticipated declines in our quarterly operating results or distributions;  reductions in our funds from operations;  declining occupancy rates or increased tenant defaults;  general market and economic conditions, including continued volatility in the financial and credit markets;  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our securities to demand a higher dividend yield;  changes in market valuations of similar companies;  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future;  additions or departures of key management personnel;  actions by institutional shareholders;  our issuance of additional debt or preferred equity securities;  speculation in the press or investment community; and  unanticipated charges due to the vesting of equity based compensation awards upon achievement of certain performance measures that cause our operating results to decline or fail to meet market expectations. Broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our common or preferred shares. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies that have been unrelated to these companies operating performances. These broad market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common or preferred shares, regardless of our operating performance. Furthermore, our operating results and prospects may be below the expectations of investors or may be lower than those of companies with comparable market capitalizations, which could lead to a material decline in the market price of our common or preferred shares. An increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common shares is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may desire a higher distribution rate on our common shares or seek securities paying higher dividends or interest. The market price of our common shares likely will be based primarily on the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to our properties and our related distributions to shareholders, and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions can affect the market price of our common shares. For instance, if interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate, the market price of our common shares could decrease because potential investors may require a higher yield on our common shares as market rates on interest-bearing securities, such as bonds, rise. In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our non-hedged variable rate debt, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our shareholders. 27 Table of Contents We have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot assure of our ability to pay dividends in the future or the amount of any dividends. We intend to make quarterly distributions to our shareholders in amounts such that we distribute all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year, subject to certain adjustments. Even though we have made distributions on our common shares each fiscal quarter since January 1, 2004, we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any risk factors in our subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings. For example, we significantly reduced our quarterly distribution during 2009. Comparable companies to ours have also reduced and, in some cases, eliminated their distribution payments. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of trustees and their payment and amount will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT status and other factors as our board of trustees may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future or that the distributions will be made in amounts similar to our historic distributions. In particular, our outstanding debt, and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements, could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our equity securities, including paying dividends. Further, distributions with respect to our common shares are subject to our ability to first satisfy our obligations to pay distributions to the holders of our Series A Preferred Shares, and future offerings of preferred shares could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common shares. In addition, some of our distributions may include a return of capital or may be taxable distributions of our shares or debt securities. Future offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common and preferred shares upon liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, which would dilute our existing shareholders and may be senior to our common shares or senior to or on parity with our preferred shares for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our equity securities. In the future, particularly as we seek to acquire and develop additional real estate assets consistent with our growth strategy, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or additional offerings of equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes and series of preferred shares or common shares. For example, during 2010 and thus far during 2011, we sold approximately 18.3 million common shares and 4.6 million preferred shares in underwritten public offerings. Our preferred shares will rank junior to all of our existing and future debt and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Further, upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common shares. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our equity securities, or both. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our equity securities bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our equity securities and diluting their share holdings in us. Shares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of common shares, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common shares. Sales of substantial amounts of common shares, including common shares issuable upon (i) the redemption of units of our Operating Partnership, (ii) exercise of options, and (iii) the conversion of our Operating Partnerships 4.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common shares and impede our ability to raise capital. Any substantial sale of our common shares could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares. The Company also may issue from time to time additional common shares or preferred shares or units of our Operating Partnership in connection with the acquisition of properties, and we may grant demand or piggyback registration rights in connection with these issuances. Sales of substantial amounts of securities or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our securities. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through a sale of additional equity securities. 28 Table of Contents Holders of Series A Preferred Shares have extremely limited voting rights. Holders of Series A Preferred Shares have extremely limited voting rights. Our common shares are the only class of our equity securities carrying full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of Series A Preferred Shares exist primarily with respect to the ability to appoint additional trustees to our Board of Trustees in the event that six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on our Series A Preferred Shares are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our declaration of trust or our Series A Preferred Shares Articles Supplementary that materially and adversely affect the rights of Series A Preferred Shares holders or create additional classes or series of preferred shares that are senior to our Series A Preferred Shares. Other than very limited circumstances, holders of Series A Preferred Shares will not have voting rights. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 29 Table of Contents
