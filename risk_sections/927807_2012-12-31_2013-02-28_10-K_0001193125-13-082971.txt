Business Description of Business Intervest Bancshares Corporation (IBC) is a bank holding company incorporated in 1993 under the laws of the State of Delaware and its common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol IBCA. IBC is the parent company of Intervest National Bank (INB) and owns 100% of its capital stock. IBCs primary purpose is the ownership of INB. It does not engage in any other business activities other than, from time to time, a limited amount of real estate mortgage lending, including the participation in loans originated by INB. IBC from time to time may issue debt and equity securities as needed to raise funds for working capital purposes. IBC also owns 100% of the capital stock of four statutory business trusts (Intervest Statutory Trust II, III, IV and V), all of which are unconsolidated entities for financial statement purposes. The trusts do not conduct business and were formed prior to 2006 for the sole purpose of issuing and administering trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to IBC. Prior to 2011, IBC also owned 100% of Intervest Mortgage Corporation (IMC) whose business had focused on a limited amount of commercial and multifamily real estate lending funded by the issuance of its subordinated debentures in public offerings. IMC ceased doing business and was merged into IBC effective January 1, 2011, and IMCs then remaining net assets of $9.5 million were transferred to IBC. 2 Table of Contents INB is a nationally chartered commercial bank that opened on April 1, 1999 and accounts for 99% of our assets. In addition to its headquarters and full-service banking office in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, INB has a total of six full-service banking offices in Pinellas County, Florida - four in Clearwater, one in Clearwater Beach and one in South Pasadena. INB also has an ownership interest in a number of limited liability companies whose sole purpose is to own title to real estate INB acquires through foreclosure. References to we, us and our in this report refer to IBC and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise specified. The offices of IBC and INBs headquarters and full-service banking office are located on the entire fourth floor of One Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, New York, 10020-2002. The main telephone number is 212-218-2800. Our business is banking and real estate lending conducted through INBs operations. INB conducts a personalized commercial and consumer banking business that attracts deposits from the general public. It also provides internet banking services through its web site www.intervestnatbank.com. INB solicits deposit accounts from individuals, small businesses and professional firms located throughout its primary market areas in New York and Florida by offering of a variety of deposit products and providing online and telephone banking. INBs web site also attracts deposit customers from both within and outside its primary market areas. INB uses these deposits, together with funds generated from its operations, principal repayments of loans and securities and other sources, to originate mortgage loans secured by real estate and to purchase investment securities. INBs deposit flows and the rates it pays on deposits are influenced by interest rates on competing investments available to depositors and general market rates of interest. INBs loan volume is affected primarily by the interest rates it charges on loans, customer demand for loans, the general supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its competitors, and the terms and credit risks associated with the loans. INB faces strong competition in the attraction of deposits and the origination of loans. INBs deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to the extent permitted by law. INBs core data processing is outsourced and is performed by Fiserv, Inc, a leading global provider of information management and electronic commerce systems for the financial services industry. Our revenues consist of interest, dividends and fees earned on our interest-earning assets, which are comprised of mortgage loans, securities and other short-term investments, and noninterest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income generated from our interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is dependent upon the interest-rate spread, which is the difference between the yield earned on interest-earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Our noninterest income is derived mostly from loan and other banking fees as well as income from loan prepayments. When a mortgage loan is repaid prior to maturity, we may recognize prepayment income, which consists of the recognition of unearned fees associated with such loans at the time of payoff and the receipt of additional prepayment fees and/or interest in certain cases in accordance with the prepayment provisions in the mortgage loan. The amount and timing of, as well as income from loan prepayments, if any, cannot be predicted with certainty and can fluctuate significantly. Normally, the number of mortgage loans that are prepaid tends to increase during periods of declining interest rates and tends to decrease during periods of increasing interest rates. However, given the nature and type of the mortgage loans we originate, we may still experience loan prepayments notwithstanding the effects of movements in interest rates. Loan prepayment income can be significant to our net operating results. Our expenses consist of interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, which are comprised of deposits, borrowed funds, as well as our operating and general expenses. Our noninterest expenses are derived primarily from the following: salaries and employee benefits; occupancy and equipment; data processing; advertising and promotion; professional fees and services; FDIC insurance; general insurance; real estate activities; and other operating and general expenses. We also record provisions for loan and real estate losses and income tax expense or benefit. Our profitability is affected by all the factors discussed above and is also significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions and changes in real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area and the State of Florida, our primary market areas, and by related monetary and fiscal policies of banking regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRB) and the FDIC. 3 Table of Contents INB is subject to the supervision, regulation and examination of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (OCC). IBC is subject to examination and regulation by the FRB and is also a participant in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program. As discussed elsewhere in this report, INB and IBC are party to formal agreements with their respective primary regulators since early 2010 which also affects our business. Business Strategy Our business strategy is to attract deposits and use those deposits along with other funds to originate commercial and multifamily real estate loans on a profitable basis, while maintaining the combination of efficient customer service and loan underwriting, a low-cost infrastructure and a strong capital position in excess of the well-capitalized standards to support our current operations and potential future growth. We rely upon the relationships we have developed with our borrowers and brokers with whom we have done business in the past as primary sources of new loans. We believe that our extensive experience with commercial and multifamily real estate lending coupled with our ability to rapidly and efficiently analyze, process and close mortgage loans gives us a competitive advantage. Our goal is to deliver personalized service and respond with flexibility to customer needs. We consider the ability of our management to be both accessible and responsive to both brokers and borrowers as a core strength of our organization, and one of the reasons we can make timely decisions on lending opportunities. Our senior lending officers have extensive lending expertise with excellent reputations and are known in the market for their flexibility, ability to structure deals and for honoring commitments. We provide a high level of service due to our knowledge of our customer-base and the market areas we serve. We believe all the aforementioned factors distinguish us from larger banks that operate in our primary market areas. Our lending model focuses on acquisition loans for income producing properties that have sufficient cash flow to support the loans debt service and have rents that are below market with the likelihood of increasing over time. Our lending activities are comprised almost entirely of the origination for our loan portfolio of first mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate. As a matter of policy, we do not own or originate construction/development loans or condominium conversion loans. We generally lend in geographical areas that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped, with a concentration of loans on properties located in New York and Florida. Market Area for Deposits Our primary market area for our New York office is the New York metropolitan area, consisting of the five boroughs of New York City and the areas surrounding them. New York City is the nations financial capital and the home of more than 8 million individuals representing virtually every race and nationality. It also has a vibrant and diverse business community with many businesses and professional service firms. Historically, the New York City metropolitan area has benefited from being the corporate headquarters of many large industrial and commercial national companies, which have, in turn, attracted many smaller companies, particularly within the service industry. At June 30, 2012, INB ranked 35th out of 91 financial institutions in Manhattan with a deposit market share of 0.10%. Total market deposits in Manhattan at that date exceeded $682 billion. INBs branch in Rockefeller Center had a deposit size of $663 million at June 30, 2012 compared to a $987 million average branch size of all financial institutions operating in Manhattan. Our primary market area for our Florida offices is Pinellas County, which is the most populous county in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. This area also has many seasonal residents. The Tampa Bay area is located on the West Coast of Florida, midway up the Florida peninsula. The major cities in the area are Tampa (Hillsborough County) and St. Petersburg and Clearwater (Pinellas County). At June 30, 2012, INB ranked 7th out of 36 financial institutions in Pinellas County with a deposit market share of 3.18%. Total market deposits in Pinellas County at that date exceeded $29 billion. INBs Florida branches had an average deposit size of $152 million per branch at June 30, 2012 compared to a $92 million average branch size of all financial institutions operating in Pinellas County. INBs deposit-gathering market also includes its internet web site: www.intervestnatbank.com, which attracts deposit customers from both within and outside its primary market areas. 4 Table of Contents Competition In one or more aspects of our business, we compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Most of these competitors are larger than we are and are increasing their efforts to serve smaller commercial borrowers. In addition, many of these competitors, by virtue of their size and resources, may enjoy efficiencies and competitive advantages over us in pricing, delivery and marketing of their products and services. We believe that, despite the continued growth of large institutions and the potential for large out-of-area banking and financial institutions to enter our market area, there will continue to be opportunities for efficiently-operated, service-oriented, well-capitalized, community-based banking organizations to grow by serving customers that are not well served by larger institutions or do not wish to bank with such large institutions. Competition for depositors funds and for credit-worthy loan customers is intense and is based upon interest rates and other credit and service charges, the quality of service provided, the convenience of banking facilities, the products offered and, in the case of larger commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. Lending Activities General. Our lending activities focus on acquisition loans, and to a lesser extent loans to refinance existing mortgages, on income producing properties that have sufficient cash flow to support the loans debt service as well as rents that we believe are below market with the likelihood of increasing over time. Our lending activities are comprised almost entirely of the origination for our loan portfolio of first mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate (including rental cooperative/condominium apartment buildings, office buildings, mixed-use properties, retail shopping centers, hotels, restaurants, industrial buildings, warehouses, parking lots/garages, mobile home parks, self-storage facilities and some vacant land). We also offer commercial and consumer loans, although we do emphasize such lending. Sources of Loans. Historically, mortgage brokers have been the source of substantially all of the real estate loans we originate. The brokers are paid a fee by the borrower upon the funding of the loan. Our reputation within the real estate community, with both borrowers and brokers, is critical to our ability to originate loans and generate revenue therefrom. To a lesser extent, our loan originations are also derived from advertising in newspapers and trade journals, existing customers, direct solicitation by our officers and walk-in customers. Our volume of loan originations is dependent on a number of factors, including loan demand and whether the terms and credit risks associated with potential new loans are suitable for our portfolio and meet our underwriting standards. Lending Areas. We tend to lend in areas that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped, with a concentration of loans on properties located in New York and Florida. A large number of the properties in New York are located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Staten Island and the Bronx. Historically, the bulk of our multifamily lending activity has been in the New York City market. Many of the multifamily properties located in New York City and surrounding boroughs consist of pre- and post-war walkup, elevator and loft buildings, including brownstones and townhouses, and they may also be subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws, which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents and the propertys cash flow, which may in turn limit the borrowers ability to repay those mortgage loans. Outside of New York, nearly all of our loans on multifamily properties are garden style apartments, which refer to a large development of small apartment buildings perhaps two to four stories tall. A large number of the properties in Florida are located in Clearwater, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Miami. At December 31, 2012, we also had loans on properties in Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia. Lending Policies and Criteria. Our lending activities are conducted pursuant to INBs Board-approved written policies and defined lending limits, including the types and amounts of loans we can originate. As a national bank, INB may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of INBs unimpaired capital and surplus. Additional amounts may be loaned, not in excess of 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loans or extensions of credit are secured by readily-marketable collateral. INBs internal policy requires full approval of its Board if any loan application amount exceeds 5% of its regulatory capital or exceeds 7.5% of regulatory capital for its loan-to-one-borrower limit. 5 Table of Contents In originating real estate loans, we primarily consider the net operating income generated by the underlying property to support the loans debt service, including whether the rents are below market, the marketability and value of the property, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower with respect to the property, and any lending experience we may have with the borrower. All new loans are referred to one of our two senior lending officers, our Chairman and INBs President, both of whom have substantial experience in commercial and multifamily real estate lending. Generally, all loans that we originate must be first reviewed and approved by INBs Loan Committee, which is comprised of three members of its Board of Directors, one of whom is also our Chairman. As part of our policies for real estate loans, loan-to-value ratios (the ratio that the original principal amount of the loan bears to the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan at the time of origination) on loans originated by us typically do not exceed 80% and in practice, rarely exceed 75%. Additionally, debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of the net operating income generated by the property securing the loan to the required debt service) typically are not less than 1.2 times. For loans on properties where there is limited or no cash flow being generated (including land loans), we rely on capable hands-on owners who, over time, can improve the property and cash flow therefrom and are able to meet the loans debt service requirements through their other verified sources of income, while such improvements are being made. Our underwriting procedures require the following: an appraisal of the property securing the mortgage loan that is performed by a licensed or certified appraiser approved by us to determine the propertys adequacy as collateral; a physical inspection of the property by us; mortgage title insurance; flood insurance when required; fire insurance; casualty, liability and boiler and machinery insurance; and environmental surveys. In addition, we have an internal and external appraisal review process to monitor and evaluate third-party appraisals. We also perform other analyses which may include: the condition and use of the subject property; the propertys income-producing capacity and its current level of rents; and the quality, experience and financial creditworthiness of the propertys owner. Credit reports and other verifications, including searches related to the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the USA Patriot Act, are obtained to substantiate specific information relating to the applicants income, credit standing and legal status. We may also require personal guarantees from the principals of our borrowers as additional security, although loans are often originated on a limited recourse basis. Our mortgage loans are also not insured or guaranteed by governmental agencies. In the event of a default, our ability to ultimately recover our investment in the loan is dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property. Lending Risks. Commercial and multifamily real estate loans are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional single family residential loans because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying real estate. Included in this category are loans we originate on vacant or substantially vacant properties, all of which typically have limited or no income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment, which add an additional element of risk. Our vacant land loans normally have no income streams and also depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment. We define substantially vacant properties as follows: commercial real estate - occupancy of less than 70% of rentable square feet; and for multifamily - occupancy of less than 70% of rentable apartments. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $55 million of such loans. We also have certain loans categorized as 1-4 family loans, which consist almost entirely of loans secured by blocks of investor-owned individual condominium dwelling units. We normally make these loans to investors who purchase multiple condo units that remain unsold after a condo conversion or the unsold units in a new condo development. The units are normally rented for a number of years until the economy improves and the units can be sold as originally intended. Nearly all of these loans are in our Florida market. Although these loans are classified necessarily as 1-4 family as required by regulatory guidance, they are underwritten by us in accordance with our commercial and multifamily underwriting polices and their risk characteristics are essentially the same as our multifamily real estate lending, and we risk weight them for regulatory capital purposes at 100%. All the above loans require ongoing evaluation and monitoring since they may be affected to a greater degree by adverse conditions in the real estate markets or the economy or changes in government regulation. 6 Table of Contents Loan Terms. Historically we have originated short-term loans with balloon payments at maturity and with terms of no more than 5 years and with either fixed or variable interest rates, including loans with predetermined interest rate increases over the life of the loan. Our real estate loans typically provide for periodic payments of interest and principal during the term of the loan, with the remaining principal balance and any accrued interest due at the maturity date. Loans with balloon payments at maturity require a substantial part of or the entire original principal amount to be paid in one lump sum payment at maturity. If the net revenue from the property, or other sources of cash flow from the borrower, is not sufficient to make all debt service payments due on the loan or, if at maturity or the due date of any balloon payment, the owner of the property fails to raise the funds (through refinancing the loan, sale of the property or otherwise) to make the lump sum payment, we could sustain a loss on our loan. We normally charge loan origination fees on the mortgage loans we originate based on a percentage of the principal amount of the loan. These fees are normally comprised of a fee that is received from the borrower at the time the loan is originated and another similar fee that is contractually due when the loan is repaid (which we may refer to as an exit fee). We record this contractual exit fee as a receivable when the loan is originated. The total of origination and exit fees, net of related direct loan origination costs, are deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to the loans yield. We also earn other fee income and charges from the servicing of the loans we originate. We may also experience loan prepayments and re-investment risk associated with the resulting proceeds. Recent Lending Trends. Recent conditions in the marketplace as described below have resulted in a large number of our loans originated prior to 2010 to be repaid through refinancing by other institutions and our new loan originations being more weighted towards commercial real estate loans, with an emphasis on mixed-use properties and retail strip centers in the New York City metropolitan area. We have also increased our lending over the last two years on loans to investors that are secured by blocks of 1-4 family condominiums due to attractive collateral values and yields in this market, particularly in our Florida market. Over the past few years, due to increased liquidity in the banking system and widespread increasing competition for real estate loans, particularly multifamily loans in the New York City metropolitan area, the effective loan rates for both multifamily and commercial real estate loans have been driven down substantially from historical levels, with rates most recently being offered at 3% or below for 5 to 10 year multifamily balloon product, with a portion being interest only loans. In addition to this aggressive pricing by our competitors, government agency programs have increased the attractiveness of these loans and have further fueled interest rate and term competition. Further, the low interest rates have driven up the size of these loans in relation to the value of the underlying collateral. We have also seen a shift over the years of rental properties being converted to condominium or cooperative status which takes them out of the normal multifamily market. All of these conditions have reduced what we believe to be suitable lending opportunities for us during the past few years, particularly in the multifamily real estate market. The trend described above, in addition to gradually reducing the overall yield on our loan portfolio as well as that of the banking industry in general, has caused our total commercial real estate loans as a percentage of our total loans to increase since the end of 2008 from 63% to 77% at December 31, 2012, while our multifamily loans, inclusive of loans on investor owned condominiums, as a percentage of total loans has decreased from 35% to 23%. The average yield on our entire loan portfolio has also declined from 6.48% in 2008 to 6.06% in 2012. Additionally, during the same time frame, as a result of competitive market conditions, lower pricing in originating loans and borrower preference for fixed-rate product, we have originated nearly all fixed-rate loans with somewhat longer maturities. Fixed-rate loans constituted approximately 89% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2012. The portfolio had a weighted average life of approximately 3.9 years at December 31, 2012, compared with 3.0 years at December 31, 2008. We cannot predict whether all the trends or factors noted above will continue for an additional extended period and how they will impact our loan origination volumes and profitability over the long term. At December 31, 2012, our real estate loans consisted of 538 loans with an aggregate principal balance of $1.11 billion and an average loan size of $2.1 million. Loans with principal balances of more than $10 million consisted of 10 loans with an aggregate principal balance of $129 million, with the largest loan being $16.7 million. Loans with principal balances of $5 million to $10 million consisted of 38 loans and aggregated to $246 million. 7 Table of Contents The two tables that follow set forth information regarding the loan portfolio.

Asset Quality In addition to our underwriting standards discussed previously, after a loan is originated, we undertake various steps (such as an annual physical inspection of the subject property and periodic monitoring of loan documentation, rent rolls, cash flows and the value of the property securing the loan) with the objective of quickly identifying, evaluating and initiating corrective actions if necessary. 10 Table of Contents We constantly monitor the payment status of our loans and pursue a timely follow-up on any delinquencies, including initiating collection procedures even before a loan is 90 days past due, as deemed necessary. We also assess substantial late fees on delinquent loan payments and other service charges. Our loans are subject to the risk of default, otherwise known as credit risk, which represents the possibility of us not recovering amounts due from our borrowers. The credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrowers ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the value of the real estate securing the loan. A borrowers ability to pay in the case of multifamily and commercial real estate loans is typically dependent on the cash flow generated by underlying property, which can be impacted by economic conditions. Other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in financial and real estate markets, may also impact a borrowers ability to pay. Real estate values are also impacted by a variety of other factors including collection or foreclosure delays. Additionally, political issues, including armed conflicts, acts of terrorism, or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, may have an adverse impact on economic conditions of the country as a whole and may be more pronounced in specific geographic regions. All of these factors can affect the rents and occupancy levels of the collateral properties, which in turn affect their market value and the amounts we may recover in the event of a default. Loan concentrations are defined as amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or on properties located in a particular geographic area. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans. The properties securing these loans are also concentrated in two states, New York and Florida. Many of the properties securing our loans are also located in geographical areas that are being revitalized or redeveloped, which can be impacted more severely by a downturn in real estate values. We place loans on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days or more past due or earlier in certain cases, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. All previously accrued and uncollected interest and late charges on loans placed on nonaccrual status are reversed through a charge to interest income and the amortization of any unearned fee income is discontinued. While loans are on nonaccrual status, interest income is normally recognized only to the extent cash is received until a return to accrual status is warranted. In some circumstances, interest continues to accrue on mortgage loans that have matured and the borrower continues to make monthly payments of principal and interest. These loans are classified as 90 days past due and still accruing interest if they are well secured and in the process of collection. We estimate the fair value of the properties that collateralize our impaired loans based on a variety of information, including third party appraisals and our managements judgment of other factors. Our internal policy is to obtain externally prepared appraisals (or in limited cases indications of value from licensed appraisers or local real estate brokers) as follows: for all impaired loans; for restructured or renewed loans; upon classification or downgrade of a loan; upon accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure; upon transfer of a loan to foreclosed real estate; and at least annually thereafter for all of our impaired and substandard rated loans and real estate owned through foreclosure. In addition to obtaining appraisals, we also consider the knowledge and experience of our two senior lending officers (our Chairman and INBs President) and INBs Chief Credit Officer related to values of properties in our geographical market areas. These officers take into account various information, including: local and national real estate market data provided by third parties; the consideration of the type, condition, location and occupancy of the specific collateral property as well as the current economic conditions and demand for the specific property in the area the property is located in assessing our internal estimates of fair value. Additionally, we require that all third-party appraisals we receive be reviewed by a different external appraiser for reasonableness. From time to time, we may restructure a loan. A loan that we restructure, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties, and for which we have granted certain concessions to the borrower that we would not otherwise have considered is considered a troubled debt restructure or TDR. These concessions are made to provide payment relief generally consisting of the deferral of principal and or interest payments for a period of time, a partial reduction in interest payments or an extension of the maturity date. In determining if a concession has been made, we also consider if the borrower is able to access funds in the general market place at a market rate for debt with similar risk characteristics as the restructured debt. A loan that is extended or renewed at a stated interest rate equal to the current interest rate for a new loan originated by us with similar risk is not reported as a TDR. 11 Table of Contents We normally place a TDR on nonaccrual status upon restructure and subsequently return the TDR to an accrual status if the ultimate collectability of all contractual principal is assured, and the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory payment performance either before or after the restructuring, usually consisting of a minimum six-month period. We may acquire and retain title to real property pursuant to a foreclosure of a mortgage loan in the normal course of business either directly or through a subsidiary or an affiliated entity. These properties are held for sale. Upon foreclosure of the property, the related loan is transferred from the loan portfolio to the foreclosed real estate category at the estimated fair value of the property, less estimated selling costs. Such amount becomes the new cost basis of the property. Adjustments made to reduce the carrying value at the time of transfer are charged to the allowance for loan losses as a loan chargeoff. After foreclosure, we periodically perform market valuations (which includes obtaining an appraisal of the collateral property at least annually) and, based on these valuations, the property is carried at the lower of its cost basis or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. Changes in the valuation allowance of the property are charged to the Provision for Real Estate Losses. Revenues and expenses from operations of the property are included in the caption Real Estate Activities Expenses. The table below summarizes nonperforming assets, TDRs, past due loans and selected ratios at the dates indicated.

Interest income from payments made on nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis (or when collected) if the outstanding principal is determined to be collectible. (2) Represent loans whose terms have been modified through the deferral of principal and/or a partial reduction in interest payments, or extension of maturity term and are current as to payments and performing in accordance with their restructured terms, but are required to be classified nonaccrual in accordance with regulatory guidance. At December 31, 2012, such loans totaled $36 million and were yielding 4.67% on a weighted average basis. Interest income from payments on such classified loans is also recognized on a cash basis. A TDR that is on nonaccrual status can only be returned to accrual status if ultimate collectability of contractual principal is assured and the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory payment performance either before or after the restructuring (usually for a period of no shorter than six months). We have a number of TDRs (which aggregated to 7 loans or $18.9 million at December 31, 2012) that have been partially charged-off (by a cumulative total of $7.8 million as of December 31, 2012). For these TDRs, the evaluation for full repayment of contractual principal must include the collectability of amounts charged off. Although the loans have been partially charged off for financial statement purposes, the borrowers remain obligated to pay all contractual principal due on all of the TDRs. (3) See note 3 to the financial statements included in this report for a discussion of these securities. (4) Represent loans whose terms have been modified through the deferral of principal and/or a partial reduction in interest payments, or extension of maturity term and are maintained on accrual status. At December 31, 2012, all loans were performing and current and they had a weighted-average yield of approximately 5.48%. (5) At December 31, 2012, the balance consisted of two loans that have matured and the borrowers were making monthly loan payments.

(6) Property acquired and sold in the fourth quarter of 2012 for $3.3 million. Propertys original cost basis upon acquisition was $3.2 million. We review the estimated fair value of our portfolio of real estate owned through foreclosure at least quarterly by performing market valuations of the properties, which normally consist of obtaining externally prepared appraisals at least annually for every property, as well as performing reviews of economic and real estate market conditions in the local area where the property is located, including taking into consideration discussions with real estate brokers and interested buyers, in order to determine if a valuation allowance is needed to reflect any decrease in the estimated fair value of the property since acquisition. All of the properties owned at December 31, 2012 were being marketed for sale. The table below summarizes the change in foreclosed real estate for the periods indicated.

For additional information and discussion on the allowance for loan losses, see note 4 the financial statements and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. Security Investment Activities Our security investments are normally purchased by INB and are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost when INB has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Historically, INB has invested in debt securities that are issued directly by the U.S. government or one of its agencies with short- to intermediate-maturity terms. In March 2012, INB also began purchasing, from time to time, residential mortgage backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies. INB also owns some corporate securities (less than 1% of the securities portfolio), consisting of trust-preferred notes that were purchased prior to 2008. INBs goal is to maintain a securities portfolio with a short weighted-average life of no more than five years, which allows for the resulting cash flows to either be reinvested in similar securities, used to fund loan commitments, pay off borrowings or fund deposit outflows as needed. INBs securities portfolio does not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value and aggregate market value in excess of 10% of its stockholders equity, excluding those issued by the U.S. government or its agencies (see Item 1A Risk Factors). Our security investments carry market risk (insofar as increases in market interest rates would generally cause a decline in their market value), prepayment risk (insofar as they may be called or repaid before their stated maturity during times of low market interest rates and we may then have to reinvest the funds at a lower interest rate) and credit risk (insofar as they may default, particularly as it relates to our investments in corporate securities). All of our investments in corporate securities have become other than temporarily impaired as described in note 2 to the financial statements in this report. 15 Table of Contents INB may from time to time maintain a securities available-for-sale portfolio for securities that it will hold for indefinite periods of time that may sold in response to changes in interest rates or other factors, including asset/liability management strategies. We have never engaged in trading activities. We may also invest in other short-term instruments (including overnight and term federal funds, bank commercial paper and certificates of deposit) to temporarily invest excess cash flow generated from our deposit-gathering activities and operations. The table below summarizes the amortized cost (carrying value), contractual maturities and weighted-average yields of INBs portfolio of securities held to maturity. The table excludes Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRB) stock investments required to be held by INB in order for it to be a member of these institutions.

Sources of Funds Our primary sources of funds consist of the following: retail deposits obtained through INBs branch offices and the mail; principal repayments of loans; maturities and calls of securities; borrowings through FHLB advances or the federal funds market; brokered deposits; and cash flow provided by operating activities. INBs deposit accounts are solicited from individuals, small businesses and professional firms located throughout INBs primary market areas through the offering of a variety of deposit products. INB also uses its internet web site www.intervestnatbank.com to attract deposit customers from both within and outside its primary market areas. INB believes it does not have a concentration of deposits from any one source. INBs deposit products include the following: certificates of deposit (including denominations of $100,000 or more); individual retirement accounts (IRAs); checking and other demand deposit accounts; negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts; savings accounts; and money market accounts. Interest rates offered by INB on deposit accounts are normally competitive with those in INBs primary market areas. 16 Table of Contents The determination of rates and terms on deposit accounts also take into account INBs liquidity requirements, outstanding loan commitments, desired capital levels and government regulations. Maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposit products are reviewed and established by INB on a periodic basis. INB also offers internet banking services, ATM services with access to local, state and national networks, wire transfers, automated clearing house (ACH) transfers, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks and automated drafts for various accounts. In addition, INB offers safe deposit boxes to its customers in Florida. INB periodically reviews the scope of the banking products and services it offers consistent with market opportunities and its available resources. INB relies heavily on certificates of deposit (time deposits) as its main source of funds from deposit accounts. See the sections Supervision and Regulation and Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report for additional information on deposits and a discussion on regulatory restrictions that have been placed on INB with respect to the pricing of its deposit products and accepting and rolling over maturing brokered deposits.

As a member of the FHLB and FRB, INB can borrow from these institutions on a secured basis using INBs security investments and certain loans as collateral. INB also has an agreement with two correspondent banks whereby it could borrow overnight a limited amount of funds on an unsecured basis.

IBCs historical sources of working capital have been derived from the issuance of its common stock through public or private offerings, exercise of its common stock warrants/options, the issuance of its trust preferred securities and preferred stock and the issuance of its subordinated debentures to the public. During 2010, IBC raised a total of $25 million of new capital in two separate capital raising transactions. For a further discussion, see note 10 to the financial statements in this report. In December 2008, IBC voluntarily applied for and was approved to participate in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and sold to the U.S. Treasury 25,000 shares of its Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, along with a ten year warrant to purchase at any time up to 691,882 shares of IBCs common stock for $5.42 per share, for a total cash investment of $25 million from the Treasury. Since early 2010, IBC has been prohibited by its primary regulator from paying dividends, making interest payments and incurring new debt. For a further discussion of TARP and the regulatory limitations, see the section Supervision and Regulation and notes 10, 11 and 19 to the financial statements in this report.

We provide various benefits to our employees, including group life, health, dental and disability insurance, a 401(k) retirement plan and a long-term employee incentive plan. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Federal and State Taxation IBC and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined state and city income tax returns in New York. IBC also files a franchise tax return in Delaware. INB files a state income tax return in Florida. INB also files state tax returns, as needed, for certain entities that own title to real estate INB acquires through foreclosure. All the above returns are filed on a calendar year basis and we report our income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting. Consolidated income tax returns have the effect of eliminating intercompany income and expense, including dividends, from the computation of our taxable income for the taxable year in which the items occur. In accordance with an income tax sharing agreement, income tax charges or credits are allocated among IBC and its subsidiaries on the basis of their respective taxable income or taxable loss that is included in our income tax returns. Banks and bank holding companies are subject to federal and state income taxes in essentially the same manner as other corporations. Florida, New York State and New York City taxable income is calculated under applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), with some modifications required by state and city law. Although INBs federal income tax liability is determined under provisions of the Code, which is applicable to all taxpayers, Sections 581 through 597 of the Code apply specifically to financial institutions. In addition to the regular income tax, we are subject to a Federal alternative minimum tax, or AMT, in an amount equal to 20% of alternative minimum taxable income to the extent the AMT exceeds our regular income tax. The AMT is available as a credit against future regular income tax. New York State imposes an annual franchise tax on banking corporations, based on net income allocable to New York State. If, however, the application of an alternative minimum tax (based on taxable assets allocated to New York, alternative net income, or a flat minimum fee) results in a greater tax, an alternative minimum tax is imposed. We are also subject to the alternative minimum tax for New York City (which is similar to the New York State alternative minimum tax). As a Delaware corporation not earning income in Delaware, IBC is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware. The tax is imposed as a percentage of the capital base of IBC and is reported in the line item All other in the noninterest expense section of the statements of operations. Total annual franchise tax expense was $0.2 million in 2012, $0.2 million in 2011 and $0.1 million in 2010. See note 14 to the financial statements and the section Critical Accounting Policies in this report for a further discussion of income taxes and our deferred tax asset. 19 Table of Contents Investment in Subsidiaries The following table provides information regarding IBCs subsidiaries: At December 31, 2012 Subsidiarys Earnings (Loss) For The Period: % of For the Year Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) Voting Stock Owned by IBC TotalInvestmentBy IBC IBCs Equityin UnderlyingNet Assets 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Interevst National Bank 100% $254,815 $254,815 $13,494 $12,704 $(50,242) $5,722 $8,256 Intervest Mortgage Corporation (1) - - - - - (1,572) (1,098) 831 Intervest Statutory Trusts 100% 1,702 1,702 - - - - - (1) Prior to 2011, IBC owned 100% of Intervest Mortgage Corporation whose business had focused on commercial and multifamily real estate lending funded by the issuance of its subordinated debentures in public offerings. IMC no longer conducts business and was merged into IBC effective January 1, 2011 and IMCs then remaining net assets of $9.5 million were transferred to IBC on that date. INB also has an ownership interest in a number of limited liability companies whose sole purpose is to own title to real estate INB acquires through foreclosure. These entities are normally dissolved when the properties are sold. Supervision and Regulation The supervision and regulation of banks or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance fund (DIF) and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our stockholders or creditors. The regulatory agencies have broad enforcement power, including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions and formal agreements, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision or formal agreement. Any changes in the aforementioned may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Bank Holding Company Regulation IBC is a holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by FRB. The Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a broad range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Scope of Permissible Activities. A bank holding company generally may not engage in, or acquire or control, directly or indirectly, voting securities or assets of any company that is engaged in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks. Source of Strength for Subsidiaries. A bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. See the section Written Agreement below. Mergers and Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. Subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it may merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or, direct or indirect, ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company, if after such acquisition the bank holding company would control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting securities of such bank or bank holding company. Anti-Tying Restrictions. Subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. Capital Adequacy. The FRB has capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that are based upon a risk-based capital determination, whereby a bank holding companys capital adequacy is determined by assigning different categories of assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. 20 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2012, current guidelines divide the qualifying total capital of a bank holding company into Tier 1 capital (core capital elements), Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital elements) and Tier 3 capital (market risk capital elements). Tier 1 capital consists primarily of, subject to certain limitations, common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities. Goodwill and certain other intangibles are excluded from Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital may consist of, subject to certain limitations, an amount equal to the allowance for loan and lease losses, limited other types of preferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital, hybrid capital instruments and term subordinated debt. Tier 3 capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt. The Tier 1 capital must comprise at least 50% of the qualifying total capital categories. Every bank holding company has to achieve and maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4% and a minimum total capital ratio of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. Bank holding companies are also required to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (leverage capital ratio) of at least 3% for strong banks and bank holding companies and a minimum leverage ratio of at least 4% for all other bank holding companies. At December 31, 2012, IBCs Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 20.15% and 21.41%, respectively, and its leverage capital ratio was 14.71%. See the caption entitled Basel III in this section for further discussion of capital requirements. Dividends. IBCs ability to pay cash dividends on its capital stock is dependent upon its level of cash on hand and upon the cash dividends received from INB. IBC must first pay its operating and interest expenses from funds it receives from its subsidiaries. As a result, stockholders may receive cash dividends from IBC only to the extent that funds are available after payment of the aforementioned expenses. In addition, the FRB generally prohibits a bank holding company from paying cash dividends except out of its net income, provided that the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In February 2010, the FRB informed IBC that it may not, without the prior approval of the FRB, pay dividends on or redeem its capital stock, pay interest on or redeem its trust preferred securities, or incur new debt. See the sections Written Agreement and TARP below. Control Acquisitions. The Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the FRB has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Enforcement Authority. The FRB may impose civil or criminal penalties or may institute a cease-and-desist proceeding for the violation of applicable laws and regulations. IBC is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various state securities commissions for matters related to the offering and sale of its securities, and is subject to the SEC rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, reporting to shareholders, proxy solicitation and insider trading. IBCs common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and, as a result, IBC is also subject to the rules of Nasdaq for listed companies. Written Agreement. In January 2011, IBC entered into a written agreement (the Federal Reserve Agreement) with its primary regulator, the FRB, which requires IBCs Board of Directors to take the steps necessary to utilize IBCs financial and managerial resources to serve as a source of strength to INB, including causing INB to comply with its Formal Agreement with its primary regulator, the OCC. In addition, as noted earlier, IBC cannot declare or pay dividends without the prior approval of the FRB and the Director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation of the Board of Governors (the Banking Director). IBC also cannot take any payments representing a reduction in capital from INB without prior approval of the FRB and IBC cannot not make any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on its subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without prior approval from the FRB and the Banking Director. Further, IBC may not incur, increase or guarantee any debt or purchase or redeem any shares of its stock without prior approval of the FRB. IBC was also required within 90 days of the date of the Federal Reserve Agreement to submit a plan to continue to maintain sufficient capital. Finally, IBC must notify the FRB when appointing any new director or senior executive officer or changing responsibilities of any senior executive officer, and IBC is also restricted in making certain severance and indemnification payments. We believe we have taken all necessary actions to promptly address the requirements of the Federal Reserve Agreement and that IBC is in compliance with such agreement as of the date of filing of this report. 21 Table of Contents TARP. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) established a the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP gave the U.S. Treasury authority to deploy up to $750 billion into the U.S. financial system with an objective of improving liquidity in the capital markets. In October 2008, Treasury announced plans to direct $250 billion of this authority into preferred stock investments in banks. On December 23, 2008, IBC voluntarily applied for and was approved to participate in the above program and sold to the Treasury 25,000 shares of IBCs newly issued Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, along with a ten year warrant to purchase at any time up to 691,882 shares of IBCs common stock for $5.42 per share, for a total cash investment of $25 million from the Treasury. See note 10 to the financial statements in this report for a further discussion of the above transaction and other regulatory requirements and restrictions imposed by TARP. Bank Regulation INB is a nationally chartered bank that is subject to regulation and examination by the OCC, its primary regulator, and by virtue of the insurance of INBs deposits, it is also subject to the supervision and regulation of the FDIC. Because INB is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is subject to regulation pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act. In addition, because the FRB regulates IBC, the FRB also has supervisory authority that directly affects INB. The FDIC and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including, but not limited to, the power to terminate deposit insurance and impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties. Transactions with Affiliates. Under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, subject to certain exemptions, INB may engage in a transaction with an affiliate, as such term is defined therein, only if the aggregate amount of the transactions with one affiliate or with all affiliates does not exceed 10% or 20%, respectively, of the capital stock and surplus of INB. INB is also generally prohibited from purchasing a low-quality asset from an affiliate. Any transaction between INB and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Additionally, transactions with affiliates, can only be made on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to INB, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies, or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies. Loans to One Borrower. INB generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2012, INB was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations. Loans to Insiders. INB is prohibited from extending credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests, collectively referred to as insiders, unless the extension of credit is made on substantially the same terms and in accordance with underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons. INB as a matter of policy does not extend such credit and there were no such loans outstanding at December 31, 2012. Reserve Requirements. Pursuant to Regulation D, INB must hold a percentage of certain types of deposits as reserves in the form of vault cash, as a deposit in a Federal Reserve Bank or as a deposit in a pass-through account at a correspondent institution. Dividends. When INB pays cash dividends on its capital stock its pays them to IBC since IBC is the sole shareholder of INB. INBs dividend policy is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining its desired liquidity and capital ratios and debt servicing obligations. INBs board of directors may declare dividends to be paid out of INBs undivided profits. No dividends may be paid by INB without the OCCs approval if the total amount of all dividends, including the proposed dividend, declared by INB in any calendar year exceeds INBs total retained net income for that year, combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. 22 Table of Contents Also, INB may not declare or pay any dividends if, after making the dividend, INB would be undercapitalized and no dividend may be paid by INB if it is in default of any deposit insurance assessment due to the FDIC. In January 2010, INB suspended its cash dividend payments to IBC as required by the OCC. See the section Formal Agreement below. Capital Adequacy. In general, capital adequacy regulations for national banks such as INB, are similar to the FRB guidelines discussed earlier. Under the OCCs current regulations and guidelines as of December 31, 2012, all banks must maintain minimum ratios of capital as follows: Tier 1 capital to total average assets (leverage ratio) - 4%; Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets - 4%; and total capital to risk-weighted assets - 8%. In April 2009, INB agreed with the OCC to maintain its minimum capital ratios at specified levels higher than those otherwise required by applicable regulations as follows: Tier 1 capital to total average assets (leverage ratio) - 9%; Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets - 10%; and total capital to risk-weighted assets - 12%. At December 31, 2012, INBs leverage capital ratio, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 14.44%, 19.80% and 21.06%, respectively, See the section Formal Agreement below. Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking agencies have the authority to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Applicable regulations divide banks into five different categories, depending on their level of capital: (i) a well-capitalized bank; (ii) an adequately capitalized bank; (iii) an undercapitalized bank; (iv) a significantly undercapitalized bank; and (v) a critically undercapitalized bank. A bank is deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or more and a leverage ratio of 5% or more, and the bank is not subject to an order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Currently INB is subject to a formal agreement to meet and maintain a specific capital level above these ratios as denoted earlier. Formal Agreement. In December 2010, INB entered into a formal written agreement (the Formal Agreement) with the OCC. The Formal Agreement superseded and replaced a Memorandum of Understanding dated April 7, 2009 between INB and the OCC. The Formal Agreement requires INB to take certain actions, including (1) creating a compliance committee to monitor and coordinate INBs performance under the Formal Agreement and to submit periodic progress reports to the OCC, (2) the development of strategic and capital plans covering at least three years, (3) completing an assessment of management and ensuring effective management, and (4) developing programs related to: (i) loan portfolio management; (ii) criticized assets; (iii) loan review; (iv) credit concentrations; (v) accounting for other real estate owned; (vi) maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses; (vii) liquidity risk management; and (viii) interest rate risk management. As of December 31, 2012, INB has achieved compliance with all but two of the articles in the Formal Agreement and believes it has taken the steps or submitted the additional required documentation to achieve compliance with these articles, which consist of ensuring effective management and developing a loan concentration program. All of the steps and actions INB has and will continue to take are still subject to the on-going review, satisfaction and acceptance of the OCC. Consequently, timing with respect to full compliance with the Formal Agreement cannot be predicted since many of the steps and actions we have taken need to be in place and operating effectively for a period of time as determined by the OCC in order to achieve full compliance with the Formal Agreement. The Formal Agreement also limits INBs ability to pay dividends to IBC and requires INB to maintain Tier 1 capital at least equal to 9% of adjusted total assets, Tier 1 capital at least equal to 10% of risk-weighted assets; and total risk-based capital at least equal to 12% of risk-weighted assets. These are the same levels that INB agreed to maintain beginning April 7, 2009. Interest Rate and Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Financial institutions that are less than well capitalized are barred from paying interest on their deposit products at rates of interest in excess of 75 basis points above the national rate unless it receives an exemption from the FDIC that the institutions local market rate is above the national rate. In addition, they cannot accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits without approval from their primary regulator. 23 Table of Contents As a result of INBs Formal Agreement with the OCC, INB is not allowed to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits without the prior approval of the OCC and it is also required, in the absence of a waiver from the FDIC, to maintain its deposit pricing at or below the national rates published by the FDIC, plus 75 basis points. INB was in compliance with all of these requirements at December 31, 2012 and has not accessed the brokered deposit market since September 2009. See the section Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report for a further discussion of these restrictions and potential impact to our business. Deposit Insurance Assessments. INBs deposits are insured up to applicable limits through the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. Insured institutions are required to pay insurance premiums based on the risk each institution poses to DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured deposits, subject to limits, and to impose special additional assessments. The FDIC can terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance if it finds that the institution is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner or has violated any rule, regulation, order or condition administered by the institutions regulatory authorities. Any termination of deposit insurance would have a material adverse effect on INB. On December 31, 2009, insured depository institutions were required to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. INB prepaid a total of $15.8 million on December 31, 2009 which related to estimated premiums for 2010 through 2012. The amount was recorded as a prepaid asset and is being charged to expense during the periods to which it relates based on actual premiums assessed in such period. Any unused premium is expected to be credited back to the depository institutions in June 2013. Under the Dodd-Frank Act (discussed later in this section), the reserve ratio of the DIF is no longer capped at 1.50%, and the FDIC is no longer required to refund excess amounts in the DIF to its member banks. The FDIC, in addition, has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute, but with no implementation deadline for the 2% ratio. Additionally, the reserve ratio in a given year may not be less than 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, or the comparable percentage of the assessment base. The FDIC has until September 30, 2020 to raise the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 1.35%. In setting the assessments necessary to meet the 1.35% level, the FDIC adopted assessment rules that look to larger institutions (those with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets) to fund more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio to 1.35%. The FDIC insurance assessment base effective April 1, 2011 is now defined as average total assets minus tangible equity. In addition to deposit liabilities, the new base contains liabilities that did not previously enter into the calculation. Although the new base is larger, new lower assessment rates are more than enough to offset this effect for a large number of community banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Assessment rates assigned to institutions continue to depend on the instructions regulatory exam ratings and other risk measures. Banks are assigned to one of four risk categories based on two criteria: capital adequacy and supervisory ratings. The three capital groups are well-capitalized, adequately capitalized and undercapitalized, consistent with prompt corrective action designations. The three supervisory groups are based primarily on CAMELS ratings, although the FDIC has the ability to consider other factors as well. In general, banks with CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2 are assigned to the A category, banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 are assigned to the B category, and banks with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5 are assigned to the C category. The base assessment rates range from 5 basis points for the lowest risk category to 35 basis points for the highest risk category, with further adjustments (plus or minus) thereto based on an institutions level of unsecured debt and brokered deposits, which make the total assessment rates range from 2.5 basis points to a high of 45 basis points. INBs assessment rate for its most recent billing period was 14 basis points. In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are also required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. That payment is established quarterly and during the four quarters ending December 31, 2012 averaged 0.66 basis points of assessable deposits. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2017 to 2019. Community Reinvestment. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977, INB must assist in meeting the credit needs of the communities in its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods. 24 Table of Contents The FDIC applies the lending, investment and service tests to assess a banks CRA performance and assigns to a bank a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial noncompliance on the basis of the banks performance under these tests. All banks are required to publicly disclose their CRA performance ratings. INBs latest CRA rating was satisfactory. Regulation of Lending Activity. In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, INB is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, and their associated Regulations Z, X and B, respectively. Monetary Policy and Economic Control. Commercial banking is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary policies of the FRB. Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing, availability of borrowing at the discount window, open market operations, the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks deposits and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB. These monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments and deposits, and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB, which have a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, are influenced by various factors, including inflation, unemployment, short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the United States Government. Other Legislation Affecting Us The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 facilitates the interstate expansion and consolidation of banking organizations by permitting bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed to acquire banks located in states outside their home states regardless of whether such acquisitions are authorized under the law of the host state. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, among other things, permits banks, securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate under a common holding company structure. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 requires financial institutions to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and financing of terrorism. Financial institutions are required to collect customer information, monitor transactions and report certain information to U.S. law enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) concerning customers and their transactions. INB has systems and procedures in place designed to comply with the USA Patriot Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed a myriad of corporate governance and accounting measures designed so that shareholders have full, accurate and timely information about the public companies in which they invest. All public companies are affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) of 2010 imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes, including the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies are prohibited from including in their Tier 1 regulatory capital certain hybrid debt and equity securities issued on or after May 19, 2010. Among the securities included in this prohibition are trust preferred securities (TRUPS), which IBC has used in the past as a tool for raising Tier 1 capital. Although IBC is permitted to continue to include its existing outstanding TRUPS in its Tier 1 capital, the prohibition on the use of these securities as Tier 1 capital going forward may limit IBCs ability to raise capital in the future. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act do not apply to any hybrid capital instrument issued prior to October 4, 2010 to the U.S. government or a U.S. government agency under the EESA, such as TARP. Accordingly, IBCs outstanding preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury also continues to count as Tier 1 capital under the provisions of this legislation. 25 Table of Contents Furthermore, under FRB requirements, the amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock (excluding senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury) and qualifying TRUPS, as well as certain types of minority interest, that may be included as Tier 1 capital is limited to 25 percent of the sum of core capital elements net of goodwill. We do not have any goodwill or minority interests. Additionally, the excess amounts of restricted core capital elements in the form of qualifying TRUPS included in Tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of Tier 1 capital (net of goodwill). However, amounts in excess of this limit will still be taken into account in the overall assessment of an organizations funding and financial condition. In the last five years before the underlying subordinated note matures, the associated TRUPS must be treated as limited-life preferred stock. Thus, in the last five years of the life of the note, the outstanding amount of TRUPS is excluded from Tier 1 capital and included in Tier 2 capital, subject, together with subordinated debt and other limited-life preferred stock, to a limit of 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. During this period, the TRUPS will be amortized out of Tier 2 capital by one-fifth of the original amount (less redemptions) each year and excluded totally from Tier 2 capital during the last year of life of the underlying note. Basel III. Current risk-based capital guidelines that banks and bank holding companies are subject to may change beginning in 2013 under new proposed rules, known as Basel III, which generally increase the capital required to be held and narrow the types of instruments qualifying as appropriate capital and impose a new liquidity measurement. On June 7, 2012, U.S. regulators (the FRB, the FDIC and the OCC) issued proposed rules to address the requirements of Basel III. The objective of the regulators is to establish an integrated regulatory capital framework that addresses shortcomings that they believe exist in current regulatory capital requirements that became apparent during the recent financial crisis. The proposed rule would implement in the U.S. the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules were divided into three to minimize burden on smaller and mid-sized banking organizations and to allow firms to focus on the aspects of the proposed revisions that are most relevant to them. The first notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR), titled Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios, Capital Adequacy, and Transition Provisions (the Capital NPR), would apply to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more, and all thrift holding companies. This NPR would: (i) increase the quantity and quality of capital required by proposing a new minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, and raising the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4 percent to 6 percent of risk-weighted assets; (ii) revise the definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses by dividing capital into the following categories: (1) common equity Tier 1 capital (generally consisting of ordinary common shares and retained earnings not paid out as dividends); (2) additional Tier 1 capital (generally, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, which is preferred stock with no maturity date); and Tier 2 capital (which is principally subordinated debt and certain preferred instruments with a minimum original maturity of at least five years, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves). Furthermore, Tier 2 capital would no longer be divided into lower and upper Tier 2. Trust preferred securities (TRUPs), which are a form of debt-like preferred instruments, would be phased out of Tier 1 capital but would generally qualify for Tier 2 capital; (iii) establish limitations on capital distributions, certain discretionary bonus payments and stock repurchases if additional specified amounts, or buffers, of common equity Tier 1 capital are not met; and (iv) introduce a supplementary leverage ratio for internationally active banking organizations. The Basel III proposal would also revise prompt corrective action framework by incorporating the new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of tangible common equity. Prompt corrective action is an enforcement framework used by the regulators to constrain the activities of banking organizations based on the level of regulatory capital. 26 Table of Contents The second NPR, titled Regulatory Capital Rules: Standardized Approach for Risk-weighted Assets; Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements, would apply to the same banking organizations as the Capital NPR. This NPR would revise and harmonize the Boards rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address perceived weaknesses in current rules. Banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets - riskier assets require higher capital cushions and less risky assets require smaller capital cushions. With respect to risk weightings for certain types of assets, under the proposed standardized approach, new risk weights would be assigned to several asset classes effective January 2015. Examples of asset classes that will have higher risk weights include: many loans that are 90 days past due or on non-accrual status; non-traditional residential real estate loans, such as interest-only, balloon or negative amortization mortgages; residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of greater than 80 percent; and certain high volatility commercial real estate loans. Higher capital will also, generally, be needed for certain off-balance sheet items including: loan commitments of not more than a year that are not unconditionally cancelable by the bank; and residential real estate loans the bank sells to investors with representations to repurchase if the borrower defaults within a set period of time. The third NPR, titled Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced Approaches Risk-based Capital Rule; Market Risk Capital Rule, would apply to banking organizations that are active internationally. Because we have no international operations, this rule would not apply to us and is not discussed herein. As the new NPRs phase in, banks could see a decline and/or greater volatility in capital levels to the extent they hold assets to be adjusted. Also, unrealized gains and losses on all available for sale (AFS) securities would be included in Tier 1 capital, rather than just equity securities as is the case under current regulatory capital rules. In summary, Basel III will generally require all U.S. banks, large or small, to hold more capital than under existing rules, especially in the form of common equity. The effect may be to incentivize banks to reduce their risk-weighted assets by reducing their exposures or their level of risk in order to maintain a sufficient return on equity to attract investors. Additionally, increased capital requirements may cause a contraction in the supply of credit from banks, which may drive lending into less regulated parts of the financial sector. There will also be higher substantive and procedural burdens on both residential and commercial lending, which may force many such lenders to exit the industry, and those who remain may be forced to increase pricing for certain mortgage loans. This may negatively affect the demand for loans, which would in turn limit the number of developers and homebuyers in the market. The risk-based capital ratios dramatically increase the risk-weighting of several asset classes, including mortgages that are not plain vanilla and problem loans. In November 2012, U.S. regulators delayed the implementation date of their proposed rules and did not announce a timeframe for implementation due to concerns from many comment letters they received regarding the impact of the rules and the complexity of their implementation. Although it will remain uncertain until final rules have been issued, based on IBCs and INBs most recent calculation of their estimated pro-forma (unaudited) capital ratios under the new rules, we believe that both entities would be in compliance with the Basel III requirements. We further believe that both entities would continue to be considered well capitalized under the new proposed standards, notwithstanding higher capital levels that INB or IBC may be subject to from their primary regulator. Other Regulation - Mortgage Lending Residential properties may be subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws, which may restrict the owner from raising rents on apartments. If real estate taxes, fuel costs and maintenance of and repairs to the property were to increase substantially, and such increases are not offset by increases in rental income, the ability of the owner of the property to make payments due on the loan might be adversely affected. Laws and regulations relating to asbestos require that whenever any work is undertaken in a property in an area in which asbestos is present, the asbestos must be removed or encapsulated in accordance with such and laws and regulations. 27 Table of Contents The cost of asbestos removal or encapsulation may be substantial, and if there were not sufficient cash flow from the property, after debt service on mortgages, to fund the required work, and the owner of the property fails to fund such work from other sources, the value of the property could be adversely affected, with consequent impairment of the security for the mortgage. Laws and regulations relating to the storage, disposal and clean up of hazardous or toxic substances at real property have been adopted. Such laws may impose a lien on the real property superior to any mortgages on the property. In the event such a lien was imposed on any property which serves as security for a mortgage owned by us, the security for such mortgage could be impaired. Our lending business is regulated by federal, state and, in certain cases, local laws, including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and Regulation B. We are also subject to various other federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing, among other things, the licensing of mortgage lenders and servicers. We must comply with procedures mandated for mortgage lenders and servicers, and must provide disclosures to certain borrowers. Failure to comply with these laws, as well as with the laws described above, may result in civil and criminal liability, termination or suspension of licenses, rights of rescission for mortgage loans, lawsuits and/or administrative enforcement actions. Additional legislative and regulatory proposals have been made and others can be expected. It is not possible to predict whether or in what form final proposals may be adopted and, if adopted, what their effect will be on us. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors contain important information about us and our business and should be read in their entirety. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be not material could also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. Risks Related to Our Business Weak economic and real estate market conditions both nationally and in Florida and New York could continue to negatively impact our asset quality, financial condition and operating results. Since the end of 2007, we have been negatively impacted by a weak economy, high rates of unemployment, increased office and retail vacancy rates and lower commercial real estate values both nationally and in our primary markets, New York and Florida, all of which have resulted in a significant increase in our nonperforming assets and associated loan and real estate loss provisions and expenses to carry these assets. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and operating results are closely tied to the local economic conditions and commercial real estate values in New York and Florida. At December 31, 2012, our nonperforming assets amounted to $65.5 million, or 3.93% of our total assets, and were comprised of $9.6 million of nonaccrual loans, $36.3 million of restructured loans (TDRs) that were performing and paying in accordance with their revised terms but are also reported as nonaccrual due to regulatory guidance, $15.9 million of real estate acquired through foreclosure and $3.7 million of nonaccrual investment securities. At December 31, 2012, we also had another $20.1 million of accruing TDRs and another $9.2 million of performing loans for which there were concerns regarding the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms. All of the aforementioned loans, totaling $75.2 million, were rated as substandard loans at December 31, 2012. The timing and amount of the resolution and/or disposition of all these assets cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, our ability to complete foreclosure or other proceedings, if necessary, to acquire and sell certain collateral properties in many cases can be delayed by various factors outside of our control. We may be required to sell these, as well as other nonaccrual or problem assets that may arise in the future, at a loss compared to their current net carrying values. A sustained and prolonged economic and real estate downturn could continue to adversely affect the quality of our assets, further increase our nonperforming assets, credit losses, real estate losses and related carrying expenses, and also reduce the demand for our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 28 Table of Contents We may have higher loan and real estate losses than we have allowed for which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We maintain an allowance for loan losses and a valuation allowance for real estate losses that we believe reflect the amount of losses inherent in our loan and real estate owned portfolios at a specific point in time. The allowances may not be adequate to protect us against actual losses that we may incur. There is a risk that we may experience losses that could exceed the allowances we have set aside. The amount that we may realize from the sale of a collateral property is dependent upon the market value of the property at the time we are able to find a buyer and actually sell the asset. Such market value may not, at any given time, be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the defaulted loan. In determining the size of the allowances, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and the estimated market values of the underlying collateral properties and of real estate owned, which are discussed under the caption Critical Accounting Policies in this report. If our assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, we may have to increase these allowances or replenish them after chargeoffs by recording additional loss provisions. Furthermore, our regulators may require us to make additional provisions for loan and real estate losses after their periodic review of these portfolios and related allowances based solely on their judgments. All of the above could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We are subject to the risks and costs associated with owning real estate, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. From time to time, we need to foreclose on the properties that collateralize our mortgage loans that are in default as a means of repayment and may thereafter own and operate such properties, which expose us to risks and costs inherent in the ownership of real estate. Costs associated with the ownership of real estate (principally real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs) may exceed the rental income earned from the property, if any, and we may therefore have to advance additional funds to operate and or maintain the property in order protect our investment. Property taxes have increased substantially in recent years, and higher taxes may adversely affect our borrowers cash flows and our costs of operating foreclosed property as well as real estate values generally. Further, hazardous substances could be discovered on the properties and we may be required to remove the substances from and remediate the properties at our expense, which could be substantial. We may not have adequate remedies against the owners of the properties or other responsible parties and the remedies may involve substantial delay and expense to us and we may find it difficult to sell the affected properties and we may be forced to own the properties for an extended period of time. All of the above factors could also adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate, which increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate. This concentration increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio because the above loans are generally considered riskier than many other kinds of loans, like single family residential real estate loans, since these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to one borrower or groups of related borrowers and repayment of such loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate. Additionally, in our portfolio we have loans secured by vacant or substantially vacant properties as well as some vacant land, all of which typically do not have adequate or any income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment. A number of our borrowers also have more than one mortgage loan outstanding with us. Likewise, a number of these borrowers may also own other properties that are encumbered by separate mortgages from other lenders. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to the borrower may expose us to a greater risk of loss with respect to our otherwise performing loans with the same borrower. Furthermore, banking regulators continue to give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and banks with higher levels of these loans are expected to implement improved underwriting and risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as maintain higher levels of allowances for possible losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. 29 Table of Contents Regardless of the underwriting criteria we utilize, we may experience lending losses as a result of various factors beyond our control, including, among other things, changes in market and economic conditions affecting the value of our loan collateral and problems affecting the credit and business of our borrowers. Our ability to recover our investment in the mortgage loans we originate is ultimately dependent on the market value of the properties collateralizing such loans because many of the loans permit no recourse or limited recourse against the propertys owner. Even with personal recourse, successful collection is still difficult to achieve. In addition, our losses in connection with delinquent and foreclosed loans may be more pronounced because our commercial and multifamily real estate mortgage loans generally defer repayment of a substantial part of the original principal amount until maturity. All of the above factors could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The properties securing our loans are concentrated in New York and Florida, which increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio. The properties securing our loans are concentrated in New York and Florida (our primary lending markets). Additionally, we have and will continue to lend in geographical areas in both of these states and as well as other states that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped, which can be negatively impacted to a greater degree in an economic downturn. Properties securing our loans in these types of neighborhoods may be more susceptible to fluctuations in value than properties in more established areas. Political issues, including armed conflicts and acts of terrorism, may have an adverse impact on economic conditions of the country as a whole and may be more pronounced in specific geographic regions, which could negatively affect the market value of the mortgaged properties underlying our loans as well as the levels of rent and occupancy of income-producing properties. Since a large number of properties underlying our loans are located in New York City, we may be more vulnerable to the adverse impact of such occurrences than other institutions, which could have a significant negative impact on us. Florida is especially susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms and related flooding and wind damage, as well as other disasters such as the recent BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The Northeast can also be affected by hurricanes and other natural disasters as evidenced most recently by Hurricane Sandy. Such weather and environmental events can disrupt business, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economy, all of which may adversely affect the cash flows, values and marketability of properties that secure our loans. Furthermore, hurricane and other storm damage have increased the cost of property and casualty insurance premiums, especially in Florida. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage may be caused by the occurrence of such events. Such events could affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, could impair the value of the collateral securing our loans, and could cause significant property damage, thus increasing our expenses and/or reducing our revenues. All of the above factors could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or loan and real estate losses, all of which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Due to our concentration in commercial and multifamily real estate loans, the OCCs policies and INBs Formal Agreement with the OCC require us to strengthen our management and monitoring systems, which has increased our expenses and raised the amount of capital we must maintain. The OCC and other bank regulators require banks with concentrations of assets to have management, policies, procedures and systems appropriate to manage these risks, especially where the real estate loans are concentrated geographically or in particular lines of business. Commercial real estate (inclusive of multifamily properties, vacant land and loans on investor owned 1-4 family condominiums) comprised 99.9% of our total loan portfolio and 67% of our total assets, and represented 527% of our total stockholders equity at December 31, 2012. As discussed in the section Supervision and Regulation in this report, we are required to strengthen our management and monitoring systems and hold higher levels of capital as a result of the perceived risks of our concentration in commercial and multifamily real estate loans. We have and will continue to require increased management time and costs to monitor these assets in response to the OCCs requirements, including additional personnel and costs of consultants and other third parties, all of which could negatively impact our operating results. 30 Table of Contents Our loans are relatively short-term and we face the risk of borrowers being unable to refinance or pay their loans at maturity which could adversely affect our earnings, credit quality and liquidity. We have historically originated short-term real estate mortgage loans with balloon payments at maturity. Our borrowers are expected to have to refinance their loans at maturity or payoff the loans at maturity from other sources of cash or from sales of the underlying collateral property. We are therefore subject to the risks that our borrowers will not be able to repay us or refinance their loans due to adverse conditions in their businesses, unavailability of alternative financing, or an inability to timely sell the property securing our loan. These conditions also reduce the rate of payoffs on our loans, which may negatively impact our liquidity. In addition, any disruptions in the credit markets or other lenders diversification away from commercial real estate or multifamily lending as well as declines in real estate values may increase our delinquent and nonperforming loans, foreclosures and the potential for future losses. Problem assets also increase our expenses and take additional time and effort to manage. We may not be able to fully realize our deferred tax asset which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. At December 31, 2012, we had a deferred tax asset of $29.2 million. We perform quarterly reviews of the realizability of our deferred tax asset and have determined that a valuation allowance was not required at any time during the reporting periods in this report because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will be fully realized. Our ability to fully realize our deferred tax asset could be reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income from our operations and or tax planning strategies do not support the realization of our deferred tax asset. In addition, the amount of NOLs and certain other tax attributes realizable for income tax purposes may be reduced under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code by sales of our common stock. See the section Critical Accounting Policies for a further discussion of our deferred tax asset. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges on our investment in corporate securities which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. INB owns corporate security investments with a net carrying value of $3.7 million at December 31, 2012 that are classified as held to maturity and summarized in note 2 to the financial statements in this report. The estimated fair values of these securities are depressed due to the weakened economy and financial condition of a large number of the issuing banks as well as from restrictions that have been or can be placed on the payment of interest by regulatory agencies, which have severely reduced the demand for these securities and rendered their trading market inactive. From 2009 to 2012, we recorded other than temporary impairment (OTTI) charges totaling $4.2 million on these securities. There may be further impairment charges in the future on these investments, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Downgrades of the U.S. governments sovereign credit rating and in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by certain related institutions, agencies and instrumentalities could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict. In August 2011, S&P downgraded the U.S. long-term debt rating from AAA to AA+ and also similarly downgraded the credit ratings of certain long-term debt instruments issued by other U.S. government agencies linked to long-term U.S. debt. Such instruments are key assets on the balance sheets of many financial institutions, including our balance sheet which has approximately $400 million of such securities. These downgrades or future downgrades, and their impact on the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government agencies, could adversely affect the market value of such instruments, and could adversely impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. We cannot predict if, when or how these changes or future changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions. These or future rating downgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, and could exacerbate other risks described in this report. 31 Table of Contents Our business strategy may not be successful. Our business strategy is to attract deposits and originate commercial and multi-family real estate loans on a profitable basis. Our ability to execute this strategy depends on factors outside of our control, including the state of economic conditions generally and in our market areas in particular, as well as interest rate trends, the state of credit markets, loan demand, competition, government regulations, regulatory restrictions, capital needs and other factors. We may not be successful in maintaining or increasing the level of our loans and deposits at an acceptable risk or on profitable terms, while also managing the costs of resolving our nonperforming assets. Our business may not grow in the future, and it may not be profitable. While we seek continued organic growth when conditions are favorable, as our earnings and capital position improve, we may consider, with regulatory approval, the acquisition of other businesses or expansion into new product lines. We may not be able to identify such opportunities, nor adequately or profitably manage them. We depend on a small number of executive officers and other key employees to implement our business strategy and our business may suffer if we lose their services. Our success is dependent on the business expertise of a small number of executive officers and other key employees. Mr. Lowell Dansker, age 62, our Chairman, and Mr. Keith Olsen, age 59, President of INB, have historically made all of the underwriting and lending decisions for us. If Mr. Dansker or Mr. Olsen or any of our other executive officers or key employees (as disclosed in Item 1 of this report) were to become unavailable for any reason, our business may be adversely affected because of their skills and knowledge of the markets in which we operate, their years of real estate lending experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. To attract and retain qualified personnel to support our business, we offer various employee benefits, including an executive employment agreement for Mr. Dansker. We have a written management succession plan that identifies internal officers to perform executive officer functions in case of temporary disruptions due to such things as illnesses or leaves of absence. It contains procedures regarding the selection of permanent replacements, if any, for key officers. This plan may not be effective, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel may increase our hiring and retention costs, which could negatively affect our operating results. We face strong competition in our market areas. Our primary markets consist of New York and Florida, which are highly competitive and such competition may increase further. We experience competition in both lending and attracting deposits from other banks and nonbanks located within and outside our primary market areas, some of which are significantly larger institutions with greater resources, lower cost of funds or a more established market presence. Nonbank competitors for deposits and deposit-type accounts include savings associations, credit unions, securities firms, investment bankers, money market funds, life insurance companies and the mutual fund industry. For loans, we experience competition from other banks, savings associations, finance companies, mortgage bankers and brokers, insurance companies, credit card companies, credit unions, pension funds and securities firms. Because our business depends on our ability to attract deposits and originate loans profitably, our ability to efficiently compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success. External factors that may impact our ability to compete include changes in local economic conditions and commercial real estate values, changes in interest rates, regulatory actions that limit the rates we pay on our deposits to market rates, changes in the credit markets and funds available for lending generally, advances in technology, changes in government regulations and the consolidation of banks and thrifts within our marketplace. Our operating results could suffer if we are not able to successfully compete in these markets. We depend on brokers for our loan originations and any reduction in referrals could limit our ability to grow or maintain the size of our loan portfolio. We rely significantly on referrals from real estate mortgage brokers for our loan origination volume. If those referrals were to decline or not expand, other sources of loan originations may not be available to us. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity risks could negatively affect our operations and business. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, repayments of loans, or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. In addition to deposits, our primary funding sources include unsecured federal funds that we purchase from correspondent banks as well as secured advances, both short- and longer-term, that are available from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with the use of our investment securities and certain loans that can be pledged as collateral. Other sources of liquidity that may be available to us, but cannot be assured, include our ability to issue and sell debentures, preferred stock or common stock in public or private transactions. Our access to adequate amounts of funding sources on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets, adverse changes in the financial condition of our correspondent banks that supply us with federal funds, or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the credit markets. Our current level of liquidity sources may not be adequate, or may be adversely affected in the future, which may reduce the availability of funds to us. In February 2010, consistent with FRB requirements, we deferred our interest payments on our $56.7 million of outstanding trust preferred securities and suspended dividend payments on our $25 million of outstanding cumulative preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP program. Furthermore, the FRB has prohibited us from incurring any new indebtedness or paying dividends without their approval. All of the above could negatively impact our ability to raise new capital or new debt. Volatility in the capital and credit markets may negatively impact our business. Volatility in the capital and credit markets can produce downward pressure on stock prices and reduced credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial condition or performance. These factors could have material adverse effects on our ability to access capital or credit and on our business, financial condition and operating results. Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our earnings and we must continually identify and invest in mortgage loans or other instruments with rates of return above our cost of funds. As a financial institution, we are subject to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. A significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, which depends primarily on the generation of net interest income. Our net interest income is dependent on our interest rate spread, which is the difference between yields earned on our interest-earning assets and the rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. As a result, our success depends on our ability to invest a substantial percentage of our assets in mortgage loans with rates of return that exceed our cost of funds. We expect lower rates of return from our investment securities, especially our government securities and overnight investments, than from our loans. Regulatory requirements for greater liquidity may also adversely affect our profitability. Both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities are impacted by such external factors as our local economies, competition for loans and deposits, the state of the credit markets, government monetary policy and market interest rates. Additionally, as a result of competitive market conditions and lower pricing in originating loans, we have placed greater reliance on fixed-rate loan originations with somewhat longer maturities. Fluctuations in interest rates are difficult to predict and manage and, therefore, we may not be able to maintain a consistent positive interest rate spread. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings, our cost of funds, loan demand, and the value of our collateral and investment securities. For a further discussion of our management of interest rate risk, see the caption entitled Asset and Liability Management in this report. Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and our business. Our borrowed funds (exclusive of deposits) and related interest payable was approximately $63 million at December 31, 2012. This level of indebtedness could make it difficult for us to satisfy all of our obligations to the holders of our debt and could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing to fund our working capital requirements. 33 Table of Contents The inability to incur additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial condition by, among other things, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our competitors who may operate on a less leveraged basis. As a result, this may make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Reputational risk and social factors may negatively impact us. Our ability to attract and retain depositors and customers is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions of either or both of our business practices and financial condition. Adverse perceptions could damage our reputation to a level that could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining deposit accounts, accessing credit markets and increased regulatory scrutiny on our business. Borrower payment behaviors also affect us. To the extent that borrowers determine to stop paying on their loans where the financed properties market values are less than the amount of their loan, or otherwise, our costs and losses may increase. Adverse developments or perceptions regarding the business practices or financial condition of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also indirectly adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. All of the above factors may result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that may change or constrain the manner in which we engage with our customers and the products we offer and may also increase our litigation risk. If these risks were to materialize they could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Regulatory Risks We operate in a highly regulated industry and government regulations significantly affect our business. The banking industry is extensively regulated with regulations intended primarily to protect depositors. Regulations affect, among other things, our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, and asset allocations, operating practices, and growth and dividend policy. Regulations may limit the manner in which we may conduct our business, increase our operating and compliance costs and other expenses, reduce our revenues and impose higher capital and liquidity requirements on us, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. See the section Supervision and Regulation in this report for a further discussion. Our current operations and activities are subject to heightened regulatory oversight which may negatively impact our business and operating results. As discussed in greater detail in the section Supervision and Regulation in this report, IBC and INB are operating under formal written agreements with their respective primary regulators. As a result of these agreements, our operations, lending activities and capital levels are subject to heightened regulatory oversight, over and above the extensive regulation which normally applies to us under existing regulations, which already has and may continue to increase our expenses and negatively impact our business. In addition, failure to comply with these heightened requirements could lead to additional regulatory actions, expenses and other restrictions, including the possible sale, merger, liquidation or receivership of INB or IBC. IBC relies on cash dividends from INB to meet its obligations. IBC is a separate and distinct legal entity from INB. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company. In addition, IBCs right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors. Prior to January 2010, INB made cash dividend payments to IBC to fund the interest payments on IBCs outstanding debt and the cash dividend requirements on IBCs outstanding preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury. In January 2010, INBs primary regulator, the OCC, prohibited INB from paying any cash dividends to IBC. INB accordingly suspended its cash dividend payments. 34 Table of Contents Under its Formal Agreement with the OCC, INB may only make payments of dividends or capital distributions to IBC if: (a) INB is in compliance with its approved capital plan before and after the payment of any dividend; (b) INB is in compliance with 12 U.S.C. §§ 56 and 60; and (c) prior written determination of no supervisory objection by the OCC is received. IBCs inability to receive dividends from INB materially and adversely affects IBCs liquidity and its ability to service its debt, pay its other obligations, or pay cash dividends on its common or preferred stock, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. IBC is not paying dividends on its preferred stock or common stock and is deferring distributions on its trust preferred securities. In January 2010, IBC suspended dividend payments on its outstanding preferred and common stock and distributions on its trust preferred capital securities pursuant to the written request of its primary regulator. There can be no assurance that the payment of any such dividends or interest will resume in the future. The payment of dividends is generally limited to amounts available from current earnings. Furthermore, payments of cash dividends on our common stock, if any, will also be subject to the prior payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends and deferred distributions on our Series A Preferred Stock and trust preferred securities. Additionally, current and proposed regulatory requirements for increased capital and liquidity will limit our ability to pay dividends on our preferred and common stock and make distributions on our outstanding trust preferred securities. At December 31, 2012, we had $4.2 million of unpaid dividends owing on our preferred stock and $6.2 million of deferred distributions owing on our trust preferred securities. The failure to resume paying these obligations may adversely affect our business, including access to credit and capital markets. FDIC deposit insurance premiums have increased substantially and may increase further, which will adversely affect our operating results. Deposit insurance premiums may continue to remain at a high level and may increase further for all banks, including the possibility of additional special assessments. Our current level of FDIC insurance expense as well as any further increases thereto will adversely affect our operating results. We are subject to restrictions as a result of our participation in the U.S Treasurys Capital Purchase Program. In December 2008, we voluntarily applied for and were selected to participate in the U.S Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program and we are now subject to various restrictions many of which were imposed subsequent to participation as defined in the Program, including standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for as long as the Treasury holds our Series A Preferred Stock, or any common stock that may be issued to them pursuant to the warrant they hold. These standards generally apply to our CEO, CFO and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers and include (1) ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution; (2) require clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings, gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; (3) prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives; and (4) agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each senior executive. This deductibility limit on executive compensation, which currently only affects our Chairmans compensation, increases the overall after-tax cost of our compensation programs. Pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, further compensation restrictions, including significant limitations on incentive compensation and golden parachute payments, have been imposed on our most highly compensated employees, which may make it more difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified personnel, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Accounting, Systems and Internal Control Risks Changes in accounting standards may affect our performance. Our accounting policies and procedures are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and operating results. Almost annually, there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. 35 Table of Contents These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we and the rest of the industry record and report its financial condition and operating results. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has and continues to issue a large number of accounting standards that necessarily require all companies to exercise significant judgment and interpretation in the application of those standards. For example, banks now need to use significant judgment when assessing the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities sitting on their balance sheets even though market values can change rapidly and may not be representative due to the inactivity of certain markets. Furthermore, these judgments and estimates could lead to inaccuracy and/or incomparability of financial statements due to differing conclusions on the same facts and circumstances. Future changes in financial accounting and reporting standards, including marking all our assets and liabilities to market values, could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and even require us to restate prior period financial statements. The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition. We necessarily make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements. The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact our operating results and financial condition. For a further discussion, see the caption Critical Accounting Policies in this report. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may not allow us to be able to accurately report our financial condition, operating results or prevent fraud. We regularly review and update our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. We maintain controls and procedures to mitigate against risks such as processing system failures and errors, and customer or employee fraud. We maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls or are not insured against or are in excess of our insurance limits. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. A breach of information security could negatively affect our business. We depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, including over the internet. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, deposits and loans. We cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we have instituted. We also rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached, information can be lost or misappropriated and could result in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others. These costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The inability to keep pace with technological changes on our part could also have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Item 1B.
