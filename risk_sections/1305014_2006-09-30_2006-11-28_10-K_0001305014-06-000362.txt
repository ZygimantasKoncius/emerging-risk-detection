ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion of "risk factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in forward-looking statements and from historical trends. SEVERAL OF ASHLAND'S BUSINESSES ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE, AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS OR DECLINES IN DEMAND, PARTICULARLY FOR CERTAIN DURABLE GOODS, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. The profitability of Ashland is susceptible to downturns in the economy, particularly in those segments related to durable goods, including the housing, construction, automotive and marine industries. Both overall demand for Ashland's products and services and its profitability will likely change as a direct result of an economic recession, inflation, changes in hydrocarbon (and its derivatives) and other raw materials prices, or changes in governmental monetary or fiscal policies. ASHLAND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY REDEPLOY THE PROCEEDS OF THE MAP TRANSACTION IN A VALUE-CREATING MANNER. Ashland may not be able to successfully redeploy the MAP Transaction proceeds in a manner that will generate value for its shareholders. To the extent that the proceeds of the MAP Transaction are used for business acquisitions, there is a risk that the acquisition will fail to provide expected returns to Ashland's shareholders. In addition, the process of integrating acquired operations into Ashland's existing operations may result in unforeseen difficulties. Those difficulties might reduce Ashland's profitability and delay the expected benefits of integrating any acquisition. ASHLAND'S IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS SAP(TM) ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING ("ERP") PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND ASSOCIATED ADVERSE IMPACT ON OPERATING RESULTS. In 2004, Ashland initiated a multi-year ERP project that is expected to be implemented domestically and in most international locations to achieve increased efficiency and effectiveness in supply chain, financial and environmental, health and safety processes. In October 2005, Ashland successfully completed the implementation of the ERP system in Canada. In October 2006, this ERP system was successfully implemented for Valvoline's U.S. operations and certain corporate functions. While extensive planning is underway to support a smooth implementation of the ERP system, such implementations carry substantial risk, including the potential for business interruption and associated adverse impacts on operating results. 6 FAILURE OF ASHLAND TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION PROJECT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ASHLAND'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. Ashland has been undergoing a major process initiative designed to optimize its supply chain function. By integrating the supply chain function and creating more efficient, customer responsive processes including source-to-pay, plan-to-deliver and order-to-cash, Ashland can lower costs, while increasing service levels and customer satisfaction. The Supply Chain Optimization Project is, in part, dependent upon the successful execution of the ERP project discussed in the preceding risk factor. The implementation of the Supply Chain Optimization Project also carries substantial risk, including the potential for business interruption and associated adverse impacts on operating results. ASHLAND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS, WHICH MAY IMPAIR ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND REDUCE ITS PROFITABILITY. Rising and volatile raw material prices, especially those of hydrocarbon derivatives, may negatively impact Ashland's costs. Ashland is not always able to raise prices in response to such increased costs, and its ability to pass on the costs of such price increases is dependent upon market conditions. Therefore, such increases in costs could impair Ashland's competitive position in certain markets and reduce its profitability. ASHLAND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND HAS FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO, LIABILITIES FROM PENDING AND THREATENED CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS, WHICH COULD REDUCE ASHLAND'S CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY AND COULD IMPAIR ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION. There are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability and other environmental matters which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While these actions are being contested, their outcome is not predictable. In addition, Ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation ("Riley"), a former subsidiary of Ashland. Although Riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos-containing components provided by other companies. As a result of the transactions, Ashland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, these liabilities, which could reduce Ashland's cash flows and profitability and impair its financial condition. ASHLAND HAS INCURRED AND MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LIABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE ASHLAND'S PROFITABILITY. Ashland is subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety. These laws and regulations regulate discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated properties. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be substantial and may increase as applicable requirements become more stringent and new rules are implemented. If Ashland violates the requirements of these laws and regulations, it may be forced to pay substantial fines, to complete additional costly projects, or to modify or curtail its operations to limit contaminant emissions. Ashland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, substantially all of the environmental liabilities and other liabilities of Ashland and its subsidiaries. Ashland has investigated and remediated a number of its current and former properties. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland's ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. PROVISIONS OF ASHLAND'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS AND KENTUCKY LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS THAT SOME SHAREHOLDERS MAY CONSIDER DESIRABLE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ASHLAND'S STOCK PRICE. Provisions of Ashland's articles of incorporation and by-laws could make acquiring control of Ashland without the support of its Board of Directors difficult for a third party, even if the change of control might be beneficial to Ashland shareholders. Ashland's articles of incorporation and by-laws contain: - provisions relating to the classification, nomination and removal of its directors; 7 - provisions limiting the right of shareholders to call special meetings of its Board of Directors and shareholders; - provisions regulating the ability of its shareholders to bring matters for action at annual meetings of its shareholders; and - the authorization given to its Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. Ashland's articles of incorporation and the laws of Kentucky impose some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between Ashland and any beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of its outstanding common stock. The existence of these provisions may deprive shareholders of any opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price for Ashland common stock. The potential inability of Ashland shareholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for its common stock. ASHLAND MAY ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK WHOSE TERMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VOTING POWER OR VALUE OF ITS COMMON STOCK. Ashland's articles of incorporation authorizes it to issue, without the approval of its shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over its common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as its Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of Ashland's common stock. For example, Ashland could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of its directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences Ashland could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of its common stock. ITEM 1B.
