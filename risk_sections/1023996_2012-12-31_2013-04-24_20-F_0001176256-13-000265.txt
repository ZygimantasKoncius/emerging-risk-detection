D. Risk Factors – Risks Associated with the Mining Industry – The estimates of mineral reserves and forecasts of the production are subject to numerous uncertainties, and the production and recovery of reserve estimates appearing in the Annual Report may not be realized” for a discussion of the risks inherent in estimating reserves and production.Following 2012 drilling results, Richmont announced that scheduled technical work and permitting efforts would continue as planned in 2013 at Wasamac, however, no additional exploration and development activities would be undertaken on the asset. This decision was made following several months of project optimization studies, from which Richmont concluded that alternative scenarios did not currently offer a meaningful economic improvement in the current gold price environment, over the initial Preliminary Economic Assessment outlined in the Corporation’s March 28, 2012 press release.Geological SettingRegional GeologyThe Wasamac property is located within the Rouyn-Noranda mining district, in the Abitibi greenstone belt of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. The area consists mostly of felsic to mafic volcanic rocks of Archean age along with related dioritic sills which are concordant to the regional rock formations. These volcanic and intrusive rocks have generally been metamorphosed to the green schist facies.The Superior Province is the largest exposed Archean craton in the world that hosts several world class gold deposits. It has yielded nearly 300 million ounces of gold from hundreds of deposits since the beginning of the twentieth century. One prominent characteristic of all significant gold deposits in the Superior Province is their occurrence within or immediately adjacent to greenstone belts. Another characteristic is their occurrence within major tectonic zones which comprise a series of shear zones. The Superior Province is divided into four major subprovince types: volcano-plutonic, plutonic, metasedimentary and high grade gneiss. The boundaries of these subprovinces are either major dextral, transcurrent, east-striking faults or zones of structural and metamorphic transition.The greenstone belts which host the gold deposits occur as east-northeasterly trending ribbon domains in the volcano-plutonic terrains. They typically consist of mafic to ultramafic and felsic metavolcanics, interlayered with metasediments. The supracrustal rocks have been intruded by syn-volcanic plutons. Saturated and undersaturated felsic to mafic igneous rocks intruded into the greenstone belts in late Archean.The metamorphic grade of most of the present greenstone terrains ranges from sub-greenschist to greenschist facies in the center, to lower amphibolite facies at the margin. Amphibolite facies contact metamorphic aureoles occur around intrusions into the greenstones.Project GeologyVolcanic rocks of the Blake River Group which host the gold deposits are the principal Archean rock-types exposed in the study area. Rocks of the Blake River Group are bounded to the north by the Porcupine-Destor-Parfouru fault system and to the south by the Cadillac Fault. The Blake River Group is the youngest volcanic sequence in the Superior Province and forms a central volcanic complex which is characterized by cyclic bimodal andesite-rhyolite units of calc-alkaline and tholeiitic affinity. These units are underlain by the sedimentary rocks of the Timiskaming Group, which are themselves overlain by little deformed Proterozoic59 sedimentary rocks of the Cobalt Group along the south boundary. The volcanic rocks are intruded by two major intrusive rocks, mafic gabbro-diorite sills and stocks that are either synvolcanic or clearly post-tectonic. All lithologies, except for the syenites, are folded and metamorphosed.Two large granitic bodies are located just north of the Wasamac property: the Flavrian and the Powell batholiths. These two bodies cross-cut the volcanic rocks and are located within the general axis of the Blake River Group syncline. Elsewhere on the property, diabase dykes of Proterozoic age and lamprophyre dykes are also found.The property can be subdivided into two distinct volcanic sequences; the southeastern portion is characterized by massive mafic to intermediate flows, while the northern portion is underlain by an intercalation of mafic volcanic flows, felsic tuffs and brecciated rhyolite. These two volcanic sequences are separated by a subsidiary fault of the Larder Lake-Cadillac tectonic zone, called the Wasa shear zone, which crosses the entire length of the property from east to west.Elsewhere on the property, several small mafic intrusive bodies composed of gabbro and diorite can be found. These intrusive bodies vary in size and seem to be generally concordant with the regional stratigraphy which runs east-west.Below the Proterozoic Cobalt sediments, just south of the Wasamac property, the Larder Lake-Cadillac Fault cuts the Archean rocks and separates the rocks of the Blake River Group to the north with the sedimentary rocks of the Timiskaming Group to the south. Beside this major structure, the Archean rocks are also affected by two families of very different faults, one of which is related to the Wasa shear zone, and the other to the Horne fault. Like the regional structures, these faults and shear zones are nearly striking east-west. The Wasa shear zone is a reverse fault with a north dipping trend and is strongly hydrothermally altered on the Wasamac property. Most of the gold mineralization found on the property to date is related to the Wasa shear zone.Only minor folding has been observed on the property. Schistosity varies between south-east to north-east with a northern dip of about 55 degrees and corresponds to regional schistosity. The stratigraphic high, from pillows observation, is towards the north.MineralizationThe Wasa shear zone runs through the centre of the property in an east-west fashion. This shear zone, which trends at an azimuth of 265°, has a 50-60° dip to the north and a maximum thickness of 80 metres. To the west, the shear zone splits into two separate branches and becomes thinner, while to the east, the shear zone weakens as well and displays an average thickness of 25 metres. This shear zone is characterized by the development of a strong mylonitic fabric and an intense hydrothermal alteration which totally destroyed the primary structures and textures of the protolith. Mineral assemblages of rocks within the shear zone consist of chlorite, carbonate, hematite, albite and sericite in the middle of the zone. Gold is associated with a dissemination of fine pyrite in the altered portions of the shear zone.The Wasa shear zone, which has been well drilled over its entire length, does not outcrop anywhere on surface.During the production era, two gold bearing zones were mined, namely the Main Zone and the East N°1 Zone (now Zone 1), while two other less significant zones, the East N°2 (now Zone 2) and the MacWin zones, have only been delimited by diamond drilling.Main Zone: Originally discovered in 1944 through surface drilling, the Main Zone can be described as a well laminated mineralized zone. It is located near the centre of the property, within the Wasa Shear and high grade parts displays true widths of 10-15 metres (up to 25 metres locally) over a strike length of 400 metres. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz, carbonate, sericite, albite, pyrite and chlorite inside the shear zone. Visible gold is rare and strong gold assays are generally associated with high silica content and a lot of fine grained pyrite. If the entire mineralized zone is considered, i.e. including lower grade parts, the width of the mineralized zone can reach over 50 metres.60 Zone 1: Located some 400 metres east of the Main Zone, this zone has a similar mineralogical assemblage with the Main Zone. The high grade part displays true widths of 4.5 to 7.5 metres over a strike length of 150 metres. During the last phase of production work, underground development work was undertaken in an effort to mine this gold bearing lens but only limited tonnage was finally extracted. The thickness of the whole mineralized envelop is larger, up to 20 metres. Zone 2: In September of 1944, surface drilling work intersected another gold bearing structure some 800 metres east of the Main Zone. The higher grade part of this zone has an average thickness of 3 to 6 metres over a strike length of 225 metres. The zone was partially developed from underground but no production was recorded. This mineralized zone is located in the upper part of the shear zone, near the hanging wall. Zone 3: This mineralization was intersected with the 2002-2004 drilling. It is located in the lower part of the shear zone, near the footwall, below the MacWin Zone. Zone 4: This new mineralized zone was discovered with the exploration drilling conducted in 2012. This small mineralized zone was intersected at the eastern edge of the property, it extends onto the neighboring Globex Mining Enterprises claim. MacWin Zone: Formerly known as the Wingate Zone, this zone was found in 1945 near the eastern property boundary and is also located within the Wasa shear zone. Wildcat Zone: Located approximately 300 metres south of the Main Zone, the Wildcat Zone was the first gold showing to be discovered on the property (1936). This gold bearing zone consists of a carbonate altered zone at the margins of a gabbroic unit. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz carbonate veinlets containing fine grained pyrite. The pyrite mineralization is also present throughout the altered halo as disseminations. This zone, which has been interpreted as being erratic, was investigated through underground development work in 1937, but operations ceased a year later due to lower than expected gold grades. Further surface drilling was subsequently completed in 1944, but efforts failed to improve the grade. The Wildcat shaft was later used as a ventilation raise. In 1981, Exploration Long Lac completed 18 holes over 1,562 m. These vertical holes showed a possible extension of the mineralization to the south-east. Also, RMR and Richmont previous drilling realized in this area showed a possible extension of the mineralized structure to the south-west. Drilling Previous Exploration Work A considerable amount of exploration and development work was carried out on the Wasamac property since the discovery of the first gold-bearing veins. Successive underground developments have allowed for the discovery of additional mineralization along the Wasa Shear during the years the Main Zone was exploited. The most recent exploration programs conducted on the Wasamac property were completed between 2002 and 2012 by the Corporation. In 2002, in order to keep the property in good standing, the Corporation drilled a 420 metre surface hole on the property which targeted the down plunge extension of Zone 2. Drill hole WS-02-01 successfully intersected mineralization which yielded 4.15 g/t Au over a true width of 6.8 m. In light of this positive result, the Corporation made the decision to follow up with a substantial surface drilling program in 2003, during which a total of 9,475 metres of surface diamond drilling was completed in 15 drill holes. 61 All of the drilling successfully intersected the Wasa shear zone at depth which demonstrates excellent continuity. Nine (9) drill holes from this program returned assay values above 4 g/t Au from the Wasa Shear intersections. This surface drilling program was continued in 2004, during which 3,859 m of drilling were completed. One hole began in 2005 and was only completed in 2006. Hole WS-05-21, over 745 m, cut the Wasa shear zone but returned only low gold values (0.91 g/t over 4.1 m). In 2007, 2 holes over a total of 435 m were done on the west extension of the Wildcat Zone. Hole WS-07-22 cut the Wildcat structure with a gold intercept of 1.39 g/t over 6.6 m. In 2008-2009, 3 exploration holes were done to test geophysical anomalies that could indicate parallel structure to the Wasa shear zone. Alteration zones were cut but returned no significant gold value. In 2010, as a result of the favourable gold price, Richmont decided to restart work on the Wasamac property. Richmont began a 10,000 m drilling program on this property in May 2010, with the goal to evaluate the potential for an underground bulk mining operation. Subsequent to favorable results being obtained, the 2010 drilling program was extended to 20,000 m. Drilling was planned using a hole spacing of about 75 metres on a vertical longitudinal section. Drilling was concentrated mainly on Zone 2 with some holes drilled into Zone 1. Three diamond drill rigs were used on the property for the 2010 program. Every hole was done on NQ core diameter from section 50W to 600E. Of the 33 holes completed, 31 reached their target. Holes WS-10-35 and WS-10-54 were stopped before completion, the first one due to drilling material stuck in the hole, and the second due to a too large deviation. Three to four diamond drill rigs were used on the property for the 2011 program. Every hole was done NQ core diameter. A total of 78 holes were completed (11 were stopped and redone due to bad deviations) and 4 were not finished by the end of 2011. A total of approximately 52,000 metres were drilled on the Wasamac property in 2011. Main results of the 2011 drilling program were: Confirmed the mineralization at the bottom of the Main Zone with a large thickness in the western portion, where gold mineralization is also found in the footwall of the shear zone; Widened Zone 2 at depth to the west and demonstrated its junction with Zone 1. Indicated also that Zone 2 remains open at depth; Better defined Zone 3, which has now been cut by more than 20 holes; Indicated that Zone 3 remains open at depth. 2012 Drilling Several diamond drill rigs were also used on the property during the 2012 drilling program. Always with a diameter NQ, 87 exploration wells were drilled for a total of 42,809 metres. Most of these holes were drilled on private land, and agreements were reached with the respective owners. Also, to minimize disturbance to area residents, anti-noise walls were used and drilling schedules were adapted. Main results of the 2012 drilling program were: Main Zone resources at depth now account for almost all of the indicated category. Main Zone remains open at the east and at depth. Zone 3 mineralization is now better defined, and it is still partly open at depth. 62 A fourth mineralized zone was intersected at the eastern edge of the property. This area continues into part on the neighboring property. Silver grades were systematically assayed with gold. Also, samples of all the available mineralized intersections were also re-assayed for silver. The silver has now been included in the new resource estimate. Nearly 45% of the Wasamac resources are now in the measured and indicated resource categories. More extensive metallurgical tests were initiated on composite samples of drill core for the 4 main mineralized zones of the property. Results will be available in 2013. Over twenty geotechnical drill holes were also carried out to verify the quality of the rock in the crown pillar and the hanging wall of the Main Zone and Zone 1. A large diameter drilling was also carried out to intersect existing developments of the former Wasamac mine and serve as dewatering well. All applications for permits and certificates of authorization have been completed to begin the excavation of an exploration ramp and dewatering of the old mine. On November 29, 2012, Richmont Mines announced that, given the current market conditions and gold price and as alternative mining scenarios considered showed no improvement over the results of the PEA, that exploration work was being suspended. In 2012, 13 holes totaling 10,136 metres were completed on 5 claims of the adjoining property that had been optioned from Globex Mining Enterprises. Only the small mineralized zone 4, at the edge of the two properties, was intersected. With these poor results and the decision to suspend exploration on the Wasamac property, Richmont Mines decided to terminate the option agreement with Globex, with whom it had the right to acquire 100% of these 5 claims. Under the terms of the agreement, Richmont Mines could abandon its right to exercise the option on these 5 claims at any time by giving a written notice to Globex to this purpose, 30 days before the date of withdrawal. After fulfilling of this obligation, the Corporation had no additional obligation to Globex. Sampling There is not a lot of information available about the rock sampling methods used underground, either for core drilling or wall sampling, from when the Wasamac Mine was in operation. Since 2002, core description has been performed by the Corporation’s geological staff according to the Corporation’s standards. The Corporation’s geologists are members in good standing of the OGQ (Ordre des Géologues du Québec) or the OIQ (Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec). Since 2010, logging has been done on the Francoeur minesite. The data introduced in the logging software was: Log header, hole location and parameters, surveys; Descriptions of the main and sub geological units with their location; Mineralized zones with their mineralogy, attitude, thickness; and Structures, alterations and RQD (Rock Quality Designation). Selected mineralized intervals were cut in half with a saw blade, one half being kept as a reference in core boxes, the other half being sent to Expert Laboratory in Rouyn-Noranda for gold grade determination. Transportation of samples to the laboratory was done by Richmont Mines’ personnel. The assay results and core descriptions were collected and put into sets of interpreted sections helping the geological staff to interpret and to plan the drilling. 63 The core boxes were marked with aluminium tags and moved to permanent storage in steel core-racks on the Francoeur minesite. Since 2003, most of the split cores left in core-boxes have been stored at the Francoeur Mine and remain available if other tests (gravimetric, metallogenic or petrographic studies) are needed. Similarly, since 2009, rejects and pulps from the laboratory have been sent back to the Francoeur minesite. Assays We do not have any details about the analytical procedure used by laboratories before 2002. During the 2002-04 surface drilling programs, diamond drill cores were logged and split at the Corporation’s core logging facility. Samples from one half of the cores were tagged and bagged and delivered directly to the Techni-Lab S.G.B. Abitibi Inc. assay office in Ste-Germaine-Boulé, QC (Techni-Lab). The other half remained in the appropriate core boxes for future verification. Techni-Lab follows several procedures when batches of samples are received: Sample Preparation The samples are counted and classified. A project list is created and the sample identification numbers are compared with the order form provided by the client. Moreover, each sample is allocated two identification tags, one for the pulp and the other for the reject. 1. Samples are classified by order of priority and placed in cake tins (4 rows of 12 tins); 2. Wet samples are dried in an oven at 60° C for one hour; 3. Bags to be used in the sampling process are allocated the project number and the sample ID; 4. Each sample is crushed at -2 mm. The sample is then homogenized and "reduced" after several cycles in a "Riffle Jones" splitter to retain a 250 g portion; and 5. This portion is then pulverized at 80% passing -200 meshes during 3 minutes in a ring pulveriser. A form is filled and bags of pulp are numbered accordingly. A set of 24 crucibles, including a blank, a duplicate and a standard, is prepared. The crucibles are filled with 115 g of flux and a teaspoon of flour. A portion of the pulp is weighed (30 g) and added to the flux in the crucible. The content of each crucible is then homogenised. 1. A 30 gram pulp sample is taken for analysis; 2. Lead collection of the sample with a flux to obtain a lead button; 3. Cupellation of the lead button to free the precious metal bead; 4. Dissolution of the bead in "Aqua Regia"; 5. Measurement of the gold content by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS); and 6. If the gold content is higher than 10,000 ppb, a second 30 gram pulp sample is taken following lead collection and cupellation but the measurement of the gold content is performed using gravimetry instead of AAS. In 2011 and 2012, all the samples were sent to Expert Laboratory in Rouyn-Noranda. Nearly 20% of pulps and rejects from the mineralized zone were re-assayed by the laboratory Techni-Lab in Ste-Germaine-Boulé. The sampling and assaying procedures of Expert Laboratory are: 64 Sample Preparation 1. Receiving Samples Upon receipt, samples are placed in numerical order and compared with the client packing list to verify receipt of all samples. If the client does not provide a packing list with the shipment, one will be prepared by the person unpacking the samples. If the samples received do not correspond to the client list, the client will be notified. 2. Sample Preparation Samples are dried if necessary and then reduced to -1/4 inch with a jaw crusher. The jaw crusher is cleaned with compressed air between samples and barren material between sample batches. The sample is then reduced to 90% -10 mesh with a rolls crusher. The rolls crusher is cleaned between samples with a wire brush and compressed air and barren material between sample batches. The first sample of each sample batch is screened at 10 mesh to determine that 90% passes 10 mesh. Should 90% not pass, the roll crusher is adjusted and another test is done. Screen test results are recorded in the log book provided for this purpose. The sample is then riffled using a Jones type riffle to approximately 300 g. Excess material is stored for the client as a crusher reject. The 300 g portion is pulverized to 90% -200 mesh in a ring and puck type pulverizer, the pulverizer is cleaned between samples with compressed air and silica sand between batches. The first sample of each batch is screened at 200 mesh to determine that 90% passes 200 mesh. Should 90% not pass, the pulverizing time is increased and another test is done. Screen test results are recorded in the log book provided for this purpose. Gold Fire Assay Geochem A 29.166 g sample is weighed in a crucible that has been previously charged with approximately 130 g of flux. The sample is then mixed and 1mg of silver nitrate is added. The sample is then fused at 1,800 F for approximately 45 minutes. The sample is then poured into a conical mold and allowed to cool; after cooling, the slag is broken off and the lead button weighing 25-30 g is recovered. This lead button is then cupelled at 1,600 F until all the lead is oxidized. After cooling, the dore bead is placed in a 12 X 75 mm test tube. 0.2 ml of 1:1 nitric acid is added and allowed to react in a water bath for 30 minutes; 0.3 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid is then added and allowed to react in the water bath for 30 minutes. The sample is then removed from the water bath and 4.5 ml of distilled water is added. The sample is thoroughly mixed, allowed to settle and the gold is determined by atomic absorption. Each furnace batch comprises 28 samples that include a reagent blank and gold standard. Crucibles are not reused until the result of the sample that was previously in each crucible has been obtained. Crucibles that have had gold values of 200 PPB are discarded. The lower detection limit is 5 PPB and samples assaying over 1,000 PPB are checked gravimetrically. Gold Fire Assay Gravimetric A 29.166 g sample is weighed into a crucible that has been previously charged with approximately 130 g of flux. The sample is then mixed and 2mg of silver nitrate is added. The sample is then fused at 1,800 F for approximately 45 minutes. The sample is then poured in a conical mold and allowed to cool, after cooling, the slag is broken off and the lead button weighing 25-30 g is recovered. This lead button is then cupelled at 1,600 F until all the lead is oxidized. After cooling, the dore bead is flattened with a hammer and placed in a porcelain parting cup. The cup is filled with 1:7 nitric acid and heated to dissolve the silver. When the reaction appears to be finished, a drop of concentrated nitric acid is added and the sample is observed to ensure there is no further action. The gold bead is then washed several times with hot distilled water, dried, annealed, cooled and weighed. 65 Each furnace batch comprises 28 samples that include a reagent blank and gold standard. Crucibles are not reused until we have obtained the result of the sample that was previously in each crucible. Crucibles that have had gold values of 3.00 g/t are discarded. The lower detection limit is 0.03 g/t and there is no upper limit. All values over 3.00 g/t are verified before reporting. Quality Control For the 2011 and 2012 drilling program, a QA/QC procedure was followed. A certified standard from Rocklabs and a blank was inserted in every batch of 20 samples sent to Expert Laboratory. Security of Samples The samples are prepared in the exploration core shack located on the Francoeur Mine site where access is limited to the exploration staff. The samples are transported to the laboratory by the staff of Richmont. Mineralization Identified by Zone Crown Pillar: Mineralization which is located in the first 100 metres below surface. Most of this material is above the old mine in the Main Zone and in the top of zones 1 and 2. Main Zone: Located at the bottom of the old mine, this area was only partly developed and almost not mined. The mineralized zone has a dimension of about 300 metres x 300 metres and an average horizontal thickness of 30 metres. Zone 1: This zone extends from surface to –700 metres with a lateral extension of about 200 metres and an average horizontal thickness of 16 metres. It was partly developed and mined in the upper part. It joins the west part of Zone 2 at depth. Zone 2: This mineralized zone extends from surface to –1,000 metres and spans up to 400 metres laterally with an average horizontal thickness of 13 metres. It remains partly open at depth. Zone 3: This zone has now been tested with more than 25 drill holes. It extends from an elevation of –200 metres to –600 metres, continues laterally over 350 metres, and has an average horizontal thickness of 11 metres. This zone remains partly open at depth. 4.2 Monique, Quebec, Canada Location and Property Description The Monique property is located 25 km east of Val-d’Or, in the province of Quebec. The property is located approximately 10 km east of the Beaufor Mine and 50 km from the Corporation’s Camflo Mill. The property can be reached from Rouyn-Noranda via Highway 117 to the town of Val-d’Or, and then by a secondary road that leads directly to the property. The Monique property consists of 18 mining claims which represent a total area of 538.7 hectares. On December 21, 2010, the Corporation signed an option agreement with SOQUEM Inc. (“SOQUEM”) to acquire the remaining 19% interest of the Monique property. Under terms of the option agreement with SOQUEM, Richmont Mines paid an amount of $350 thousand upon signing the Agreement, and completed exploration work in the amount of more than $400 thousand before February 28, 2011, and acquired the residual 19% interest of the Monique property. Richmont Mines will grant a 0.38% NSR (Net Smelter Return) royalty to SOQUEM in the event that the property reaches commercial production. Similarly, Richmont Mines will assume the royalty obligations that exist on 8 out of the property’s 18 claims, payable to Exploration Concorde Ltd., equal to 5% net profit interest. 66 Gold mineralization on the Monique property is mainly associated with three deformation zones that cross the Property with an orientation of 280° and a 75° - 80° dip to the north. Gold mineralization is defined by a network of quartz/tourmaline/carbonate veins and veinlets, measuring 1 cm - 10 cm, with disseminated sulphides in the altered wall rocks. Free gold is observed frequently in the veins. A total of 12 gold zones have been observed on the Property over the years, the most promising being the A, B, G and J zones. In 2011, Richmont completed an 8,117 metre exploration drill program on the G and J zones of the Monique project. Results obtained from the G Zone include 2.18 g/t Au over 6.69 metres and 2.47 g/t Au over 6.21 metres (true width), and results obtained from the J Zone include 6.92 g/t Au over 3.30 metres, 3.24 g/t Au over 6.21 metres, and 2.88 g/t Au over 9.16 metres (true width). Environmental Obligations and Permits A closure plan was developed in conjunction with Roche Ltd, Consulting Group, that was submitted to the Ministère des Ressources naturelles on March 18, 2013. Financial guarantees will be submitted following the approval of the plan. Work Completed in 2012 The Corporation obtained the required approval to complete a bulk sample during 2013. If the bulk sampling phase is successful, a reserve calculation will be completed and open pit mining of the G and J zones would begin. The material will be treated at Richmont’s Camflo Mill.

Gold prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, including expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, exchange rates (specifically the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies), interest rates, global and regional political and economic crises and governmental policies with respect to gold holdings by a nation’s central bank. The demand and supply of gold usually affect gold prices but not necessarily in the same manner as supply and demand affect the prices of other commodities. The whole of gold available for sale includes a combination of mine production, stock and gold bullion held by governments, public and private financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. As the amounts produced in any single year account for a small portion of the total available supply of gold, normal variations in current production do not have a significant impact on the supply of gold or on its price. The following table sets out the annual average gold price (London PM fix) in U.S. over the past five years: Exchange (US$) rate1 (CAN$) 2008 872 1.07 933 2009 972 1.14 1,108 2010 1,225 1.03 1,262 2011 1,572 0.99 1,556 2012 1,669 1.00 1,669 As at April 19, 2013 1,406 1.03 1,448 1 Source: Bank of Canada Gold can be easily sold on numerous markets throughout the world and it is not difficult to ascertain its market price at any particular time. Richmont Mines is not dependent upon the sale of its gold to any one customer because of the large number of available gold purchasers. Richmont Mines may occasionally use put and call options on gold, and forward sales contracts on gold and U.S. dollars. All such contracts are previously approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors. Gold bars are carried between the mills and the refinery by commercial armoured truck. These bars are refined at the Royal Canadian Mint of Ottawa refinery under a service contract at competitive rates. Refined metal is sold on the spot market to commercial bullion dealers (or under forward sales contracts if previously approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors). As at December 31, 2012, Richmont Mines had not entered into any gold derivatives contracts. Governmental Regulation (Environment) Richmont Mines’ principal operations are the production of gold from mining development, extraction and processing of minerals, and mining exploration to maintain and increase its ore reserves. These operations are subject to various levels of control and strict government regulations, such as laws and regulations with respect to activities related to natural resources and the protection of the environment. Environmental protection legislation applicable to the Canadian mining industry mandates high standards for the reduction or elimination of emissions, deposits, and issuance or release into the environment of contaminants caused by the extraction or processing of ore. In addition, certificates of authorization must be obtained in advance for the construction and commercial operation of a mine, plant, concentrator or refinery, since such types of operations that are specific to the mining industry may result in emissions, deposits, issuance or release of contaminants into the environment or may affect the quality of the environment. 70 Quebec & Ontario Provincial legislation in Quebec and Ontario in mining matters contemplates the acquisition and ownership of mining titles, safety standards, royalties and mining taxes. The Mining Act provides for the rehabilitation and restoration of lands affected by mining activities. In Ontario, approval for any plan for the rehabilitation and restoration of land affected by a Corporation’s operations is given by the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (“MNDM”), while in Quebec it is given by the MRN. Corporations must comply with the plan and provide a financial guarantee to that effect. In Quebec, when a corporation commences mining operations, it must submit its rehabilitation and closure plan before the beginning of its activities. In Ontario, the plan must be approved before the beginning of commercial production; moreover, a local public consultation must also be held. The Ministries may enjoin a corporation who has already ceased its mining operations on a particular site to perform the rehabilitation and restoration work required by the presence of tailings. If the Corporation does not comply with such requirements, the MRN and the MNDM may have the rehabilitation and restoration work executed by a third party, at the Corporation’s cost. Richmont Mines does not foresee any specific difficulty in meeting the requirements under the Mining Act (Quebec) and the Mining Act (Ontario). Richmont Mines holds certificates of authorization issued by the Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs (the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, the “MDDEFP”) with respect to its mining operations in Quebec (Beaufor Mine, Francoeur Mine, Monique project and Camflo Mill) and by the Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment for its Island Gold Mine, located in Ontario.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS The discussion and analysis of the operating results and financial position of the Corporation for the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 should be read in conjunction with the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Annual Report. Notice should also be taken of the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 1 of this Annual Report, in particular with respect to trend and other forward looking information and disclosure regarding the Corporation’s contractual obligations. The preparation of financial statements involves making estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. The items most dependent on the use of estimates include the useful life of assets, amortization and depletion calculations based on proven and probable reserves, and the calculation of asset retirement obligations as well as future income and mining taxes. Consequently, future results may differ from these estimates. 71 On January 1st 2011, the Corporation has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board. The impacts of this transition are presented in the Corporation’s December 31, 2011 consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts presented herein are based on IFRS. Previously, the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“Canadian GAAP”). At that time, reference was made to notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation included in the Annual Report for a discussion of the material differences between Canadian GAAP and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), and their effect on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS are not comparable in all respects with financial statements that are prepared in accordance with either Canadian GAAP or with US GAAP. A. Operating Results Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 and year ended December 31, 2010 (all dollar amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated except for share and per ounce data). Overview Gold Prices The gold market remained strong in 2012 as the average price rose to approximately US$1,669 per ounce from an average price of US$1,572 in 2011, and US$1,225 in 2010. Gold began 2012 with an average of US$1,656 for January, a level that was 5% above the 2011 average price per ounce of US$1,572. The monthly average gold price declined to a low of US$1,586 in May then increased progressively throughout the year, reaching an average monthly high of US$1,747 for October 2012, before declining slightly to end the year at an average monthly price of US$1,689 for December. The main factors that are expected to continue to have a positive influence on the future price of gold include: Continued demand for gold ETF; Non-hedging and less aggressive hedging policies of producers; Demand levels that exceed the industry’s annual production; Uncertainty around governmental fiscal issues in North America and Europe; Ongoing geopolitical instability. Production Richmont currently produces gold at the Island Gold Mine in Ontario and at the Beaufor Mine in Quebec. Gold sales from these two operations totalled 60,741 ounces in 2012, compared to 76,143 ounces sold in 2011, with the shortfall primarily attributable to lower head grades and compared to 68,123 ounces in 2010. Including 5,202 ounces of gold sold from the Francoeur Mine that was closed on November 30, 2012, the Corporation’s gold sales were 65,943 ounces in 2012, in line with Richmont’s revised production guidance of approximately 65,000 ounces of gold. The Island Gold Mine generated gold sales of 41,686 ounces in 2012, in line with its production objective of 40,000 to 45,000 ounces, but below the 49,196 ounces of gold sold in 2011, which was a record for this operation. As of December 31, 2012, the Island Gold Mine had Proven and Probable reserves of 141,456 ounces 72 of gold, which translates into a replacement of 27% of its 2012 annual production. In 2011, gold sales from this mine increased 7% over 2010 levels, were at the high end of its 2011 production objective of 45,000 to 50,000 ounces of gold, and were a record for this mine. The Beaufor Mine, which has been in commercial production since 1996, generated gold sales of 19,055 ounces in 2012, below its targeted production range of 20,000 to 25,000 ounces in 2012. This production level was also below this mine’s 2011 gold sales of 26,947 ounces, a shortfall that is attributable to the year-over-year decline in average head grade to 5.19 g/t Au in 2012 from 8.45 g/t Au in 2011. While annual production decreased, definition drilling completed at the Beaufor Mine during 2012 successfully enabled this operation to replace its annual production. Proven and Probable reserves as of December 31, 2012 at the Beaufor Mine were 39,114 ounces of gold versus 38,331 ounces of gold at the end of 2011. Sales of gold ounces from Beaufor increased 21% year-over-year in 2011, primarily as a result of a notable improvement in recovered grade to 8.31 g/t Au from 6.60 g/t Au in the prior year. Investments Richmont invested $37.9 million in the ongoing development of its assets in 2012, up from $31.7 million in 2011. The notable year-over-year increase reflects the advancement of the underground exploration drift at the Island Gold Mine to improve access for deep exploration drilling below the mine’s current infrastructure. The level of increased investment similarly reflects the development of the ramp to access the W Zone, a near-surface zone located on the Beaufor Mine property. An additional $2.9 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2012, up from $0.9 million in 2011. The 2011 investment level of $31.7 million represented a notable increase over the $16.8 million investment level of 2010. This variance primarily reflects that a total of 18,910 metres of development and definition drilling were completed during 2011 at the Francoeur Mine, versus a total of 2,902 metres during 2010. Capital expenditures at the Island Gold Mine in 2011 included ongoing development costs, and the refurbishment and acquisition of equipment. Capital expenditures at the Beaufor Mine in 2011 included the construction of a new emergency escape exit from level 12 of the mine to surface, while expenditures of $3.5 million at the W Zone reflected advanced exploration activities and the start of work on the ramp portal. An additional $0.9 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2011, versus $0.5 million in 2010. Summary of Operational and Financial Results Net loss in 2012 was ($45.0 million) or ($1.28) per share, compared to net earnings in 2011 of $25.9 million, or $0.81 per share and net earnings of $9.3 million, or $0.33 per share in 2010. The cash and cash equivalent balance was $59.8 million at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $3.7 million over the $63.5 million at December 31, 2011. The cash and cash equivalent balance was $40.0 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2012, Richmont had working capital of $54.3 million compared with $68.7 million at December 31, 2011 and $43.9 million at December 31, 2010. 73 Change to accounting policies New Accounting Pronouncement During the year, the Corporation early adopted the amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements from the Annual Improvements 2009-2011. These amendments to IAS 1 are effective for annual period beginning on or after January 1st, 2013 and clarify that the requirements for comparative information provided beyond minimum requirements should be presented in accordance with IFRS. Future Accounting Pronouncements At the date of authorization of these consolidated financial statements, new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Corporation. Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements not yet effective will be adopted in the Corporation’s accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Corporation’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements The Amendments to IAS 1 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012 and require entities to group items presented in other comprehensive income (OCI) into those that, in accordance with other IFRSs, will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met. The existing option to present items of OCI either before tax or net of tax remains unchanged; however, if the items are presented before tax, then the amendments to IAS 1 require the tax related to each of the two groups of OCI to be shown separately. Management does not anticipate a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements from these Amendments. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) in its entirety with IFRS 9. To date, the chapters dealing with recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities have been issued. These chapters are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015. Chapters dealing with impairment methodology and hedge accounting are still being developed. Further, in November 2012, the IASB published an exposure draft in order to made limited modifications to IFRS 9’s financial asset classification model to address application issues. Management has not yet assess the impact of this new standard on the consolidated financial statements. However, Management does not expect to implement IFRS 9 until all of its chapters have been published and the impact of all resulting changes can be comprehensively assessed. Consolidation Standards A package of new consolidation standards is effective for annual periods beginning or after January 1, 2013. Information on these new standards is presented below. Management has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of these new and revised standards on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS 10) IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27) and SIC 12 Consolidation - Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 revises the definition of control and provides extensive new guidance on its application. These new requirements have the potential to affect which of the Corporation’s investees are considered to be subsidiaries and therefore change the scope of consolidation. However, the requirements on 74 consolidation procedures, accounting for changes in non-controlling interests and accounting for loss of control of a subsidiary remain the same. Management’s provisional analysis is that IFRS 10 will not change the classification (as subsidiaries or otherwise) of any of the existing investees at December 31, 2012. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (IFRS 11) IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures (IAS 31). It aligns more closely the accounting by the investors with their rights and obligations relating to the joint arrangement. In addition, IAS 31's option of using proportionate consolidation for joint ventures has been eliminated. IFRS 11 now requires the use of the equity accounting method, which is currently used for investments in associates. Management does not anticipate a material impact on the consolidated financial statements from these Amendments. IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (IFRS 12) IFRS 12 integrates and makes consistent the disclosure requirements for various types of investments, including unconsolidated structured entities. It introduces new disclosure requirements about the risks to which an entity is exposed from its involvement with structured entities. Transition Guidance for IFRS 10, 11 and 12 Subsequent to issuing the new standards the IASB made some changes to the transitional provisions in IFRS 10, 11 and 12. The guidance confirms that the entity is not required to apply IFRS 10 retrospectively in certain circumstances and clarifies the requirements to present adjusted comparatives. The guidance also makes changes to IFRS 11 and 12 which provide similar relief from the presentation or adjustment of comparative information for periods prior to the immediately preceding period. Further, it provides additional relief by removing the requirement to present comparatives for the disclosures relating to unconsolidated structured entities for any period before the first annual period for which IFRS 12 is applied. The new guidance is also effective for annual periods on or after January 1, 2013. Consequential amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27) and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (IAS 28) IAS 27 now only addresses separate financial statements. IAS 28 brings investments in joint ventures into its scope. However, IAS 28's equity accounting methodology remains unchanged. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (IFRS 13) IFRS 13 clarifies the definition of fair value and provides related guidance and enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not affect which items are required to be fair-valued. IFRS 13 applies prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Management is in the process of reviewing its valuation methodologies for conformity with the new requirements and has not yet completed its assessment of their impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IAS 32) The Amendments to IAS 32 add application guidance to address inconsistencies in applying IAS 32’s criteria for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities in the following two areas: the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off” that some gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement. 75 The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and are required to be applied retrospectively. Management does not anticipate a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements from these Amendments. Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IFRS 7) Qualitative and quantitative disclosures have been added to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7) relating to gross and net amounts of recognised financial instruments that are (a) set off in the statement of financial position and (b) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements, even if not set off in the statement of financial position. The Amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. The required disclosures should be provided retrospectively. Management does not anticipate a material impact on the consolidated financial statements from these Amendments. IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine This new interpretation addresses accounting issues regarding waste removal costs incurred in surface mining activities during the production phase of a mine, referred to as production stripping costs. The new interpretation addresses the classification and measurement of production stripping costs as either inventory or as a tangible or intangible non-current asset. This interpretation also provides guidance for the initial measurement, depreciation or amortization and impairment of such assets. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Management has not yet assessed the impact of the adoption of this new interpretation on its consolidated financial statements. Annual Improvements 2009-2011 The Annual Improvements 2009-2011 made several minor amendments to a number of IFRSs. The amendments relevant to the Corporation are summarised below: Clarification of the requirements for opening statement of financial position clarifies that the appropriate date for the opening statement of financial position is the beginning of the period 2010 (related notes are no longer required to be presented); addresses comparative requirements for the opening statement of financial position when an entity changes accounting policies or makes retrospective restatements or reclassifications, in accordance with IAS 8. Tax effect of distribution to holders of equity instruments addresses a perceived inconsistency between IAS 12 Income Taxes (IAS 12) and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (IAS 32) with regards to recognizing the consequences of income tax relating to distributions to holders of an equity instrument and to transaction costs of an equity transaction; clarifies that the intention of IAS 32 is to follow the requirements in IAS 12 for accounting for income tax relating to distributions to holders of an equity instrument and to transaction costs of an equity transaction. Segment information for total assets and liabilities clarifies that the total assets and liabilities for a particular reportable segment are required to be disclosed if, and only if: (i) a measure of total assets or of total liabilities (or both) is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker; (ii) there has been a material change from those measures disclosed in the last annual financial statements for that reportable segment. 76 The Annual Improvements noted above are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Management does not anticipate a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements from these Amendments. Revenue Total annual precious metal revenues decreased 14% in 2012 to $101.1 million from $118.2 million in 2011, reflecting a 20% decrease in the number of gold ounces sold from the Island Gold and Beaufor Mines, the effects of which were partially mitigated by a 7% increase in the average gold sales price realized in Canadian dollars. For the year, 60,741 ounces of gold were sold at an average price of US$1,666 (CAN$1,665) per ounce, versus gold sales of 76,143 ounces of gold in 2011 at an average price of US$1,570 (CAN$1,553) per ounce. The Island Gold Mine sold 41,686 ounces of gold in 2012 at an average price of US$1,666 (CAN$1,665), compared with 49,196 ounces of gold sold at an average price of US$1,566 (CAN$1,549) in 2011 and 45,865 ounces of gold sold at an average price of US$1,238 (CAN$1,275) in 2010. The Beaufor Mine sold 19,055 ounces of gold at an average price of US$1,666 (CAN$1,665) per ounce in 2012, compared to 26,947 ounces of gold at an average price of US$1,576 (CAN$1,559) in 2011, and 22,258 ounces at an average price of US$1,253 (CAN$1,290) per ounce in 2010. Total annual precious metal revenues of $118.2 million in 2011 was 36% above the $87.2 million generated in 2010, driven by a 21% increase in the average gold sales price realized in Canadian dollars and a 12% increase in the number of ounces of gold sold. In 2012, the Corporation had other revenues of $0.6 million from silver sales and the custom milling of 7,314 tonnes of ore at the Camflo Mill in January. Other revenues of $0.3 million in 2011 was derived entirely from silver sales, while other revenues of $3.3 million in 2010 reflected that 82,939 tonnes of custom milling ore were processed at the Camflo Mill during the year. Expenses Cost of sales, including operating costs, royalties and depreciation and depletion expenses, totalled $73.8 million in 2012, up 3% from $71.7 million in 2011, with the increase primarily driven by a 16% rise in the level of tonnage processed from the Beaufor Mine during the year. On a segmented basis, 2012 cost of sales decreased 2% year-over-year at the Island Gold Mine to $44.4 million, reflecting lower tonnage, and lower royalties and depreciation and depletion expense as a result of the 15% decrease in gold ounces sold. Operating costs at the Beaufor Mine increased 8% in 2012 to $28.7 million from $26.5 million in 2011, primarily a reflection of higher tonnage, while other operating costs rose to $0.8 million from $0.1 million in 2011 due to the higher tonnage processed at the Camflo Mill throughout the year. The average cash cost of production increased 29% in Canadian dollars in 2012 to US$1,044 (CAN$1,044) from US$821 (CAN$812) in 2011. The increase reflects higher costs at both the Island Gold Mine and Beaufor Mine operations, which were driven by slightly lower recovered grades and tonnage at Island Gold, and a significant reduction of grades at Beaufor. Cost of sales in 2011 increased 8% over the 2010 levels of $66.1 million, reflecting a slightly higher level of tonnage processed from the Island Gold Mine, higher mining costs at the Beaufor Mine due to the greater amount of development necessary to access the ore zones, as well as higher milling costs associated with operating the Camflo Mill at less than 30% capacity during the year. On a segmented basis, 2011 cost of sales rose 6% year-over-year at the Island Gold Mine to $45.1 million, reflecting higher royalties and a higher depreciation and depletion expense as a result of a higher rate and a 7% annual increase in gold ounces sold, while operating costs at the Beaufor Mine increased 24% in 2011 to $26.5 million from $21.4 million in 2010, primarily a reflection of a higher cost per tonne as well as higher depreciation and depletion expense that stemmed from a higher rate and an increase in the number of gold ounces sold. In 2011, the average cash cost of production decreased 3% or $22 in Canadian dollars to US$821 (CAN$812) from US$810 (CAN$834) in 2010. This decrease was driven by lower cash costs at Island Gold, the effect of which more than mitigated the increase in cash costs at Beaufor during the year. 77 The amount of royalties paid out in 2012 decreased to $2.3 million from $2.6 million in 2011, with the decrease reflecting lower consolidated production levels, partially offset by the higher average gold price. The Corporation pays a 3% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on the greater part of the gold production at the Island Gold Mine, and royalties of $30 per ounce on 50% of the ounces produced from the Beaufor Mine. 2011 royalty payments of $2.6 million were above the $2.1 million paid in 2010, with the increase primarily attributable to higher consolidated production levels and the higher average gold price. Custom milling - Richmont processed 7,314 tonnes of custom milling ore in 2012. Richmont did not process any custom milling ore at the Camflo Mill in 2011, versus 82,939 tonnes of custom milling ore being processed in 2010. Administration - Administration expenses totaled $10.3 million in 2012 versus $5.5 million in 2011. The higher overall cost was related to higher non-cash expenses for share-based compensation as 1,736,575 options were granted to directors, employees and officers, the payment of a $2.0 million severance compensation to the Corporation’s ex-President and CEO in the first half of 2012, to higher Board compensation, and higher salary costs stemming from the greater number of administrative employees. Administrative expenses in 2011 were 11% higher than in 2010, primarily reflecting additional staff, higher compensation and increased benefits related to exercised stock options. Exploration and project evaluation – As in previous years, Richmont Mines continued its investments related to exploration and project evaluation. Exploration Costs (in thousands of $) 2012 2011 2010 $ $ $ Exploration costs - Mines Island Gold 10,969 5,549 4,561 Beaufor 1,432 803 2,250 12,401 6,352 6,811 Exploration costs - Other properties Wasamac 9,477 6,647 1,712 Monique 744 2,284 289 W Zone - 188 334 Other 459 184 997 Project evaluation 511 470 443 Exploration and project evaluation before depreciation and exploration tax credits 23,592 16,125 10,586 Depreciation 200 155 139 Exploration tax credits (3,527 ) (5,354 ) (3,465 ) 20,265 10,926 7,260 Accretion expense of asset retirement obligations – The Corporation’s production and exploration activities are subject to various federal and provincial laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Corporation conducts its operations so as to protect public health and the environment. The Corporation has 78 recorded the asset retirement obligations of its mining sites on the basis of management’s best estimates of future costs, based on information available on the reporting date. Best estimates of future costs are the amount the Corporation would reasonably pay to settle its obligation on the closing date. Future costs are discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Such estimates are subject to change based on modifications to laws and regulations or as new information becomes available. This charge was $66 thousand in 2012, compared with $127 thousand in 2011 and $117 thousand in 2010. Loss (Gain) on disposal of long term assets – The loss (gain) on disposal of long term assets includes the following items: 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands of $) $ $ $ Valentine Lake property a) - (3,000 ) - Corporate building b) - - (496 ) Mining equipment 198 (10 ) 7 198 (3,010 ) (489 ) a) On January 24, 2011, the Corporation received $3 million from Mountain Lake Resources Inc. for the sale of its 70% interest in the Valentine Lake property located in Central Newfoundland. A gain on the disposal of long-term assets was recognized for the same amount. b) On January 4, 2010, the Corporation sold a corporate building with a net book value of $34 thousand for a cash consideration of $530 thousand. Mining and Income Taxes 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands of $) $ $ $ Current taxes 4,610 5,020 2,175 Future taxes (4,237 ) 3,523 1,568 373 8,543 3,743 The 2012 current tax expense totalled $4.6 million and includes Ontario mining taxes of $1.5 million, an adjustment to previous year taxes of $1.4 million and a recorded tax charge of $1.8 million, the latter of which enabled the Corporation to benefit from an exploration credit of the same amount. The recovery of future taxes is due to a $2.3 million reduction in liabilities for future mining taxes and a reduction of $1.9 million for income taxes. For the fiscal year 2011, mining and income taxes totalled $8.5 million or 25% of pre-tax earnings of $34.5 million. During the year, the Corporation recognized future income tax assets of $1.1 million, which reduced the income tax expense by the same amount. Excluding this income tax asset of $1.1 million, the tax rate would be 28%, the effective tax rate for the Corporation. 2010 mining and income tax expense totalled $3.7 million or 29% of pre-tax income of $12.9 million, and reflected federal and provincial taxes and future mining and income taxes applicable for the year. A $0.5 million 79 credit on mining duties from the previous year and a charge of $0.2 million relating to part XII.6 of the tax return of a subsidiary are included in this expense. Net loss from discontinued operation At the end of November 2012, management made the decision to cease commercial gold production at the Francoeur Mine. This Mine is included in the Quebec segment. As a result, revenues, expenses and losses relating to the discontinuation of this operation have been segregated from the Corporation’s results from continuing operations, and are shown as a single line item in the consolidated income statement. The Francoeur Mine remaining property, plant and equipment have been valued at their recoverable amount, and management expects that the majority of these assets will be redeployed to the Corporation’s other mines. The recoverable value of assets was established by three internal experts with the necessary expertise to determine the value of mining assets. They evaluated the fair value for each asset considering the general condition of the asset as well as the actual conditions of the market.Total charges related to the mine closure including asset write-down, closure costs and operational losses, totaled $13.9 million in the fourth quarter and $42.0 million for the full year of 2012, after mining and income taxes. Net Earnings 2011 net earnings of $25.9 million, or $0.81 per share, were well above net earnings of $9.3 million, or $0.33 per share, in 2010. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a 21% increase in the selling price per ounce in Canadian dollars and a 12% increase in ounces of gold sold in 2011. The effect of these improvements were partially offset by higher exploration and project evaluation costs stemming from the Corporation’s extensive exploration drilling program in 2011, and higher cost of sales due to higher tonnage at the Island Gold Mine, higher operating costs at the Beaufor Mine and higher milling costs associated with operating the Camflo Mill at less than 30% capacity. Balance Sheet Assets The total assets of Richmont Mines increased from $115.3 million as at December 31, 2010 to $168.0 million at the end of 2011 and decreased to 148.2 million at the end of 2012. At December 31, 2012, Richmont had working capital of $54.3 million compared with $68.7 million at December 31, 2011. The $14.4 million decrease reflects a $3.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, a $9.7 million decrease in exploration tax credits receivable, a portion of which were applied against income and mining tax liabilities, and a $5.4 million increase in account payables and accrued charges that stemmed from the discontinuation of operations at the Francoeur Mine. At December 31, 2011, Richmont had working capital of $68.7 million compared with $43.9 million at December 31, 2010. The $24.8 million increase reflected a $23.5 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, an $8.9 million increase in credit and taxes receivable, offset by a $2.7 million increase in account payables and accrued charges and an increase of $5.8 million in mining and income taxes payable. Liabilities The amount of liabilities of Richmont was $29.9 million as at December 31, 2012 and is composed of current liabilities, asset retirement obligations, finance leases obligations, long-term share based compensation and deferred income and mining tax liabilities.The amount of liabilities of the Corporation was $33.9 million as at December 31, 2011, compared with $20.5 million at December 31, 2010. 80 Asset retirement obligations The rate used to determine the future value of the obligations is 3.5% (4% in 2011) while the rate reflecting the current market assessments (adjusted for the risks specific to this liability) used to determine the actual value of the obligations is 1.3% (1% in 2011). The payments schedule was determined by taking into account the proven and probable reserves and the estimated annual production level. The following table sets forth the estimated cash flows of future retirement costs used in the calculation of the asset retirement obligations for the year ended December 31, 2012: 2012 Total amount Anticipated of the estimated cash flow cash flow payment schedule (in thousands of $) $ Beaufor Mine 785 2016 Island Gold Mine 1,467 2016 Camflo Mill 3,958 2017 Francoeur Mine 820 2013 and after 7,030 Long-Term Debt During the year, the Corporation acquired rolling stock at a cost of $1.6 million via two finance leases. The Corporation benefits from an option of a lower purchase price at the end of these two contracts. The first finance lease obligation is for an underground loader and has a carrying value of $456 thousand. The second finance lease obligation is for a boomer and has a carrying value of $539 thousand. Future minimum finance lease payments at December 31, 2012 are as follows: Minimum lease payments due (in thousands of $) 2013 2014 Total December 31, 2012: Lease payments 965 64 1,029 Finance charges (33 ) (1 ) (34 ) Net present values 932 63 995 In March and in August 2012, the Corporation signed agreements with thirteen employees considered as key personnel. These agreements incorporate a retention payment (“Retention Awards”) provided certain conditions are met by the employee, most notably that the employee continues his or her employment with the Corporation until March and August 2017. These retention payments would be payable in 2017 in either of the Corporation’s common shares or cash, at the discretion of the employee, with the number of common shares to be determined by the current value of the common shares at the time of payment. The total amount that could be paid as Retention Awards under these agreements is $6 million. The cost and liability recorded in 2012 to this effect are $639 thousand, which correspond to the best estimate of the expense and liability accrued in 2012 relating to the Retention Awards, based on estimated forfeitures and a 1.3% discount rate. 81 Long-term debt includes the following financial liabilities: December 31, December 31, 2012 2011 (in thousands of $) $ $ Finance leases obligations 995 - Long-term share-based compensation 639 - 1,634 - Current portion 932 - 702 - Deferred income and mining tax assets and liabilities Note 11 of the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report provides detailed information about tax reconciliation as well as deferred income and mining tax assets and liabilities. Shareholders’ equity Shareholders’ equity totaled $118.4 million as at December 31, 2012 compared with $134.1 million as at December 31, 2011 and with $94.8 million in 2010. At December 31, 2012, Richmont Mines had 39,566,103 shares outstanding and 2,277,450 options granted under its stock option plans and 324,675 options outside of the Corporation’s plans. At December 31, 2011, Richmont Mines had 33,109,963 shares outstanding and 1,636,600 options granted under its stock option plan compared with 31,230,063 shares outstanding and 2,311,000 options at December 31, 2010. Commitments and contingencies The Corporation is subject to royalty payments on 50% of the production of the Beaufor Mine at a rate of $30 per ounce produced, a 3% Net Smelter Return royalty per ounce produced at the Island Gold Mine. Royalty payments could be payable on other properties if such other properties are brought into commercial production. The Corporation is committed, under an operating lease expiring in December 2017, to pay a total sum of $0.7 million for office space. Minimum rental payments for the next five years amount to $0.1 million annually. The Corporation is committed, under two finance lease obligations related to rolling stock, that expire in December 2013 and in January 2014, to pay a sum totalling $1.0 million in 2013. The carrying value of rolling stock under finance leases totals $1.7 million. In March and in August 2012, the Corporation signed agreements with thirteen employees considered as key personnel. These agreements incorporate a retention payment (“Retention Awards”) provided certain conditions are met by the employee, most notably that the employee continues his or her employment with the Corporation until March and August 2017. These retention payments would be payable in 2017 in either of the Corporation’s common shares or cash, at the discretion of the employee, with the number of common shares to be determined by the current value of the common shares at the time of payment. The total amount that could be paid as Retention Awards under these agreements is $6.0 million. 82 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and the formulation of assumptions that have a significant impact on revenue and expenses as well as on the amounts of assets and liabilities. The following factors represent the estimates that management considers the most significant, and for which the actual amounts may differ considerably thereby affecting operating results. Mineral reserves The main parameters used to determine the mineral reserves of Beaufor Mine, W Zone Project and Island Gold Mine are the following: 2012 2011 2010 Gold (US$/ounce) 1,450 1,200 1,000 Exchange rate (US$/CAN$) 1.00 1.00 1.00 Gold (CAN$/ounce) 1,450 1,200 1,000 Period of depletion of mining sites in production Property, plant and equipment of mining sites in production are depleted according to the units-of-production method to write down the cost to residual value. Management estimates the residual value of property, plant and equipment based on the estimated fair value as of the financial position date. For these assets, the depletion rate is calculated based on the number of ounces of gold sold in proportion to the number of ounces in proven and probable reserves. Proven and probable reserves are estimates of the quantity of ore that could be economically and legally extracted from a mine. The Corporation estimates its reserves using information compiled by qualified persons who work for the Corporation. This information relates to geological data on the size, depth and shape of the deposit and requires geological assessments to interpret the data. The assessment of proven and probable reserves is based on factors such as the estimated exchange rate, price of metals, capital investments required and production costs stemming from geological assumptions based on the size and grade of the deposit. Changes in proven and probable reserves could have an impact on the net carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, asset retirement obligations, recognition of deferred tax assets and amortization, depreciation and depletion expenses. Asset retirement obligations The Corporation assesses its asset retirement obligations annually. Determining these obligations requires significant estimates and assumptions due to the numerous factors that affect the amount ultimately payable. Such factors include estimates of the scope and cost of restoration activities, legislative amendments, known environmental impacts, the effectiveness of reparation and restoration measures and changes in the discount rate. This uncertainty may lead to differences between the actual expense and the allowance. At the date of the statement of financial situation, asset retirement obligations represent management’s best estimate of the charge that will result when the actual obligation is terminated. Impairment test of property, plant and equipment Determining if there are any facts and circumstances indicating impairment loss or reversal of impairment losses is a subjective process involving judgment and a number of estimates and interpretations in many cases. When an indication of impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss exists, the recoverable amount of the individual asset must be estimated. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs must be determined. 83 The assumption used in the asset valuation process was a price of CAN$1,550 per ounce of gold in 2013, CAN$1,500 in 2014, and CAN$1,450 in 2015. These prices are used in order to estimate future revenues and are based on an average price obtained from mining industry analysts. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating results, such as future metal production (Proven and Probable reserves), estimated future metal prices, operating costs, capital and site restoration expenses and estimated future foreign exchange rates. These assumptions relate to future events and circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimated results. Income taxes and deferred mining taxes The Corporation is subject to taxes from different tax jurisdictions. Management continually evaluates the likelihood that its deferred tax assets could be realized. This requires management to assess whether it is probable that sufficient taxable income will exist in the future to utilize these losses within the carry-forward period. The Corporation also maintains allowances for uncertain tax positions that, in Management’s opinion, appropriately reflect the risks related to the tax positions subject to discussions, audits, differences of opinion and appeals with the tax authorities or that are otherwise uncertain. These allowances are determined using best estimates of the amount payable based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant information. These allowances are reassessed at the end of each financial reporting period to determine if the amount is sufficient. However, audits by the tax authorities could subsequently result in an additional liability. Upon the definite resolution of a tax issue resulting in a tax amount that differs from the initially recognized tax expense, the difference is recognized in the tax expense of the period of definitive settlement. Share-based remuneration expense The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen. The Corporation has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable life of options and the time of exercise of those options. The model used by the Corporation is the Black-Scholes model. The Corporation similarly evaluated the expected extinguishments for each remuneration program within the parameters of each individual program. Provisions and contingent liabilities Judgments are made as to whether a past event has led to a liability that should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements or disclosed as a contingent liability. Quantifying any such liability often involves judgments and estimations. These judgments are based on a number of factors including the nature of the claims or dispute, the legal process and potential amount payable, legal advice received, past experience and the probability of a loss being realized. Several of these factors are sources of estimation uncertainty. Start of advanced exploration phase The Corporation evaluates the potential of each project to determine when the project should progress from the exploration phase to the advanced exploration phase. Once Management has determined that a project has demonstrated a potential for development, and a feasibility study supports its commercial viability and its economic benefit, the project moves into the advanced exploration phase once approval has been given by the Board of Directors. Expenditures related to the project are capitalized as of this time. Start of commercial production Management assesses the stage of completion of each advanced exploration project to determine when it begins commercial production. The Corporation considers a number of criteria to determine when a mine enters into commercial production, thereby resulting in reclassification from “Advanced exploration project” to “Mining site in production”. The following criteria are used: 84 Production capacity achieved; Recovered grade; Stage of completion of development work. When a mine under advanced exploration project becomes a mining site under production, previously capitalized costs are allocated among the various assets, such as inventory, development expenses, buildings and equipment. Additionally, from that time, some previously capitalized costs are then recognized as expenses and the related income is recognized as precious metals revenue. Depreciation/depletion begins at that time as well.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (all dollar amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated) At December 31, 2012, Richmont had a working capital of $54.3 million compared with $68.7 million at December 31, 2011 and $43.9 million at December 31, 2010. The $14.4 million decrease reflects a $3.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, a $9.7 million decrease in exploration tax credits receivable, a portion of which were applied against income and mining tax liabilities, and a $5.4 million increase in account payables and accrued charges that stemmed from the discontinuation of operations at the Francoeur Mine. The $24.8 million increase from 2010 to 2011 reflected a $23.5 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, an $8.9 million increase in credit and taxes receivable, offset by a $2.7 million increase in account payables and accrued charges and an increase of $5.8 million in mining and income taxes payable. Certain of the restricted deposits relate specifically to site restoration. As at December 31, 2012, the Corporation had $161 thousand in deposits restricted with the Quebec government, $184 thousand in deposits restricted with the Ontario government and a credit facility is available to the Corporation in the amount of $3.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit as guarantees for the settlement of asset retirement obligations. The credit facility has a fixed annual fee of 0.85% (0.85% in 2011). The following table provides the allocation of deposits restricted and letters of credit issued as at December 31, 2012: 85 2012 Date of (in thousands of $) $ renewal Deposits restricted Island Gold Mine (Lochalsh property) 184 Beaufor Mine 107 Francoeur Mine 54 345 Others 339 684 Letters of credit Camflo Mill 1,332 January 20, 2013 Island Gold Mine (Kremzar property) 979 January 26, 2013 2,311 Cash flow from operating activities Cash flow from operations decreased from $38.8 million in 2011 to $7.7 million in 2012. This decrease reflects that net earnings in 2011 were $25.9 million, or $0.81 per share, compared with net loss of $45.0 million or ($1.28) per share in 2012 reflecting a 20% decrease in ounces of gold sales mitigated by a 7% increase in the selling price in Canadian dollars. Futhermore Richmont spent $20.3 million in exploration costs in 2012 compared to $10.9 million in 2011. Cash flow from operations increased from $18.3 million in 2010 to an amount of $38.8 million in 2011 as mentioned above. This increase reflects a 21% increase in the selling price per ounce in Canadian dollars, and a 12% increase in ounces of gold sold. Somewhat mitigating the effect of the improvements were higher exploration and project evaluation costs and higher cost of sales. Cash flow used in investing activities Richmont invested $37.9 million in the ongoing development of its assets in 2012, up from $31.7 million in 2011. The notable year-over-year increase reflects the advancement of the underground exploration drift at the Island Gold Mine to improve access for deep exploration drilling below the mine’s current infrastructure. The level of increased investment similarly reflects the development of the ramp to access the W Zone, a near-surface zone located on the Beaufor Mine property. An additional $2.9 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2012, up from $0.9 million in 2011. The 2011 investment level of $31.7 million represented a notable increase over the $16.8 million investment level of 2010. This variance primarily reflects that a total of 18,910 metres of development and definition drilling were completed during 2011 at the Francoeur Mine, versus a total of 2,902 metres during 2010. Capital expenditures at the Island Gold Mine in 2011 included ongoing development costs, and the refurbishment and acquisition of equipment. Capital expenditures at the Beaufor Mine in 2011 included the construction of a new emergency escape exit from level 12 of the mine to surface, while expenditures of $3.5 million at the W Zone reflected advanced exploration activities and the start of work on the ramp portal. An additional $0.9 million was invested at the Camflo Mill and other corporate installations in 2011, versus $0.5 million in 2010. 86 (in thousands of $) 2012 $ 2011 $ 2010 $ Island Gold Mine 8,364 4,959 4,650 W Zone - Beaufor Property 9,911 3,480 - Beaufor Mine 1,192 3,090 2,462 Discontinued operation - Francoeur Mine 15,458 19,237 9,144 Other 2,929 904 518 37,854 31,670 16,774 Cash flow from financing activities The Corporation issued 483,600 common shares during 2012 and 899,400 in 2011 following the exercise of stock options, for a total cash consideration of $1.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively. In 2010, the Corporation issued 401,000 common shares following the exercise of stock options, for a total cash consideration of $1.5 million. In September 2012, the Corporation issued, as part of a private placement, 5,972,540 common shares at $4.35 each for a total consideration of $26.0 million. An expense of $1.0 million has been incurred relating to the issuance of common shares, creating a non recorded future tax asset of $0.2 million. On October 2011, the Corporation issued, as part of a private placement, 980,500 common shares at $10.50 each, for a total cash consideration of $10.3 million and 245,125 stock warrants. An amount of $0.5 million was incurred in relation to the issuance of common shares, creating a future tax asset of $0.1 million. In May 2010, the Corporation filed a $25 million short form base shelf prospectus that covers a 25-month period. Consequently, Richmont Mines may elect to offer and issue common shares of the Corporation, warrants, subscription receipts, or any combination of such securities up to an aggregate initial offering price of $25 million over this timeframe. On June 2010, the Corporation completed an equity financing of 3,300,000 common shares at a price of $5.00 per common share, for gross proceeds of $16.5 million. The net proceeds of the offering has been used for development work at Richmont’s projects, primarily the Francoeur Mine in Quebec, for potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Also, on June 2010, the Corporation issued 1,425,407 common shares at a price of $4.69 each, following Richmont’s successful acquisition of the outstanding 30% of the issued and outstanding shares of Louvem Mines Inc. that it did not previously own. Capital disclosures Richmont’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $59.8 million at December 31, 2012, $63.5 million at December 31, 2011 and $40.0 million at December 31, 2010. The Corporation invests its cash and cash equivalents in high-quality securities issued by government agencies, financial institutions and major corporations, and limits its amount of credit exposure by diversifying its holdings. The Corporation’s objectives when managing its capital are to safeguard the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to support ongoing exploration programs and the development of its mining assets, to provide sufficient working capital to meet its ongoing obligations and to pursue potential investments. The Corporation’s working capital is sufficient for its present requirements. The Corporation’s profitability may vary significantly as a result of many factors, including, the price of gold, Canadian dollar/United States dollar 87 exchange rate, fluctuations in commodity prices and unforeseen variations from expected grade, tonnage levels and production costs at its operating mines. The Corporation has no material commitments for either capital expenditures or its exploration program. The Corporation’s budget can be modified and its investments adjusted depending on available funds and operating and exploration results. The exploration and development of new mineral deposits is subject to numerous risks, discussed in greater detail on page 8. As at December 31, 2012, Richmont Mines had no hedging contracts. In order to finance additional exploration activities or to maintain or increase its liquidity and capital resources, the Corporation may decide to issue new shares or to issue new debt. C.

These retention payments would be payable in 2017 either through the issuance of the Corporation’s common shares or cash, at the discretion of the employee, with the number of common shares to be determined by the market value of the common shares at the time of payment. 91 Summary Compensation Table of the Named Executive Officers Share- Option- Name and Fiscal based based Non-equity incentive plan All other Total principal position year Salary awards awards compensation compensation compensation ($) ($) ($) (1) ($) ($) (2) ($) Annual Long term incentive incentive plans plans (Bonus) Paul Carmel(3) 2012 182,000 1,000,000 184,000 18,250 1,384,250 President and 2011 - n/a - - n/a - - Chief Executive 2010 - - - - - Officer Pierre Rougeau(4) 2012 20,000 183,490 - 460 203,950 Executive Vice- 2011 - n/a - - n/a - - President and 2010 - - - - - Chief Financial Officer Christian 2012 280,000 53,000 120,000 25,500 478,500 Pichette(5) 2011 265,000 n/a 70,000 100,000 n/a 20,185 455,185 Executive Vice- 2010 255,000 80,000 55,000 18,960 408,960 President and Chief Operating Officer Nicole Veilleux 2012 165,000 25,000 36,000 16,840 242,840 Financial Director 2011 160,000 n/a 20,500 50,450 n/a 14,790 245,740 2010 135,000 38,600 30,000 13,430 217,030 Martin Rivard(6) 2012 208,300 - - 2,001,617 2,209,917 President and 2011 310,000 n/a 150,000 115,170 n/a 25,142 600,312 Chief Executive 2010 300,000 118,000 120,000 14,365 552,365 Officer Notes: 1) The Corporation granted 15,800 options to Nicole Veilleux and 33,400 options to Christian Pichette on December 12, 2012, 100,000 options to Pierre Rougeau on November 23, 2012 and 324,675 options to Paul Carmel on May, 22, 2012. The fair value of the options granted annually is determined by multiplying the number of options granted by their value under the Black & Scholes model or is based on the value of the services rendered, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

During this meeting, it was decided that the members of the Board (with the exception of the Executive Chairman of the Board) would be paid a sum of $20,000 in annual compensation for the 2012 year, that an additional sum of $12,000 would be paid to each Chair of a sub-committee of the Board of Directors, and that meeting attendance fees would no longer be given to Board members. The level of the annual compensation of the members of the Board of Directors (with the exception of the Executive Chairman of the Board) is based on the Human Resources and Compensation Committee’s analysis regarding compensation levels of directors of mining companies that are similar to Richmont. Executive Chairman of the Board compensation On May 12, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized an annual compensation of $270,000 for 2012. The Executive Chairman was not eligible to receive an annual bonus. On an aggregate basis, the Corporation’s Board members therefore received total compensation of $3,429,574 during the 2012 fiscal year, as detailed in the table below. Please note that this table does not include the compensation granted to the Chief Executive Officer, who is also a director of the Board.

Board Practices The directors serve as directors of the Corporation from their election until the next Annual and Special General Meeting that will be held on May 9, 2013 or until a successor is duly elected. Directors Name Elected or Appointed Director Réjean Houle January 1989 H. Greg Chamandy May 2009 Elaine Ellingham February 2010 Samuel Minzberg February 2010 Michael Pesner November 2010 Eberhard Scherkus April 2012 Paul Carmel May 2012 Employment Contracts The Corporation has entered into employment contracts with the Named Executive Officers: Paul Carmel, as President and Chief Executive Officer; Pierre Rougeau, as Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer; Christian Pichette, as Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer, and Nicole Veilleux, as Financial Director. The contracts of Christian Pichette and Nicole Veilleux provide that, in the event of termination initiated by the Corporation without cause or initiated by a Named Executive Officer for good reason, or if the contract is not renewed, the Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Pichette, will be entitled to receive an amount equal to one year of total compensation (total compensation is defined as all the components which have monetary value and, without limiting the scope of the foregoing, any salary, bonuses, RRSP contributions and automobile allowances, if any) and the continuation of other benefits over this same period, while the Financial Director, Mrs. Veilleux, for her part will be entitled to one month of total compensation by year of service, notwithstanding such year of service is completed or not. For the purposes of calculating the severance payment, the Named Executive Officer’s total compensation will be based on the annual average of the two (2) complete fiscal years immediately preceding the date of termination. Moreover, and notwithstanding the provisions contained in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan and the conditions of the options held by the Named Executive Officers, all the options held by each of the Named Executive Officers will become vested on the termination date. Also, the options thus vested on the termination date will be exercisable on the earliest of the following two dates: (i) on the dates initially stipulated; or (ii) two years after the termination date. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that the termination occurred on the last working day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation and that this date falls during the renewal term of the contract of employment of the Named Executive Officer is $475,790 for the Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer and $305,441 for the Financial Director. These amounts include the options annual average value attributed during the last two years. The contracts of Paul Carmel and Pierre Rougeau provide that, if the termination occurs at any time, by the Corporation, without cause, Mr. Carmel and Mr. Rougeau will be entitled to the basic payments (accrued base salary, accrued expenses and vacation), to an indemnity in lieu of notice representing two (2) times the base salary at the time of the termination of the agreement (one (1) time in the case of Mr. Rougeau), the entitlement under the annual bonus plan, the whole minus applicable deductions and the same level of group insurance benefits he was receiving or entitled to receive for two (2) years (one (1) year in the case of Mr. Rougeau) 95 following the date of termination. All un-vested options held by the executive on the date of termination will automatically vest on this day. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that the termination occurred on the last working day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation is $904,488 for the President and CEO and $363,432 for the Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. Change of Control Agreements The Corporation has also entered into an agreement with the Executive Chairman of the Board and with each of the Named Executive Officers in case of a change of control. For the Named Executive Officers: In the event that, during a three-year period after the date of a “change of control”, the employment contract of Nicole Veilleux or Christian Pichette were to be terminated by his or her resignation for valid cause or by the severing by the Corporation of the employment relationship binding him or her to the Corporation for cause other than serious cause or his permanent incapacity, then the Corporation shall pay him or her, in addition to the payment of any amount owed to him or her as unpaid salary and vacation accumulated but not yet taken on the termination date, within 30 days of the termination date, a lump sum equivalent to twice his or her total average annual compensation (total compensation is defined as all the components which have monetary value and, without limiting the scope of the foregoing, any salary, bonuses (applicable for the period, regardless of whether they are calculated at that time), benefits, automobile allowances if any and insurance), based on the average annual amount of total compensation for the two full calendar years preceding the termination date, minus applicable deductions. Also, all the options held by the Named Executive Officer will become vested on the termination date and thereupon may be exercised. Moreover, and notwithstanding the provisions contained in the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan and the conditions of the options held by the Named Executive Officers, the maturity dates of the options thus exercisable will be those initially stipulated, but without exceeding three years after the termination date. The change of control agreements will end upon the termination of the Named Executive Officer within the Corporation if it occurs before the occurrence of a change of control. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that a change of control occurred on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation, is $951,579 for the Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer and $488,706 for the Financial Director. These amounts include the options annual average value attributed during the last two years. In the event that following termination of employment, amounts are payable to a Named Executive Officer pursuant to an employment contract and a change of control agreement, the Corporation would only have to pay the greater of the two amounts for the Executive Vice–President and Chief Financial Officer and for the Financial Director. The contracts of Paul Carmel and Pierre Rougeau provide that, after a change of control, if the contract is terminated within six (6) months following the change in control, Mr. Carmel and Mr. Rougeau will be entitled to the basic payments (accrued base salary, accrued expenses and vacation), to an indemnity in lieu of notice representing three (3) times the base salary at the time of the termination of the agreement (two (2) times in the case of Mr. Rougeau), the entitlement under the annual bonus plan, the whole minus applicable deductions and the same level of group insurance benefits he was receiving or entitled to receive for three (3) years (one (1) year in Mr. Rougeau’s case) following the date of termination. All un-vested options held by the executive on the date of termination will automatically vest on this day. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that a change of control occurred on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation, is $1,206,732 for the President and Chief Executive Officer and $603,432 for the Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. 96 For the Executive Chairman of the Board (the “Executive”): (a) In case of a change of control: In the event that the Executive’s appointment as Chairman of the Board is terminated by the Corporation (including, without limitation, if the Executive does not stand for election or is not elected a director of the Corporation) or the Executive resigns from his position as Executive Chairman of the Board, either (1) at the time of, or within 12 months following, the occurrence of a transaction or event constituting a Change of Control, or (2) within 6 months prior to the occurrence of a transaction or event constituting a Change of Control, in each case (if applicable) whether or not the Executive remains non-executive Chairman of the Board or a director of the Corporation, the Executive will be entitled to the payments and benefits set out hereafter: (a) his annual base salary accrued and unpaid up to and including the date of termination; (b) any annual bonus plan payment to which the Executive may be entitled as of the date of termination; (c) a severance payment equal to one (1) time the Executive’s annual base salary; (d) his accrued expenses up to and including the date of termination. The estimated amount that could be paid by the Corporation in these given circumstances, assuming that a change of control occurred on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation, is $270,000 for the Executive Chairman of the Board. (b) In case of a termination other than under a change of control: In the event of the termination of the Executive’s appointment as Executive Chairman other than under a change of control, either by the Corporation or by the Executive’s resignation from his position as the Executive Chairman of the Board, (in each case, if applicable, whether or not the Executive remains non-executive Chairman of the Board or a director of the Corporation), the Executive will be entitled to receive the following compensation: (a) his annual base salary accrued and unpaid up to and including the date of termination; (b) any annual bonus plan payment to which the Executive may be entitled as of the date of termination; (c) his accrued expenses up to and including the date of termination. There would not be any amounts owed to the Executive Chairman of the Board following a termination on the last business day of the most recent financial year of the Corporation. In all of the cases noted above, a change of control occurs when: (i) another party acquires, directly or indirectly, alone or with any person acting in concert with him, more than 33 1/3% of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation, (ii) after a takeover bid, a public offer of exchange, a merger, an arrangement, another form of business combination, a sale of assets of the Corporation or a contested election, or any combination of these transactions, the persons who are directors of the Corporation immediately prior to these transactions cease, after these transactions, to represent the majority of the directors on the Board, or on the Board of Directors of any parent Corporation or successor of the Corporation, or (iii) the shareholders of another entity hold more than 33 1/3% of the outstanding voting securities of the entity resulting from a merger, arrangement or other form of business combination with the other entity. 97 Human Resources and Compensation Committee The Board has a Human Resources and Compensation Committee composed entirely of independent directors. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee meets at least once a year to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of Corporation’s employees, executive officers and directors. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee takes into consideration the responsibilities and workload of executive officers in formulating its recommendations and favors giving key personnel competitive compensation in order to keep them with the Corporation. Each member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee has been in a senior leadership position in various organizations, and in those capacities obtained direct experience relevant to executive compensation, and has the skills and experience that enable the Human Resources and Compensation Committee to make decisions on the suitability of the Corporation’s compensation policies and practices. In fiscal year 2012, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Corporation was composed of Mr. Sam Minzberg, Mr. Michael Pesner and Mr. Réjean Houle. The compensation of the Executive Chairman of the Board, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers is determined by the Board of Directors following recommendations by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. As the Board of Directors establishes the salaries of executive officers, it should be noted that the Executive Chairman of the Board and the President and Chief Executive Officer abstain from the discussion and the ensuing decision concerning their total compensation arrangements. Governance and Ethics Committee The Board has a Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee, which meets at least once a year and is composed of a majority of independent directors. In fiscal year 2012, the Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee was composed of Elaine Ellingham, Michael Pesner and Greg Chamandy. The Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee’s mandate is to evaluate every aspect of the Corporation’s governance practices. In particular, the Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee examines the effectiveness of the Corporation’s governance practices at regular intervals, and reviews the role and the mandate of the Board and its committees. The Board does not have a nominating committee to identify new candidates for Board nomination, however the Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee exercises all of the functions of a nominating committee. Comprised of a majority of independent directors, the Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding selection criteria for directors, and periodically reviews the criteria the Board has adopted, as the case may be. When necessary, the Board looks for candidates with varied backgrounds, who can contribute to the overall performance of the Board, and who have demonstrated integrity, independence, experience and leadership in the past. Directors and members of senior management may recommend a candidate to the Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee if he or she believes that the individual possesses the required abilities to successfully perform the duties of a director. The Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee is responsible for conducting an interview with the candidate, from which it will form recommendations that will then be given to the Board of Directors. Audit Committee The Audit Committee is a standing committee of the Board of Directors whose primary function is to carry out a detailed and thorough review of audit matters, to be responsible for the oversight of the work of any accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit or review services for the Corporation (including resolution of disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial reporting), to consider and approve related party transactions and to offer the Corporation’s auditors, shareholders and employees a direct link to the non-executive directors. This Committee will assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information which will be provided to the 98 shareholders and others, the internal auditing and disclosure controls and procedures, the audit process, and adherence to applicable laws and regulations. In carrying out its duties, the Committee will apply reasonable materiality standards to all matters under review. The Audit Committee is composed of Messrs Michael Pesner, Ebe Scherkus and Sam Minzberg. All members of the audit committee are independent and financially literate as defined in National Instrument 52-110 Audit Committees (“NI 52-110”). Mr. Pesner is a CPA, CA and is President of Hermitage Canada Finance Inc., a Corporation that specializes in financial advisory services.

Mr. Pesner also serves on the Board of Directors of the following public companies: Quest Rare Minerals Ltd., Mint Technology Corp., Bitumen Capital Inc., Le Château Inc. and Unite Capital Corp. Mr. Scherkus recently retired as President and Chief Operating Officer of Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. after a 27 year career. Mr. Scherkus is a graduate of McGill University (B.Sc.), a member of the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario and past president of the Quebec Mining Association. He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Premier Gold Mines ltd. and Stornaway Diamond Corporation. Mr. Minzberg is a senior partner with the law firm Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg, LLP in Montreal, and is a member of the firm’s Management Committee. Mr. Minzberg specializes in corporate, commercial and tax law. He was previously President and CEO of Claridge Inc., a management and holding company on behalf of the Charles R. Bronfman Family. Mr. Minzberg also serves on the Board of Directors of Quebecor Média Inc., HSBC Bank Canada and Reitmans (Canada) Ltd. Environmental, Health and Safety Committee On December 8, 2010, the Board of Directors created the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee, composed of a majority of independent directors. In fiscal year 2012, the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee was composed of Réjean Houle, Ebe Scherkus and Elaine Ellingham. The Environmental, Health and Safety Committee is responsible for evaluating whether the Corporation’s current environmental, health and safety practices are appropriate, for ensuring that these practices are standardized across all of the Corporation’s divisions, and for making recommendations when appropriate. The Chairman of the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee is responsible for providing the Board of Directors with an account of the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee. D.

Following the approval and adoption of the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan in May 2012, options are no longer granted under the Share Option Plan and all grants of awards are now made under the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”). As of December 31, 2012, options for the acquisition of a total of 1,377,550 common shares under the Share Option Plan were outstanding and with exercise prices ranging from $1.80 to $12.03 per share, representing approximately 3.5% of the common shares issued and outstanding on such date. As at December 31, 2012, options to acquire a total of 899,900 common shares had been granted under the Omnibus Plan and 324,675 options had been granted outside of the Corporation’s Omnibus Plan, representing approximately 3.1% of the common shares issued and outstanding on such date, leaving a balance of 1,079,006 available options to be issued by the Board of Directors pursuant to the Omnibus Plan, as indicated in the table below. 101 Information regarding Omnibus and Share Option plans as at December 31, 2012 Number of shares to be Weighted-average Number of shares issued upon exercise of exercise price of available for future grants outstanding options outstanding options under the Omnibus Plan Omnibus and Share Option plans 2,277,450 $5.89 1,079,006 (approved by the holders) During the year 2012, 18 option holders exercised a total of 483,600 options. The total number of common shares reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to Awards (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) (including the common shares issuable upon exercise of the options granted under the Share Option Plan of the Corporation) shall not exceed a number of common shares equal to ten percent (10%) of the total issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation at the time of granting of Awards (on a non-diluted basis) or such other number as may be approved by the TSX and the shareholders of the Corporation from time to time. Options are no longer granted under the Share Option Plan and all grants of Awards are now made under the Omnibus Plan. Any increase in the issued and outstanding common shares (whether as a result of exercise of Awards or otherwise) will result in an increase in the number of common shares that may be issued on Awards outstanding at any time and any increase in the number of Awards granted will, upon exercise, make new grants available under the Omnibus Plan. The Omnibus Plan provides that the aggregate number of common shares of the Corporation (a) issued to “Insiders” and “Associates” (as each such term is defined in the Omnibus Plan) of such Insiders under the Omnibus Plan or any other proposed or established share compensation arrangement within any one-year period and (b) issuable to Insiders and Associates of such Insider at any time under the Omnibus Plan or any other proposed or established share compensation arrangement, shall not in each case exceed ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation. Awards granted or awarded under the Omnibus Plan may not be assigned or transferred with the exception of an assignment made to a personal representative of a deceased “Participant” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan). The Board of Directors may in its sole discretion, appoint from time to time one or more entities to act as administrative agent to administer the Awards under the Omnibus Plan. The Board of Directors will not provide financial assistance to Participants to assist them in exercising their Awards, provided, however, that the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, amend the Omnibus Plan to authorize the administrator under the Omnibus Plan to make arrangements to provide a form of financial assistance to the Participants. The Omnibus Plan is managed by the Board of Directors which establishes the terms of the option grants, including the exercise price, provided however, that the exercise price is not lower than the market price, as determined by the closing asked price of the common shares on the TSX on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant. The options granted under the Omnibus Plan are vested or become subject to exercise according to the terms established by the Board of Directors at the time of grant. If the expiry date falls during a blackout period (during any period when the Corporation’s policies do not permit an option holder to exercise an option) or within ten business days following the last day of the blackout period, then the expiry date will be the last day of this ten business day period. Following the termination without cause of an option holder, the options that remain unexercised must be exercised within 60 days in the case of the termination without cause or resignation, 1 year in the case of death, 3 years in the case of disability or injury and 3 years in the case of early retirement. The Board of Directors has the discretionary power to modify these terms and periods, provided that options cannot expire later than 10 years from the date on which they were granted. 102 If at any time after the grant of an Award to any Participant and prior to the expiration of the term of such Award, the Common Shares shall be reclassified, reorganised or otherwise changed, the Corporation shall consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into another corporation (the corporation resulting or continuing from such consolidation, merger or amalgamation being herein called the “Successor Corporation”), the Participant shall be entitled to receive upon the subsequent exercise or vesting of such Award, in accordance with the terms thereof and shall accept in lieu of the number of Shares then subscribed for but for the same aggregate consideration payable therefore, the aggregate number of shares of the appropriate class or other securities of the Corporation or the Successor Corporation (as the case may be) or other consideration from the Corporation or the Successor Corporation (as the case may be) that such Participant would have been entitled to receive as a result of such reclassification, reorganization or other change of shares or, as a result of such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, if on the record date of such reclassification, reorganization or other change of shares or the effective date of such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, as the case may be, such Participant had been the registered holder of the number of Shares to which such Participant was immediately theretofore entitled upon such exercise or vesting of such Award. If, at any time after the grant of an Award to any Participant and prior to the expiration of the term of such Award, the Corporation shall make a distribution to all holders of Shares or other securities in the capital of the Corporation, or cash, evidences of indebtedness or other assets of the Corporation (excluding an ordinary course dividend in cash or shares, but including for greater certainty shares or equity interests in a subsidiary or business unit of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries or cash proceeds of the disposition of such a subsidiary or business unit), or should the Corporation effect any transaction or change having a similar effect, then the price or the number of Shares to which the Participant is entitled upon exercise or vesting of Award shall be adjusted to take into account such distribution, transaction or change. The Board shall determine the appropriate adjustments to be made in such circumstances in order to maintain the Participants' economic rights in respect of their Awards in connection with such distribution, transaction or change. The Board may amend the Omnibus Plan or any Award at any time without the consent of the Participants provided that such amendment shall: not adversely alter or impair any Award previously granted; be subject to any regulatory approvals including, where required, the approval of the TSX; and be subject to shareholder approval, where required, by law or the requirements of the TSX, provided that shareholder approval shall not be required for the following amendments and the Board may make any changes which may include but are not limited to: amendments of a "housekeeping" nature; a change to the vesting provisions of any Award; the introduction or amendment of a cashless exercise feature payable in securities, whether or not such feature provides for a full deduction of the number of underlying securities from the Omnibus Plan reserve (as defined in the Omnibus Plan); the addition of a form of financial assistance and any amendment to a financial assistance provision which is adopted; a change to the “Eligible Participants” of the Omnibus Plan (as defined in the Omnibus Plan), including a change which would have the potential of broadening or increasing participation by Insiders; and the addition of a deferred or restricted share unit or any other provision which results in Participants receiving securities while no cash consideration is received by the issuer. The Board shall be required to obtain shareholder approval to make the following amendments: any change to the maximum number of Shares issuable from treasury under the Omnibus Plan; 103 any amendment which reduces the exercise price of any Award, as applicable, after such an Award has been granted or any cancellation of an Award and the substitution of that Award by a new Award with a reduced price; any amendment which extends the expiry date of any Award, or the Restriction Period (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) of any Restricted Share Units (RSU) beyond the original expiry date, except in case of an extension due to a Black-Out Period (as defined in the Omnibus Plan); any amendment which would permit a change to the Eligible Participants, including a change which would have the potential of broadening or increasing participation by Insiders; any amendment which would permit any Award granted under the Omnibus Plan to be transferable or assignable by any Participant; any amendment which increases the maximum number of Shares that may be issued to (i) Insiders and Associates of such Insiders; or (ii) any one Insider and Associates of such Insider under the Omnibus Plan and any other proposed or established “Share Compensation Arrangement” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) in a one-year period; any amendment to the amendment provisions of the Omnibus Plan, provided that Shares held directly or indirectly by Insiders benefiting from the amendments shall be excluded when obtaining such shareholder approval. Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in the Omnibus Plan, in a “Grant Agreement” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) contemplated herein, but subject to any specific provisions contained in any “Employment Agreements” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan), in the event of a Change in Control under the Omnibus Plan, a reorganization of the Corporation, an amalgamation of the Corporation, an arrangement involving the Corporation, a take-over bid (as that term is defined in the Securities Act (Québec)) for all of the Shares or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation, the Board may make such provision for the protection of the rights of the Participants as the Board in its discretion considers appropriate in the circumstances, including, without limitation, changing the “Performance Criteria” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) and/or other vesting conditions for the Awards and/or the date on which any Award expires or the “Restriction Period” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan), the “Performance Period” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan), the Performance Criteria and/or other vesting conditions for the Awards. The Board may, by resolution, advance the date on which any Award may be exercised or payable or, subject to applicable regulatory provisions and shareholder approval, extend the expiration date of any Award, in the manner to be set forth in such resolution provided that the period during which an “Option” (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) or a Share Appreciation Rights (“SAR”) is exercisable or RSU is outstanding does not exceed ten (10) years from the date such Option or SAR is granted in the case of Options and SARs and three (3) years after the calendar year in which the award is granted in the case of RSUs. The Board shall not, in the event of any such advancement or extension, be under any obligation to advance or extend the date on or by which any Option or SAR may be exercised or RSU may be outstanding by any other Participant. The Committee may, by resolution, but subject to applicable regulatory approvals, decide that any of the provisions hereof concerning the effect of termination of the Participant's employment shall not apply for any reason acceptable to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. The Board may, subject to regulatory approval, discontinue the Omnibus Plan at any time without the consent of the Participants provided that such discontinuance shall not materially and adversely affect any Awards previously granted to a Participant under the Omnibus Plan.

ITEM 7. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS A. Major Shareholders As of April 19, 2013, to the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Corporation, Oxbridge Bank & Trust SCC (“Oxbridge”), an entity ultimately controlled by H. Greg Chamandy, a member of the Board of the Corporation and Chairman of the Board, is the only shareholder, directly or indirectly, beneficially owning or controlling over more than 5% of the outstanding common shares of the Corporation. Oxbridge, with its affiliates, beneficially owns or controls directly or indirectly 5,016,363 common shares and 457,000 common share options, representing approximately 12.67% of the outstanding common shares of the Corporation (excluding common shares underlying outstanding options). See “ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES – E. Share Ownership” above. Mr. Chamandy and Oxbridge became a shareholder of the Corporation in 2009. Mr. Chamandy or Oxbridge does not have any different voting rights compared with the Corporation’s other shareholders. As of April 19, 2013, a total of 7,413,354 shares of the Corporation’s common shares, representing 18.72% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation’s common shares, were held by a total of 124 U.S. record holders. The Corporation is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any foreign government or by any other natural or legal person, severally or jointly. The Corporation has no knowledge of any arrangement that may, at a subsequent date, result in a change of control of the Corporation. 105 B. Related Party Transactions A Related Party Transaction is any transaction between the Corporation and (a) enterprises that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, control or are controlled by, or are under common control with, the Corporation; (b) associates; (c) individuals owning, directly or indirectly, an interest in the voting power of the Corporation that gives them significant influence over the Corporation, and close members of any such individual’s family; (d) key management personnel, that is, those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Corporation, including directors and senior management and close members of such individuals’ families; and (e) enterprises in which a substantial interest in the voting power is owned, directly or indirectly, by any person described in (c) or (d) or over which such a person is able to exercise significant influence. Throughout the year 2012, and until the date of this Annual Report, certain Related Party Transactions occurred with the Corporation, as described below: Oxbridge Bank & Trust SCC On May 12, 2009, Oxbridge announced that it had acquired common shares of the Corporation and that, together with its joint actors, it owned and controlled an aggregate of approximately 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation. On November 24, 2009, Oxbridge amended its public disclosure related to the Corporation, and announced that it had acquired common shares from a private investor and that, subject to the completion of such acquisition, Oxbridge, together with its joint actors, would own and control common shares and options to purchase common shares representing an aggregate amount of approximately 19.49% of the issued and outstanding common shares (excluding common shares underlying outstanding options). Oxbridge also indicated that it intended to engage in discussions with the Board and management of the Corporation, as well as other shareholders, regarding the Corporation, its prospects and potential means for enhancing shareholder value, including potential changes in the business, strategy or Board composition of the Corporation. On November 25, 2009, in a letter duly authorized by the Board of Directors of Oxbridge and delivered to Denis Arcand, Chairman of the Board, and to the other members of the Board, Mr. Chamandy outlined certain proposals from Oxbridge (the “Oxbridge Proposals”) including the addition of Elaine Ellingham, A. Michel Lavigne, Samuel Minzberg and Jean-Pierre Ouellet (the “Proposed Directors”) to the Board, all with a view to maximizing the Corporation’s potential value for all of its shareholders. On November 30, 2009, Oxbridge announced the completion of the acquisition of common shares announced on November 24, 2009. Based on the Oxbridge Proposals and the Board’s own independent review of the Proposed Director’s qualifications, credentials, expertise, and experience, the directors determined that there existed no impediment, legally or from a corporate governance perspective, to the Proposed Directors acting as directors of the Corporation or holding their proposed positions on the Board committees, for reasons of conflict of interests or otherwise, and that the Proposed Directors, together with the current directors, have the qualifications, credentials, expertise and experience to implement the execution of the contemplated strategic plan for the Corporation’s future growth. Accordingly, on December 15, 2009, the Board unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Corporation and all its stakeholders to call a meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation for the purposes of electing the Proposed Directors. In addition, Mr. Chamandy was appointed Chairman of the Board and Mr. Arcand was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Board. Finally, the Board approved and the Corporation executed a mutual undertaking whereby (A) Mr. Chamandy and Oxbridge, in their capacity as shareholders of the Corporation, have undertaken to vote, and to cause to be 106 voted, all shares of the Corporation that they, or any person with whom they are acting jointly or in connection with the Corporation, control directly or indirectly, in favour of the election of the current directors of the Corporation, as directors of the Corporation at all meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation to be held prior to December 31, 2012, at which directors are to be elected; and (B) the Corporation has undertaken (i) to cause the Proposed Directors (or any replacement) to be included as nominees proposed by the Corporation to its shareholders for election at the meeting; (ii) to ensure that the Proposed Directors and one additional individual (the “Additional Director”) to be identified by Mr. Chamandy, duly authorized by Oxbridge, before the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation (or any replacement), be included as nominees proposed by the Corporation to its shareholders for election to the Board of Directors at all meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation at which directors are to be elected prior to December 31, 2011; and (iii) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of such Proposed Directors at such meetings in each case, provided that (x) there exists no impediment, legal or from a corporate governance perspective, to such replacement person or Additional Director, as the case may be, acting as a director of the Corporation, for reasons of conflict of interest or otherwise, and (y) such replacement person or Additional Director, as the case may be, has the qualifications, credentials, expertise and experience to oversee the execution of the Corporation’s strategic plan for future growth together with the current directors, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Davies, Ward, Phillips & Vineberg On February 4, 2010, Director Samuel Minzberg, was elected a Director of the corporation by a majority of shareholders during a special meeting held for that purpose. Mr. Minzberg is a senior partner at the law firm Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP (“Davies”) and is a member of the firm’s management committee. In 2011, the Corporation paid fees to Davies in the amount of approximately $27 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered mainly in legal tax advices ($14 thousand, in 2010, mainly in connection with legal tax advice). Stikeman, Elliott On December 15, 2009, Sidney Horn was named as Corporate Secretary of the Corporation. Mr. Horn is a senior partner at the law firm Stikeman, Elliott LLP (“Stikeman”). In 2012, the Corporation paid fees to Stikeman in the amount of approximately $333 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered mainly in connection with general matters and financings. In 2011, the Corporation paid fees to Stikeman in the amount of approximately $225 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered mainly in connection with general corporate matters, financings and the option agreement with Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. In 2010, the Corporation paid fees to Stikeman in the amount of approximately $626 thousand (including taxes) for professional services rendered, mainly in connection with the acquisition of Louvem Mines, the completion of an overnight marketed public offering of 3,300,000 common shares of Richmont and for general corporate purposes. Oxbridge Aviation On May 14, 2009, Mr. H. Greg Chamandy was appointed as Director of the Corporation and subsequently Executive Chairman of the Board. Oxbridge Aviation is owned by Mr. H. Greg Chamandy. In 2011, the Corporation paid fees to Oxbridge Aviation in the amount of approximately $4 thousand for a meeting of the Board of Directors in Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec), ($3 thousand, in 2010). 107 Subsequent Transaction See “ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION - B. Significant Change” for a discussion of a February 1, 2012 transaction with the Vice Chairman of the Board and two members of his immediate family. C. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information The following consolidated financial statements of the Corporation are attached to this Annual Report: Independent Auditor’s report of registered public accounting firm dated February 20, 2013 on Internal Control over financial reporting and on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for its 2011 fiscal year, as required by the Accounting Standards Board of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. IFRS requires that all effective standards be retrospectively applied as of the reporting date, which for the Corporation is December 31, 2011. Several important differences exist between the new accounting methods applied under IFRS, the accounting methods previously applied under Canadian GAAP, and the accounting methods under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the financial information presented under IFRS is not comparable in all respects with financial information that is prepared in accordance with either Canadian GAAP or US GAAP. The Corporation has not declared or paid any dividends on its common shares since its incorporation. Richmont Mines has no current plans to pay dividends on its common shares. Its present policy is to retain earnings to finance its capital expenditures program. In the future, the Board of Directors may declare dividends according to its assessment of the financial position of the Corporation, taking into account its financing requirements for future growth and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant in the circumstances. The Corporation had no export sales during 2012. Except for the two litigation matters discussed above in the section entitled “Commitments and contingencies,” the Corporation knows of no active, pending or overtly threatened legal or arbitration proceeding to which the Corporation is a party or to which any of its properties is subject which may have, or has had in the recent past, a significant effect on the Corporation’s financial position or profitability. B. Significant Change The Corporation has no significant change since the date of the annual financial statements included. ITEM 9.

Memorandum and Articles of Association The Corporation was incorporated pursuant to Part 1A of the Companies Act (Quebec) on February 12, 1981 (File number 1843-2286) under the name Ressources Minières Rouyn inc. by Article of Amendment filed February 10, 1987 the Corporation added the English version Rouyn Mining Resources Inc. and by another amendment filed with the Government of Quebec on June 20, 1991, the Corporation changed its name to Richmont Mines Inc., now governed by the Business Corporations Act (Quebec) (the “Business Corporations Act”) which replaced the Companies Act (Quebec) on February 14, 2011. The Articles of the Corporation are registered by the Government of Quebec in register S02473, folio 10. The Corporation has perpetual duration and no specific objects or purposes are set forth in its Articles or ByLaws. Amendments to Articles On February 14, 2011, the Companies Act (Quebec) was replaced by the new Business Corporations Act (Quebec) (the “Business Corporations Act”). The new Business Corporations Act provides that a corporation may hold shareholder meetings at a place outside of the Province of Quebec if the Articles so allow. The Board of Directors believes that it would be beneficial both to the Corporation and its shareholders to give the Board flexibility to permit shareholder meetings to be held outside of the Province of Quebec. The new Business Corporations Act further provides that if the Articles so allow, the directors of a corporation that is a reporting issuer may appoint one or more additional directors to hold office for a term expiring not later than the close of the annual shareholders meeting following their appointment, provided that the total number of directors so appointed may not exceed one third of the number of directors elected at the annual shareholders meeting preceding their appointment. The Board believes that it would be beneficial to the Corporation and its shareholders to give the Board flexibility to add directors who possess expertise and knowledge relevant to the 111 Corporation’s operations from time to time between two annual shareholder meetings. Pursuant to its Articles, the business of the Corporation is managed by a Board of Directors composed of a maximum of eleven directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors, at its meeting held on March 28, 2011, adopted a resolution to amend the Articles approving the foregoing proposed amendments subject to the receipt of the approval of shareholders. In accordance with the Business Corporations Act, the proposed amendments to the Articles were approved by the shareholders at the Annual and Special General Meeting of shareholders held on May 13, 2011 (the “Meeting”). By-Laws The Corporation updated its General By-laws enacted by the Board of Directors on February 25, 1981, which have been amended since and are now known as the “By-laws”. To align the By-laws with the terminology and principles set out in the new Business Corporations Act as well as governance best practices, the Board of Directors elected to adopt the By-laws on April 5, 2012. (For more information, see exhibit 1.3 of 2011 Annual Report). Matters affecting shareholders and the calling and holding of their meetings An annual meeting of shareholders must be held not later than 15 months after the last preceding annual meeting; An annual or special shareholders meeting may be held at the Corporation head office or at any other location that the Directors may determine from time to time; In accordance with the Business Corporations Act, a notice of any special shareholders meeting indicates the date, time and place of the meeting and the business to be transacted and contains the text of any special resolution to be submitted to the meeting; In accordance with the Business Corporations Act, a notice of any annual or special shareholders meeting must be given to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting and to each director not less than 21 days and not more than 60 days before the date of the meeting; The required quorum to hold a shareholders meeting has been increased to 25% of the issued and outstanding shares carrying the right to vote at the meeting and held by at least two shareholders present in person or represented by proxyholders at the beginning of the meeting; In accordance with the Business Corporations Act, if a shareholders meeting is adjourned for an aggregate of 30 days or more, notice must be given as for an original meeting; The business of the Board of Directors and the powers of directors The minimum and maximum number of directors are those indicated in the articles of the Corporation as amended from time to time; The By-laws allow the directors to appoint one or more additional directors to hold office for a term expiring not later than the close of the next annual shareholders meeting following their appointment; In accordance with the Business Corporations Act, the powers of the Board of Directors have been restated to provide for the exercise by the Board of Directors of all the powers necessary to manage, or supervise the management of, the business and affairs of the Corporation. Except to the extent provided by the Business Corporations Act, such powers may be exercised without shareholder approval and may be delegated to a director, an officer or one or more committees of the Board of Directors; Without limiting the foregoing, the By-laws confirm that the Board of Directors may, among other things, borrow money, issue, reissue, sell or hypothecate the Corporation’s debt obligations, have the Corporation enter into a suretyship to secure performance of an obligation of any person and hypothecate all or any of its property, owned or subsequently acquired, to secure any obligation; 112 A director who is not present at a meeting at which a resolution is adopted is deemed to have consented to the resolution unless the director records his or her dissent in accordance with the Business Corporations Act within 7 days after becoming aware of the resolution; and The By-laws confirm that a majority of the directors in office constitutes a quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors. Provisions regarding conflicts of interest The By-laws are now consistent with the Business Corporations Act in that they state the general principle contained in the legislative provisions dealing with conflicts of interest of directors and referring to the Business Corporations Act for their implementation, including the manner in which a director must disclose his interest in a contract or a transaction to which the Corporation is party. Harmonization of provisions regarding the indemnification of directors and officers: Provisions allowing the Corporation to indemnify directors and officers of the Corporation (or a group in which the Corporation was a shareholder or creditor) have also been amended to be in line with the criteria set out in the Business Corporations Act. Other amendments The Corporation keeps the records required by the Business Corporations Act and the Board of Directors may appoint or remove transfer agents or other agents responsible for keeping such records; Shares are certificated unless the Board of Directors, by resolution, determines that shares of any class or series or certain shares of a given class or series will be uncertificated. The Board of Directors may also, by resolution, determine that a certificated share will become an uncertificated share as soon as the paper certificate is surrendered to the Corporation, directly or by the intermediary of a transfer agent; and The Board of Directors may, from time to time, subject to the laws governing the Corporation, including the Act respecting the transfer of securities and the establishment of security entitlements (R.S.Q. c. T- 11.002), regulate, from time to time or generally, the transfer of the securities of the Corporation; the transfer of uncertificated shares, if any, is subject to the conditions prescribed by law. In accordance with the Business Corporations Act, the By-Laws have been approved and ratified by the shareholders. Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan Introduction The Board of Directors has approved the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan") of the Corporation, (a copy of which has been disclosed in Exhibit "4.2" of 2011 Annual Report), and approved by the shareholders of the Corporation. The Omnibus Plan was drafted to comply with the policies of the TSX and remains subject to any requirements the NYSE MKT may have for the Omnibus Plan to be in compliance with the NYSE standards. The following information is intended as a summary of the Omnibus Plan, and is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed provisions of the Omnibus Plan in the form disclosed as Exhibit "4.2" in 2011 Annual Report. The Omnibus Plan is intended to furnish an incentive to directors, officers, senior executives and other employees of the Corporation, consultants and service providers providing ongoing services to the Corporation ("Eligible Participants", and when such Eligible Participants are granted Awards (as defined below), the "Participants") to continue their services for the Corporation and to encourage such Eligible Participants whose skills, performance and loyalty to the objectives and interests of the Corporation are necessary to its success. 113 The Omnibus Plan will permit the granting of options ("Options"), restricted share units ("RSUs"), share appreciation rights ("SARs") and retention awards ("Retention Awards" and together with the Options, the RSUs and the SARs, the "Awards") to Eligible Participants of the Corporation. The Omnibus Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors. General Terms Applicable to Awards See "ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES - E. Share Ownership". Specific Terms Related to the Options The Board of Directors will (i) set the term of the Options granted under the Omnibus Plan which term cannot exceed ten (10) years and (ii) fix the vesting terms of Options as it deems appropriate at the time of the grant of such Options. Should the expiration date for an Option fall within a period during which designated persons cannot trade in any securities of the Corporation pursuant to the Corporation's policy respecting restrictions on insider trading which is in effect at that time (a "Black-Out Period") or within nine (9) business days following the expiration of a Black-Out Period, the expiry date of the Option shall be extended until that date which is the tenth business day following the end of the Black-Out Period. The exercise price of any Options granted pursuant to the Omnibus Plan will be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of the grant, provided that the exercise price shall not be less than the market value of the common shares at the time of the grant which shall be, if the grant is made during a Black-Out Period, the weighted average trading volume price of the common shares on the TSX for the five (5) trading day period following the last day of such Black-Out Period. If the grant is made outside a Black-Out Period, the market value of the common shares shall be the weighted average trading volume price of the common shares on the TSX for the five (5) trading day period ending on the last trading day before the day on which the Option is granted. Pursuant to the Omnibus Plan, the exercise price may also be such other price as is permitted under the rules of the TSX. With the consent of the Board, a Participant may, rather than exercise the Option which the Participant is entitled to exercise under the Omnibus Plan, elect to exercise such Option, in whole or in part and, in lieu of receiving the common shares to which the exercised Option relate, receive the number of common shares, disregarding fractions, which, when multiplied by the market value of the common shares to which the exercised Option relate, have a value equal to the product of the number of common shares to which the exercised Option relate multiplied by the difference between the market value of such common shares and the price of such Option, less any amount withheld on account of income taxes, which withheld income taxes will be remitted by the Corporation. Specific Terms Related to the RSUs The Board of Directors, will fix the period during which RSUs may vest, a period which period shall not exceed three (3) years after the calendar year in which the RSU is granted (the "Restriction Period"). Each RSU grant will be subject to certain vesting conditions (including performance criteria, if any) such conditions to be determined by the Board of Directors, as the case may be, and to be provided to the Participant under a separate agreement. The vesting of the RSUs may be subject to the expiration of a performance period which corresponds to the period over which the performance criteria, if any, and other vesting conditions will be measured and which shall not end after the Restriction Period (the "Performance Period"). The Participant will be entitled to receive, after the vesting determination date, which is the date on which, after the end of the Performance Period, if any, the Board of Directors, determines that the vesting conditions (including the performance criteria, if any) are met, but no later than the last day of the Restriction Period (the "RSU Vesting Determination Date"), payment for each awarded RSU in the form of the common shares of the Corporation, cash, or a combination of the common shares and cash, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. For the purposes of such payment, the market value of the common shares of the Corporation shall be the 114 weighted average trading volume price of the common shares on the TSX for the five trading day period ending on the last trading day before the day on which the payment is made. Specific Terms Related to the SARs The Board of Directors will (i) set the term of the SARs granted under the Omnibus Plan which term cannot exceed ten (10) years and (ii) fix the vesting terms of SARs, (including performance criteria, if any) as it deems appropriate at the time of the grant of such SARs. Should the expiration date for a SAR fall within a Black-Out Period or within nine (9) business days following the expiration of a Black-Out Period, the expiry date of the SAR shall be extended until that date which is the tenth business day following the end of the Black-Out Period. The exercise price of any SAR granted pursuant to the Omnibus Plan will be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of the grant, provided that the exercise price shall not be less than the market value of the common shares at the time of the grant which shall be, if the grant is made during a Black-Out Period, the weighted average trading volume price of the common shares on the TSX for the five (5) trading day period following the last day of such Black-Out Period. If the grant is made outside a Black-Out Period, the market value of the common shares shall be the weighted average trading volume price of the common shares on the TSX for the five (5) trading day period ending on the last trading day before the day on which the SAR is granted. The exercise of a SAR with respect to any number of common shares of the Corporation shall entitle the Participant to a payment, in cash or common shares, or a combination of cash and common shares, for each SAR, equal to the excess of the market value of the common shares on the effective date of such exercise over the exercise price per SAR. Specific Terms Related to the Retention Awards The Board of Directors will (i) set the term of the Retention Awards granted under the Omnibus Plan and (ii) fix the vesting terms of Retention Awards (including performance criteria, if any) as it deems appropriate at the time of the grant of such Retention Awards. Each Retention Award awarded to a Participant shall entitle the Participant to receive, on the vesting date of the Retention Award, such number of common shares of the Corporation which, when multiplied by the market value of the common shares on the vesting date of the Retention Award, to which the Retention Awards relate, have a value equal to the amount determined by the Board of Directors at the time of the grant (the "Retention Payment"), less any amount withheld on account of income taxes, which withheld income taxes will be remitted by the Corporation. A Participant may, in lieu of receiving the common shares to which the Retention Awards relate, elect to receive, in cash, the Retention Payment, less any amount withheld on account of income taxes, which withheld income taxes will be remitted by the Corporation. Cessation in Case of Grant of Options, SARs and Retention Awards Unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise, Options, SARs or Retention Awards granted under the Omnibus Plan will expire at the earlier of the expiration of the original term of the Options, SARs or Retention Awards, and (i) the effective date of the termination as specified in the notice of termination provided by the Corporation to the Participant that its employment has been terminated for cause; (ii) twelve (12) months after the Participant's death; (iii) three (3) years after the Participant's employment has been terminated for reasons other than for "cause" or by reason of injury or disability, after retirement of a Participant (provided that the Participant does not carry on any activities or business in the mining services business prior to the end of the term of his/her Options, SARs or Retention Awards) or after a Participant becoming eligible to receive long-term disability benefits; or (iv) sixty (60) days following the Participant's termination of employment for any other reason. 115 Cessation in Case of RSU Grant Unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise, upon a Participant's (i) death; (ii) termination of employment for reason of injury or disability; (iii) eligibility to receive long-term disability benefits; (iv) retirement (provided that the Participant does not carry on any activities or business in the mining services business prior to the RSU Vesting Determination Date); (v) leave of absence for a period of more than six (6) months authorized by the Corporation; (vi) termination of employment for reasons other than for "cause" (excluding resignation); the Participant's participation in Omnibus Plan in respect of RSUs shall be immediately terminated, provided however, that all unvested RSUs shall remain in effect until the applicable RSU Vesting Determination Date. On the RSU Vesting Determination Date or any earlier date as may be determined by the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors will evaluate whether the vesting conditions and performance criteria, if any, were met in order to determine the amount of the payment to which the Participant is entitled, if any, in accordance with the following formula: D multiplied by E F where: (i) D is equal to the number of RSUs outstanding in the Participant's account, (ii) E is equal to the number of completed months during the applicable Performance Period, as of the date of the Participant's death, termination, eligibility date to receive long-term disability benefits, election for a leave of absence or retirement (subject to the condition mentioned above), and (iii) F is equal to the total number of months included in the applicable Performance Period. Upon a Participant's employment being terminated for cause or the Participant's resignation, the Participant's participation in the Omnibus Plan shall be immediately terminated and all RSUs credited to such Participant's account that have not vested shall be forfeited and cancelled. Amendment The Board of Directors has the discretion to make amendments to the Omnibus Plan which it may deem necessary, without the consent of the Participants, provided that such amendment shall: (a) not adversely alter or impair any Award previously granted except as permitted by the provisions of Omnibus Plan; (b) be subject to any regulatory approvals including, where required, the approval of the TSX; and (c) be subject to the shareholders' approval, where required, by law or the requirements of the TSX, provided that shareholder approval shall not be required for the following amendments and the Board of Directors may make any changes which may include but are not limited to: (i) amendments of a "housekeeping" nature; (ii) a change to the vesting provisions of any Award; (iii) the introduction or amendment of a cashless exercise feature payable in securities, whether or not such feature provides for a full deduction of the number of underlying securities from the Omnibus Plan reserve; 116 (iv) the addition of a form of financial assistance and any amendment to a financial assistance provision which is adopted; (v) a change to the Eligible Participants under the Omnibus Plan, including a change which would have the potential of broadening or increasing participation by insiders; and (vi) the addition of a deferred or restricted share unit or any other provision which results in Participants receiving securities while no cash consideration is received by the issuer. The Board of Directors shall be required to obtain shareholder approval to make the following amendments: (a) any change to the maximum number of common shares of the Corporation issuable from treasury under the Omnibus Plan, except such increase resulting from any increase in the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation (whether as a result of exercise of Awards or otherwise) and in the event of an adjustment pursuant to the Omnibus Plan; (b) any amendment which reduces the exercise price of any Award after such Awards have been granted or any cancellation of an Award and the substitution of that Award by a new Award with a reduced price, except in the case of an adjustment pursuant to a change in capitalization; (c) any amendment which extends the expiry date of any Award or the Restriction Period of any RSU beyond the original expiry date, except in case of an extension due to a Black-Out Period; (d) any amendment which would permit a change to the Eligible Participants, including a change which would have the potential of broadening or increasing participation by Insiders; (e) any amendment which would permit any Award granted under the Omnibus Plan to be transferable or assignable by any Participant other than by will or by the laws of succession of the domicile of a deceased Participant; (f) any amendment which increases the maximum number of common shares of the Corporation (i) issued to Insiders and Associates of such Insiders under the Omnibus Plan or any other proposed or established share compensation arrangement within one-year period; or (ii) issuable to Insiders and Associates of such Insiders at any time under the Omnibus Plan or any other proposed or established share compensation arrangement; (g) any amendment to the amendment provisions of the Omnibus Plan; and (h) provided that common share of the Corporation held directly or indirectly by Insiders benefiting from such amendments shall be excluded when obtaining such shareholder approval. Impact of a Change of Control Subject to the provisions contained in any employment agreement between a holder of Awards and the Corporation, if (i) any person becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of either the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation or the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally; (ii) any person acquires, directly or indirectly, securities to which is attached the right to elect the majority of the directors of the Corporation; (iii) the Corporation undergoes a liquidation or dissolution or sells all or substantially all of its assets; or (iv) the Corporation is involved in, or becomes subject to, a reorganization, an amalgamation, an arrangement, a take-over bid (as that term is defined in the Securities Act (Québec)) for all of the common shares of the Corporation or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may make such provision for the protection of the rights of the Participants as the Board of Directors, in its discretion, considers appropriate in the circumstances, including, without limitation, changing the performance criteria and/or the vesting conditions for the Awards and/or the date on which any Award expires or 117 the Restricted Period, the Performance Period, the Performance Criteria and/or the vesting conditions for the Awards. Shareholder Approval Shareholders approved the adoption by the Corporation of the Omnibus Plan. The Options granted to Mr. Eberhard Scherkus on April 10, 2012 under the Omnibus Plan, as described in 2011 Annual Report has been ratified and approved. C. Material Contracts Private Placements In October 2011, Richmont completed a private placement of 980,500 common shares at CAN$10.50 per share with the Fonds de solidarité FTQ and the Fonds régional de solidarité Abitibi-Témiscamingue, s.e.c. (collectively, the “Subscribers”), for a total cash consideration of CAN$10.3 million. In addition, the private placement entitled the Subscribers to 245,125 warrants to purchase additional Richmont common shares at an exercise price of CAN$13.00 per common share before December 31, 2012. On February 1st, 2012, Richmont Mines completed a CAN$10 million private placement with Mr. Bob Buchan and two members of his immediate family in the form of convertible debentures. The debentures which had a 5 year maturity with a 7.6% annual interest rate were convertible into Richmont common shares at a conversion price of CAN$12.17 per share at the option of the holders at any time following the date of issuance. On September 24, 2012, Richmont Mines announced the immediate retirement of these debentures held by Mr. Bob Buchan and two members of his immediate family. On September 26, 2012, Richmont Mines Inc. completed a non-brokered private placement with four institutional funds, through which the Corporation issued 5.97 million common shares at CAN$4.35 per share for, a total cash consideration of CAN$26 million. Some Directors and officers subscribed to the private placement for an amount representing less than 2% of the private placement. Acquisition of Louvem Mines Inc. On May 18, 2010, Richmont reached an agreement with Louvem Mines Inc.’s (“Louvem”) shareholders regarding the Corporation’s proposed acquisition of the 30% of the issued and outstanding shares of Louvem that it did not previously own. Under terms of the transaction, 9222-0383 Quebec Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Richmont, and Louvem merged on June 30, 2010, and formed a new corporation of the same name, namely Louvem Mines Inc. (“New Louvem”). On the date of the merger, New Louvem shareholders, other than Richmont, received one Richmont common share for each 5.4 New Louvem shares held. As a result, Richmont issued a total of 1,425,407 common shares at a price of $4.69, which was the closing price on the date of issue. Amended and Restated Shareholders Rights Plan Introduction On March 28, 2011, the Corporation amended and restated the existing shareholder rights plan which was set to terminate in accordance with its terms in 2012 (the “Amended and Restated Rights Plan”). The Amended and Restated Rights Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Corporation at the Meeting (Reference is made at Item 19. in Exhibit 2.2 of 2011 Annual Report). 118 Background A shareholder rights plan was adopted by the Corporation’s shareholders in 2002 and, in accordance with the terms set out at that time, the Omnibus Plan required ratification at the Corporation’s annual meetings in 2005, 2008 and 2011, and would expire in April 2012. In lieu of shareholders ratifying the Omnibus Plan in 2011 for one year only (the Omnibus Plan expires in 2012), the Board of Directors thought it appropriate to bring the shareholder rights plan up to date. Consequently, a new shareholder rights plan, which will expire in 2021 (10 years following the effective date). This plan needs to be reconfirmed at every third annual meeting of the Corporation. The primary objective of a rights plan is (a) to prevent creeping acquisition of control or an acquisition of control through a partial bid; (b) to provide adequate time to the Board of Directors and shareholders to properly consider and evaluate any unsolicited takeover bid without undue pressure; (c) to provide the Board of Directors and shareholders adequate time to value of all of the assets of the Corporation and for the Corporation to undertake a value recognition program if necessary to demonstrate the value of one or more assets; (d) to provide the Board of Directors of the Corporation adequate time to explore and develop alternatives for maximizing shareholder value if an unsolicited takeover bid is made for the Corporation and to possibly allow competing bids to emerge; and (e) to provide every shareholder of the Corporation an equal opportunity to participate in such a bid and to ensure the equal treatment of all shareholders of the Corporation under such bid. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan encourages a potential acquiror to proceed either by way of a “Permitted Bid” (as defined in the Amended and Restated Rights Plan), which requires the takeover bid to satisfy certain minimum standards designed to promote fairness, or with the concurrence of the Board of Directors. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan is not intended to prevent takeover bids that treat shareholders of the Corporation fairly and has not been adopted in response to any proposal to acquire control of the Corporation. On the effective Date, one Right (as defined in the Amended and Restated Rights Plan) was issued and attached to each common share of the Corporation then outstanding, and one Right will be issued and attached to each common share of the Corporation subsequently issued. In choosing to implement a rights plan, the Board of Directors considered the legislative framework in Canada governing takeover bids. Under provincial securities legislation, a takeover bid means an offer to acquire voting or equity shares of a corporation, where the shares subject to the offer to acquire, together with shares already owned by the bidder and any person or corporation acting jointly or in concert with the bidder, aggregate 20% or more of the outstanding shares of a corporation, but does not include an offer to acquire if the offer to acquire is a step in an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or arrangement that requires approval in a vote of security holders. The Board of Directors has reviewed the Amended and Restated Rights Plan for conformity with current practices of Canadian companies with respect to shareholder protection rights plan. The Corporation believes that the Amended and Restated Rights Plan preserves the fair treatment of shareholders, is consistent with current best Canadian corporate practice and addresses institutional investor guidelines. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan contains substantially the same terms and conditions as the 2008 Rights Plan and has been updated to meet current best Canadian corporate practices. The existing legislative framework for takeover bids in Canada continues to raise the following concerns for shareholders of the Corporation: Time – Canadian securities laws permit a takeover bid to expire 35 days (21 days in the Province of Quebec) after it is initiated. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is of the view that this is not sufficient time to permit shareholders to consider a takeover bid and make a reasoned and unhurried decision as well as permit directors to evaluate a takeover bid, explore, develop and pursue alternatives which it believes are preferable to the takeover bid or which could maximize shareholder value, and make reasoned recommendations to the shareholders. 119 Pressure to Tender - A shareholder may feel compelled to tender to a takeover bid which the shareholder considers to be inadequate out of concern that in failing to do so, the shareholder may be left with illiquid or minority discounted common shares. This is particularly so in the case of a partial takeover bid for less than all of the common shares, where the bidder wishes to obtain a control position but does not wish to acquire all of the common shares. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan provides the shareholder with a tender approval mechanism which is intended to ensure that the shareholder can separate the decision to tender from the approval or disapproval of a particular takeover bid. Unequal Treatment: Full Value - While existing Canadian securities legislation has substantially addressed many concerns in this regard, there remains the possibility that control of the Corporation may be acquired pursuant to a private agreement in which one or a small group of shareholders dispose of common shares at a premium to market price which premium is not shared with the other shareholders or through a partial bid that may be oppressive to the shareholders of the Corporation.In addition, a person may slowly accumulate common shares through stock exchange acquisitions which may result, over time, in an acquisition of control without payment of fair value for control or a fair sharing of a control premium among all shareholders. Summary The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan for the Corporation which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan and reference is made at Item 19. in Exhibit 2.2 of 2011 Annual Plan. A shareholder or any other interested party may also obtain a copy of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan by contacting the Assistant Corporate Secretary, 161 Avenue Principale, Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, J9X 4P6; telephone (819) 797-2465; fax (819) 797-0166, by consulting the Web site EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar or by consulting the Corporation’s Web Site at www.richmont-mines.com. In the opinion of the Board of Directors, the terms of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan conform to the terms of plans now in place in many other Canadian public companies. Effective Date The effective date of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is March 28, 2011 (the “Effective Date”). Term The Amended and Restated Rights Plan will be in effect until the end of the 2014 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation unless the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is reconfirmed at that meeting by the shareholders. If the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is so reconfirmed, it will then need to be reconfirmed at every third annual meeting. If it is not reconfirmed it will terminate. Even if reconfirmed by the shareholders, it expires ten years after the Effective Date, at which time a new plan can be adopted. Issue of Rights On the Effective Date, one Right was issued and attached to each common share outstanding of the Corporation and will be issued and attached to each common share of the Corporation subsequently issued. Rights Exercise Privilege The Rights will separate from the common shares and will be exercisable 10 trading days (the “Separation Time”) after a person has acquired, or commenced a takeover bid to acquire, 20% or more of the common shares, other than by an acquisition pursuant to a takeover bid permitted by the Amended and Restated Rights Plan (a “Permitted Bid”). The acquisition by any person (an “Acquiring Person”) of 20% of the common shares, other than by way of a Permitted Bid, is referred to as a “Flip-in Event”. Any Rights held by an Acquiring 120 Person will become void upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event. Ten trading days after the occurrence of the Flip-in Event, each Right (other than those held by an Acquiring Person) will permit the purchase by holders of Rights, other than an Acquiring Person, of common shares at a 50% discount to their market price. The issue of the Rights is not initially dilutive. Upon a Flip-in Event occurring and the Rights separating from the common shares, reported earnings per share of the Corporation on a fully diluted or non-diluted basis may be affected. Holders of Rights not exercising their Rights upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event may suffer substantial dilution. Certificates and Transferability Prior to the Separation Time, the Rights are evidenced by a legend imprinted on certificates for the common shares and are not transferable separately from the common shares. From and after the Separation Time, the Rights will be evidenced by Rights certificates which will be transferable and traded separately from the common shares. Permitted Bid Requirements The requirements for a Permitted Bid include the following: the takeover bid must be made by way of a takeover bid circular; the takeover bid must be made to all shareholders of the Corporation as registered on the books of the Corporation, other than the offeror; the takeover bid must be outstanding for a minimum period of 60 days and common shares tendered pursuant to the takeover bid may not be taken up prior to the expiry of the 60 day period and only if at such time more than 50% of the common shares of the Corporation held by shareholders, other than the bidder, its affiliates and persons acting jointly or in concert and certain other persons (the “Independent Shareholders”), have been tendered to the takeover bid and not withdrawn; and if more than 50% of the common shares held by Independent Shareholders are tendered to the takeover bid within the 60 day period, the bidder must make a public announcement of that fact and the takeover bid must remain open for deposits of common shares for not less than ten (10) business days from the date of such public announcement. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan allows for a competing Permitted Bid (a “Competing Permitted Bid”) to be made while a Permitted Bid is in existence. A Competing Permitted Bid must satisfy all the requirements of a Permitted Bid except that it may expire on the same date as the Permitted Bid, subject to the requirement that it be outstanding for a minimum period of thirty-five (35) days. Waiver The Board of Directors, acting in good faith, may, prior to the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, waive the application of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan to a particular Flip-in Event (an “Exempt Acquisition”) where the takeover bid is made by a takeover bid circular to all holders of common shares of the Corporation. When the Board of Directors exercises the waiver power for one takeover bid, the waiver will also apply to any other takeover bid for the Corporation made by a takeover bid circular to all holders of common shares prior to the expiry of any other bid for which the Amended and Restated Rights Plan has been waived. Additionally, the Board of Directors, acting in good faith, may waive the application of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan for any Flip-in Event by written notice delivered to the Rights Agent (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Rights Plan). 121 Redemption The Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders (or holders of Rights if the Separation Time has occurred) voting in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for that purpose may redeem the Rights at $0.000001 per share. Rights will be deemed to have been redeemed by the Board of Directors following completion of a Permitted Bid, Competing Permitted Bid or Exempt Acquisition. Amendment After the Meeting, the Board of Directors may amend the Amended and Restated Rights Plan with the approval of a majority vote of the votes cast by shareholders (or the holders of Rights if the Separation time has occurred) voting in person and by proxy at a meeting duly called for that purpose. The Board of Directors without such approval may correct clerical or typographical errors and, subject to approval at the next meeting of the shareholders (or holders of Rights, as the case may be) may make amendments to the Amended and Restated Rights Plan to maintain its validity due to changes in applicable legislation. Board of Directors The Amended and Restated Rights Plan will not detract from or lessen the duty of the Board of Directors to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Corporation. The Board of Directors, when a Permitted Bid is made, will continue to have the duty and power to take such actions and make such recommendations to shareholders as are considered appropriate. Exemptions for Investment Advisors Investment advisors (for fully managed accounts), trust companies (acting in their capacities as trustees and administrators), statutory bodies whose business includes the management of funds and administrators of registered pension plans acquiring 20% or more of the common shares of the Corporation are exempted from triggering a Flip-in Event, provided that they are not making, or are not part of a group making, a takeover bid. Approval of the Directors The directors of the Corporation have unanimously approved and adopted the Amended and Restated Rights Plan. In adopting the Amended and Restated Rights Plan, the directors concluded, for the reasons discussed above, that it was in the best interests of the Corporation and the shareholders to do so. The directors believe that the Amended and Restated Rights Plan preserves the fair treatment of shareholders of the Corporation, is consistent with Canadian’s corporate practice and addresses institutional investor guidelines. Shareholder Approval The Amended and Restated Rights Plan was confirmed and approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders of the Corporation at the Meeting. D. Exchange Controls There are no governmental laws, decrees, regulations or other legislation in Canada that may affect the export or import of capital, or the remittance of interest, dividends or other payments to non-residents holders of the Corporation’s common shares, except that any remittance of dividends to United States residents is subject to a 15% withholding tax (5% if the shareholder is a corporation owning at least 10% of the common shares of the Corporation) pursuant to Article X of the reciprocal income tax treaty between Canada and the United States. 122 E. Taxation The following summary of the material Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable in respect of the common shares reflect the Corporation’s opinion. The tax consequences to any particular holder of common shares will vary according to the status of that holder as an individual, trust, corporation or member of a partnership, the jurisdiction in which that holder is subject to taxation, the place where that holder is resident and, generally, according to that holder’s particular circumstances. This summary is applicable only to holders who are resident in the United States, have never been resident in Canada, deal at arm’s length with the Corporation, hold their common shares as capital property and who will not use or hold the common shares in carrying on business in Canada. Special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a United States holder that is an issuer that carries on business in Canada and elsewhere. This summary is not exhaustive of all possible income tax consequences. It is not intended as legal or tax advice to any particular holder of common shares and should not be so construed. Each holder should consult his own tax advisor with respect to the income tax consequences applicable to him in his own particular circumstances. Disposition of common shares If a non-resident were to dispose of common shares of the Corporation to another Canadian corporation which deals or is deemed to deal on a non-arm’s length basis with the non-resident and which, immediately after the disposition, is connected with the Corporation (i.e., the non-resident and any person with whom the non-resident does not deal at arm’s length holds directly or indirectly shares representing more than 10% of the voting power and more than 10% of the market value of all issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation), the amount by which the fair market value of any consideration (other than any shares of the purchaser corporation) exceeds the paid-up capital of the common shares sold will be deemed to be taxable as a dividend paid by the purchasing corporation, either immediately or eventually by means of a deduction in computing the paid-up capital of the purchasing corporation, and subject to withholding taxes as described below. Under the Income Tax Act (Canada), a gain from the sale of common shares of the Corporation by a non-resident will not be subject to Canadian tax since the common shares of the Corporation are listed on a prescribed stock exchange, provided the shareholder (and persons who do not deal at arm’s length with the shareholder) have not held a “substantial interest” in the Corporation (25% or more of the shares of any class of the Corporation’s stock) at any time in the five years preceding the disposition. Generally, the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (1980) (the “Treaty”) will exempt from Canadian taxation any capital gain realized by a resident of the United States, provided that the value of the common shares is not derived principally from real property situated in Canada. Dividends In the case of any dividends paid to non-residents, the Canadian tax is withheld by the Corporation, which remits only the net amount to the shareholder. By virtue of Article X of the Treaty, the rate of tax on dividends paid to residents of the United States is generally limited to 15% of the gross dividend (or 5%, in the case of certain corporate shareholders owning at least 10% of the Corporation’s voting shares). In the absence of treaty provisions, the rate of Canadian withholding tax imposed on non-residents is 25% of the gross dividend. Stock dividends received by non-residents from the Corporation are taxable by Canada as ordinary dividends. If a non-resident holder disposes of common shares to the Corporation (unless the Corporation acquired the common shares in the open market in the manner in which shares would normally be purchased by any member of the public), this will result in a deemed dividend to the non-resident holder equal to the amount by which the consideration paid by the Corporation exceeds the paid-up capital of such stock. The amount of such dividend will be subject to withholding tax as described above. 123 Capital Gains A non-resident of Canada is not subject to tax under the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of a capital gain realized upon the disposition of a share of a class that is listed on a prescribed stock exchange unless the share represents “taxable Canadian property” to another holder thereof. A common share of the Corporation will be taxable Canadian property to a non-resident holder if, at any time during the period of five years immediately preceding the disposition, the non-resident holder, persons with whom the non-resident holder did not deal at arm’s length, or the non-resident holder and persons with he/she did not deal at arm’s length owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of the Corporation. In the case of a non-resident holder to whom shares of the Corporation represent taxable Canadian property and who is resident in the United States, American tax will be payable on a capital gain realized on such shares by reason of the Treaty unless the value of such shares is derived principally from real property situated in Canada or the non-resident holder previously held the shares while resident in Canada. However, in such a case, certain transitional relief under the Treaty may be available. Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of common shares of the Corporation by a United States Holder (as defined below) that holds the common shares as a capital asset. The discussion does not cover all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of common shares of the Corporation by particular shareholders, and does not address state, local, foreign or other tax laws. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to persons that own (directly or indirectly) 10 percent or more of the Corporation’s voting shares, nor does this summary discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of persons subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold the common shares as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for United States federal income tax purposes or persons whose functional currency is not the United States dollar). As used herein, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of the Corporation’s common shares that is (i) a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organised under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. The summary is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, as well as on the income tax treaty between the United States and Canada (the “Treaty”), all as currently in effect and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Distributions on common shares of the Corporation General. United States Holders receiving dividend distributions (including constructive dividends) with respect to common shares of the Corporation are required to include in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes the gross amount of such distributions to the extent that the Corporation has current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), without reduction for any Canadian income tax withheld from such distributions. Such income will be foreign source dividend income and generally will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. Canadian tax withheld from such distributions may be credited, subject to certain limitations, against the United States Holder’s United States federal income tax liability or, alternatively, may be deducted in computing the United States Holder’s United States federal taxable income by those who itemize deductions. (See more detailed 124 discussion in the section captioned “Foreign Tax Credit” below). To the extent that distributions exceed current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Corporation, they will be treated first as a return of capital up to the United States Holder’s adjusted basis in the common shares, and then as capital gain. Preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains are applicable to a United States Holder that is an individual, estate or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains for a United States Holder that is a corporation. The Corporation does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with United States Federal income tax accounting principles. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, dividends paid by foreign qualified corporations to non-corporate taxpayers will be taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains, rather than at the higher ordinary income tax rate. A foreign corporation such as the Corporation is a qualified corporation (i) if the corporation is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States which the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) determines is satisfactory and which contains an exchange of information provision, or (ii) to the extent that the dividends are paid with respect to stock that is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. The IRS has ruled that the Treaty is a satisfactory treaty for this purpose. Accordingly, dividends paid with respect to shares of the Corporation should be eligible for the reduced tax rate. Eligibility for the reduced tax rate is dependent on satisfying a holding period and certain other limitations. The reduced tax rate also cannot be claimed with respect to dividends that are included as investment income for purposes of the limitation on the deduction of investment interest. For tax years beginning after 2012, dividends paid to U.S. citizens and residents with modified adjusted gross income above $200,000 ($250,000 for joint returns) also will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax. The 3.8% tax is imposed on the lesser of net investment income or the excess of modified adjusted gross income above $200,000 ($250,000 for joint returns). For trusts the threshold applies at the top marginal bracket, which for 2013 starts at $11,950. There is an exemption for foreign trusts except to the extent the foreign trust has United States beneficiaries. Foreign Currency Dividends. Dividends paid in Canadian dollars will be included in income in a US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day the dividends are received by the United States Holder, regardless of whether the Canadian dollars are converted into US dollars at that time. If dividends received in Canadian dollars are converted into US dollars on the day they are received, the United States Holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the dividend income. A United States Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if it does not convert the amount of such dividend into U.S. dollars on the date of its receipt. Effect of Canadian Withholding Taxes. As discussed above in Taxation, Dividend, under current law payments by the Corporation to foreign investors are subject to a 25% Canadian withholding tax. The rate of withholding applicable to United States Holders that are eligible for benefits under the Treaty generally is reduced to a maximum rate of 15% (except for certain corporate holders). For United States federal income tax purposes, United States Holders will be treated as having received the amount of Canadian taxes withheld by the Corporation, and as then having paid over the withheld taxes to the Canadian taxing authorities. As a result of this rule, the amount of dividend income included in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes by a United States Holder with respect to the payment of dividends may be greater than the amount of cash actually received (or receivable) by the United States Holder from the Corporation with respect to the payment. Foreign Tax Credit Subject to certain limitations, a United States Holder who pays (or has withheld from distributions) Canadian income tax with respect to the ownership of common shares of the Corporation may be entitled, at the option of the United States Holder, to either a deduction or a tax credit for such foreign tax paid or withheld. United States Holders that are eligible for benefits under the Treaty will not be entitled to a foreign tax credit for the amount of Canadian taxes withheld in excess of the 15% maximum rate available under the Treaty, and with respect to which the United States Holder can obtain a refund from the Canadian taxing authorities. The limitation in foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. The rules 125 governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, United States Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances. United States Holders that are accrual basis taxpayers must translate Canadian taxes into United States dollars at a rate equal to the average exchange rate for the taxable year in which the taxes accrue, while all United States Holders must translate taxable dividend income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date received. This difference in exchange rates may reduce the U.S. dollar value of the credits for Canadian taxes relative to the United States Holder’s United States federal income tax liability attributable to a dividend. Disposition of common shares of the Corporation A United States Holder will recognize gain or loss from the sale of common shares of the Corporation equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received, and (ii) the shareholder’s tax basis in the common shares of the Corporation. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares are a capital asset in the hands of the United States Holder, which will be a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss depending upon the holding period of the United States Holder. Gains and losses are netted and combined according to special rules in arriving at the overall capital gain or loss for a particular tax year. Deductions for net capital losses are subject to significant limitations. For United States Holders that are not corporations, net capital loss may be offset against up to $3,000 of ordinary income each tax year, and any unused portion of such net capital loss may be carried over to be used in later tax years until such net capital loss is thereby exhausted. For United States Holders that are corporations (other than corporations subject to Subchapter S of the Code), an unused net capital loss may be carried back three years from the loss year and carried forward from the loss year to be offset against capital gains until the earlier of five years or the exhaustion of the net capital loss. As with dividends, for tax years beginning after 2012, capital gains of U.S. citizens and residents with modified adjusted gross income above $200,000 ($250,000 for joint returns) will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Payments of dividends or other proceeds with respect to common shares of the Corporation by a United States paying agent or other United States intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the United States Holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding at a rate of 28 per cent may apply to these payments if the United States Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of foreign or other exempt status or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its United States federal income tax returns. Certain United States Holders (including, among others, corporations) are not subject to backup withholding. United States Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining exemption. F .
