ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Important risk factors that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations are described below. These factors are not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, development and result of the Company's business. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this discussion, which speaks only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these risk factors which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereon, including without limitation, changes in the Company's business strategy or planned capital expenditures, store growth plans, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. - - CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN REVENUES. Although the Company's customer base commonly uses its products and services, the Company's failure to meet changing demands of its customers could result in a significant decrease in its revenues. - - CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL RULES AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SPECIALTY FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S LENDING ACTIVITIES. The Company's lending is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing requirements under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations. New laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the Company's lending activities. THE COMPANY'S CSO REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT UPON UNAFFILIATED LENDERS' ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO MAKE LOANS TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS. The loss of the relationships with its unaffiliated lenders could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and earnings. - - ACHIEVEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO OPEN AND ACQUIRE NEW STORES. The Company's expansion program is subject to numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled, such as identifying acceptable locations or attractive acquisition targets and the Company's ability to attract, train and retain qualified store associates. - - FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S SALES, PAWN LOAN BALANCES, SALES MARGINS, PAWN REDEMPTION RATES, AND SIGNATURE LOAN DEFAULT AND COLLECTION RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS. The Company regularly experiences fluctuations in these operating metrics. Changes in any of these factors, as might be caused by changes in the economic environment or a significant decrease in gold prices, could materially and adversely affect the Company's profitability and ability to achieve its planned results. - - CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COULD LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS PLANS. The Company requires continued access to capital; a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve its planned growth and operating results. Similarly, if actual costs to build new stores significantly exceed planned costs, this could materially restrict the Company's ability to build new stores or to operate new stores profitably. The Company's credit agreement also limits the allowable amount of capital expenditures in any given fiscal year, which could limit the Company's ability to build all planned new stores. - - CHANGES IN COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS PLANS. The Company encounters significant competition in connection with its lending and retail operations from other pawnshops, cash advance companies and other forms of financial institutions and other retailers, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than the Company. Significant increases in these competitive influences could adversely affect the Company's operations through a decrease in the number or quality of signature and pawn loans or the Company's ability to liquidate forfeited collateral at acceptable margins. 16 - - THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTIONS. From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation and regulatory actions. The Company is currently a defendant in several actions. Although the Company believes the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operation or liquidity, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these actions. - - A FAILURE IN THE COMPANY'S INFORMATION SYSTEMS COULD PREVENT IT FROM EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING ITS BUSINESS OR SERVING ITS CUSTOMERS. We rely on our information systems to manage and control our stores and business. Our back-up systems and security measures could fail to prevent a disruption in the availability of our information systems. Any disruption in the availability of our information systems could adversely affect our operation, the ability to serve our customers and our results of operations. - - A FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY AND ITS INVESTORS' CONFIDENCE IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. Effective internal controls and disclosure controls and processes are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud, and any failure in those controls could have a material negative impact on our financial results and the price of the Company's stock. - - ONE PERSON HOLDS VOTING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY AND CONTROLS THE OUTCOME OF ALL MATTERS REQUIRING A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH MAY INFLUENCE THE VALUE OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED STOCK. Mr. Phillip E. Cohen controls all of the Company's Class B Voting Common Stock. He elects all the Company's directors and controls the outcome of all other issues requiring a vote of stockholders. Some investors or potential investors may not like this concentration of control, which may adversely affect the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock. - - THE COMPANY FACES OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED UNDER QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK IN ITEM 7A OF THIS FORM 10-K. - - THE COMPANY ALSO FACES OTHER RISKS INDICATED IN THE COMPANY'S FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
