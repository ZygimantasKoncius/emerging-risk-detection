Item 1A. Risk Factors - --------------------- The following is a summary of the material risks to an investment in the Company's securities. A relatively large portion of our total loan portfolio consists of consumer loans, primarily automobile loans. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to residential lending. At December 31, 2005, consumer loans amounted to $189.6 million, or 25.7% of the total loan portfolio. The vast majority of these are automobile loans. At December 31, 2005, automobile loans totaled $185.8 million. Consumer loans entail greater risks than residential mortgage loans, particularly consumer loans secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles, or loans that are unsecured. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance, since there is a greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation of the underlying collateral. Further, consumer loan repayment is dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Finally, the application of various federal laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on consumer loans in the event of a default. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We originate most of our automobile loans though a single source, and we would be unable to maintain the current high volume of automobile loan originations if we were no longer able to obtain business though this source. In late 1999, we began to originate direct automobile loans over the Internet through an independent online loan referral web site. Currently, an average of $5.7 million of new loans, or 94.4%, of our monthly automobile loan originations, are generated from this referral source. We will generally lend up to 100% of the purchase price of a new or used vehicle. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We intend to continue to increase our origination of multi-family / non-residential mortgage loans as well as commercial loans. These types of loans traditionally involve a higher degree of repayment risk than residential loans. At December 31, 2005, our loan portfolio included $271.6 million of multi-family / non-residential mortgage loans, or 36.8% of our total loan portfolio, representing a 76.1% increase from December 31, 2004. Multi-family / non-residential mortgage loans generally are considered to entail significantly greater risk than that which is involved with residential real estate lending. The repayment of these loans typically is dependent on the successful operations and income stream of the real estate and the borrower. These risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. In addition, multi-family / non-residential real estate lending generally requires substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts compared to one- to four-family residential real estate lending. 26 At December 31, 2005, our loan portfolio included $24.8 million of commercial loans, or 3.4% of our total portfolio, representing a 103.1% increase from December 31, 2004. During 2004, we introduced the availability of both commercial lines of credit and fixed term commercial loans. Commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. Commercial business loans, therefore, have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans. In addition, commercial loans generally carry larger balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers than one- to four-family loans. In addition, commercial lending generally requires substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts compared to residential or non-residential real estate lending. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We have a relatively high percentage of unseasoned commercial and multi-family/non-residential credits, which are considered to pose a potentially greater repayment risk than loans that have been outstanding for a longer period of time. As a result of our strong growth during the past five years, commercial and multi-family / non-residential mortgage loans represent 3.4% and 36.8%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2005. A significant portion of these loans are represented as new credits. Generally, loans that are relatively new, referred to as unseasoned loans, do not have sufficient repayment history to determine the likelihood of repayment in accordance with their terms. At December 31, 2005, 87.8% of these loans are considered unseasoned (i.e., less than three years). - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We intend to continue expanding our branch office network and expenses related to such expansion will negatively impact earnings in future periods. We intend to grow our branch office network, which will expand our geographic reach. As of December 31, 2005, we operated twenty branch offices (including our main office) in Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, and Union counties, New Jersey. The Bank has plans to open three new branches and relocate one branch office in 2006. However, there can be no assurance when, or if, these new offices will open. This growth plan will result in an increase in our fixed assets over such period. The expenses associated with opening new branch offices, in addition to the personnel and operating costs that we will have once such offices open, will significantly increase our non-interest expense in future periods and decrease earnings. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We may not continue to experience the same rate of growth that we have in the past, and we may not be able to successfully manage our current growth. Over the past several years, we have experienced rapid and significant growth. Our total assets have increased by $676.9 million, or 227.9%, from $297.0 million at December 31, 2001, to $973.9 million at December 31, 2005. There can be no assurance that we will continue to experience such rapid growth, or any growth, in the future. If we do experience continued growth, we can not assure you that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage such growth or that our earnings will adequately provide the necessary capital to maintain required regulatory capital levels. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rising interest rates would likely hurt our profits and may affect our ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or undertake other corporate transactions. To be profitable, we must earn more in interest and fees than we pay in interest and expenses. If interest rates rise, the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, may increase more quickly than interest earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment 27 securities. This will reduce our net interest income and thereby reduce our net income in the short-term. In addition, rising interest rates are likely to reduce our income via a reduction in the demand for loans and the value of our investment securities and make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay their loans. As a result, this could restrict the capital resources of Synergy Bank and could require us to contribute additional capital to Synergy Bank or may prevent Synergy Bank from paying dividends to us. This could restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or undertake other corporate transactions. Currently, a material increase in interest rates would have a material adverse effect on our income and regulatory capital. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Increases in market rates of interest are likely to adversely affect our stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2005, Synergy Financial Group, Inc. owned $85.3 million of marketable securities that were held as available-for-sale. Generally accepted accounting principles require that these securities be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Unrealized gains or losses on these securities, that is, the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of these securities, is reflected in stockholders' equity, net of deferred taxes. When interest rates increase, the fair value of Synergy Financial Group, Inc.'s available-for-sale marketable securities generally decreases, which decreases stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2005, Synergy Financial Group, Inc.'s available-for-sale securities portfolio had an unrealized loss, net of taxes, of $1.4 million. Our stockholders' equity is likely to be adversely affected by an increase in market interest rates. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A downturn in our local economy may adversely affect our earnings. Our business of attracting deposits and making loans (other than automobile loans) is primarily conducted within our market area. A downturn in our local economy could reduce the amount of funds available for deposit and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and could negatively impact collateral values. As a result, our earnings could be adversely affected. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We face substantial competition in our attraction of deposits, which is our primary source of funds for lending. Many of our competitors are significantly larger institutions and have greater financial and managerial resources. Our ability to compete successfully is a significant factor affecting our profitability. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation could have a material impact on Synergy Financial Group, Inc., its subsidiaries and their operations.
