The following is a summary of such significant differences. NYSE Corporate Governance Standards POSCOs Corporate Governance Practice Director Independence Independent directors must comprise a majority of the board Our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors must comprise no less than a majority of Outside Directors. Our Outside Directors must meet the criteria for outside directorship set forth under the Securities and Exchange Act of Korea. The majority of our board of directors is independent (as defined in accordance with the New York Stock Exchanges standards), and 9 out of 15 directors are Outside Directors. Nomination/Corporate Governance Committee Listed companies must have a nomination/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors We have not established a separate nomination/ corporate governance committee. However, we maintain a Director Candidate Recommendation Committee composed of three Outside Directors and one Standing Director. Compensation Committee Listed companies must have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors We maintain an Evaluation and Compensation Committee composed of four Outside Directors. Executive Session Listed companies must hold meetings solely attended by non-management directors to more effectively check and balance management directors Our Outside Directors hold meetings solely attended by Outside Directors in accordance with operation guidelines of our board of directors. Audit Committee Listed companies must have an audit committee that is composed of more than three directors and satisfy the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act We maintain an Audit Committee comprised of four Outside Directors who meet the applicable independence criteria set forth under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plan Listed companies must allow its shareholders to exercise their voting rights with respect to any material revision to the companys equity compensation plan We currently have an employee stock ownership program. We previously provided a stock options program for officers and directors, as another equity compensation plan. However, during our annual shareholders meeting in February 2006, our shareholders resolved to terminate the stock option program and amended our articles of incorporations to delete the provision allowing grant of stock options to officers and directors. Consequently we may not grant stock options to officers and directors starting February 24, 2006. Matters related to the Employee Stock Ownership Program are not subject to shareholders approval under Korean law. 48 Table of Contents NYSE Corporate Governance Standards POSCOs Corporate Governance Practice Corporate Governance Guidelines Listed companies must adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines We have adopted a Corporate Governance Charter setting forth our practices with respect to relevant corporate governance matters. Our Corporate Governance Charter is in compliance with Korean law but does not meet all requirements established by the New York Stock Exchange for U.S. companies listed on the exchange. A copy of our Corporate Governance Charter is available on our website at www.posco.co.kr. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Listed companies must adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers We have adopted a Code of Conduct for all directors, officers and employees. A copy of our Code of Conduct is available on our website at www.posco.co.kr. Item 6.D. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 28,297 employees, including 10,774 persons employed by our subsidiaries, almost all of whom were employed within Korea. Of the total number of employees, approximately 80% are technicians and skilled laborers and 20% are administrative staff. We use subcontractors for maintenance, cleaning and transport activities. We had 28,853 employees, including 9,849 persons employed by our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2005, and 27,919 employees, including 8,524 persons employed by our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2004. To improve operational efficiency and increase labor productivity, we plan to reduce the number of our employees in future years through natural attrition. However, we expect the number of persons employed by our subsidiaries in growth industries to increase in the future. We consider our relations with our work force to be excellent. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. Wages of our employees are among the highest of manufacturing companies in Korea. In addition to a base monthly wage, employees receive periodic bonuses and allowances. Base wages are determined annually following consultation between the management and employee representatives, who are currently elected outside the framework of the POSCO labor union. A labor union was formed by our employees in June 1988. Union membership peaked at 19,026 employees at the beginning of 1991, but has steadily declined since then. As of December 31, 2006, only 18 of our employees were members of the POSCO labor union. We maintain a retirement plan, as required by Korean labor law, pursuant to which employees terminating their employment after one year or more of service are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment based on the length of their service and their total compensation at the time of termination. We are required to transfer a portion of retirement and severance benefit amounts accrued by our employees to the National Pension Fund. The amounts so transferred reduce the retirement and severance benefit amounts payable to retiring employees by us at the time of their retirement. We also provide a wide range of fringe benefits to our employees, including housing, housing loans, company- provided hospitals and schools, a company-sponsored pension program, an employee welfare fund, industrial disaster insurance, and cultural and athletic facilities. As of December 31, 2006, our employees owned approximately 1.5% of our common stock through an employee stock ownership association. 49 Table of Contents Item 6.E.

Legal Proceedings Claim against the Fair Trade Commission In December 2000, Hyundai HYSCO requested us to sell hot rolled coils which are necessary in manufacturing cold rolled coils used in the automobile industry to produce car body panels. In response to our refusal to sell hot rolled coils to Hyundai HYSCO, Hyundai Motors announced in January 2001 that it would reduce its purchase of cold rolled products from us. In addition, the Fair Trade Commission began an investigation into a potential anti-competitive action by us. On April 12, 2001, the Fair Trade Commission determined that we were involved in anti-competitive action by refusing to sell our hot rolled coils to Hyundai HYSCO. In addition to issuing a suspension order, the Fair Trade Commission imposed on us a surcharge of Won 1.6 billion. We brought a claim against the Fair Trade Commission but the Seoul High Court rendered its decision against us in August 2002. We appealed to the Supreme Court of Korea in August 2002 and our petition for an injunction against the decision of the Fair Trade Commission was granted in October 2002 in our favor. Our appeal is still pending, and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. 53 Table of Contents Anti-dumping and Countervailing Proceedings and Safeguard Measures We have been subject to a number of anti-dumping and countervailing proceedings in the United States and China. The U.S. and China anti-dumping and countervailing proceedings have not had a material adverse effect on our business and operations. However, there can be no assurance that further increases in or new imposition of countervailing duties, dumping duties, quotas or tariffs on our sales in the United States or China may not have a material adverse effect on our exports to these regions in the future.
