ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE EXPECTED REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS SO THAT THE LOSS OF OR REDUCTIONS IN PURCHASES BY ANY ONE ULTIMATE CUSTOMER COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND LEAD TO LOSSES. During the fiscal year 2009 and each of the previous two fiscal years, we derived, on average, 59% of our revenues from seven programs. Due to the lengthy sales cycles, we believe that these programs, with perhaps the addition of a few other programs, will be the basis for a majority of our revenues in the near-term. The loss of or reductions in purchases by any one of our largest customers due to program cutbacks, competition, or other reasons could materially reduce our revenue base. Annual or quarterly losses have occurred when there are material reductions, gaps or delays in card orders from our largest U.S. or foreign government programs or if such programs were to be reduced in scope, delayed, canceled, or not extended and not replaced by other card orders or other sources of income. We had three customers during fiscal year 2009 that accounted for 25%, 19% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue. WE INCURRED NET LOSSES DURING ALL BUT ONE OF THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE IN THE FUTURE TO OBTAIN PROFITABILITY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. In the past five years, only fiscal year 2006 generated a net income. There can be no assurance that we will generate enough revenues in the near term to attain annual profitability. We are relying principally upon our optical memory card technology to generate future product revenues, earnings, and cash flows. If alternative technologies emerge or if we are otherwise unable to compete, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Annual or quarterly losses would also occur if product revenues do not keep pace with increases in expenses. OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS PROVIDE FOR AN INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES. We typically receive purchase orders where customers have the right to delay or cancel at any time. We have no long-term firm order commitments from any of our largest customers. Therefore delays in orders, contract cancellations or changes in technology decisions could result in decreased revenues and operating losses. Our revenue is predominantly dependent on the receipt of purchase orders on a recurring basis. We do not have contracts with firm commitments for deliveries over an extended period of time. This can create volatility in revenues and earnings. Also, customers may change their technology decisions which could cause further delays or possibly loss of business. As an example, the Border Crossing Card, a U.S. government program, accounted for approximately $1.0 million in revenue during each of the past two fiscal years. However, DHS discontinued the use of optical memory cards for the Border Crossing Card program during fiscal year 2009 in keeping with the requirements of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. OUR OPTICAL MEMORY CARD PRODUCT REVENUES WILL NOT GROW IF WE DO NOT WIN NEW BUSINESS IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD AND IF PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ANGOLAN NATIONAL ID PROGRAM OR THE ITALIAN NATIONAL ID PROGRAM ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED AS ANTICIPATED. There can be no assurance that these programs will be implemented as planned or that we will receive sizable future orders for any of these programs, nor any assurance that we will be able to win any other new business in the U.S. or abroad which is necessary to grow our business to the level we desire. SINCE THE SALES CYCLE FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY LONG AND UNPREDICTABLE, WE HAVE DIFFICULTY PREDICTING WHEN NEW BUSINESS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO REVENUE GROWTH. Because our customers are large government entities, obtaining substantial orders usually involves a lengthy sales cycle, requiring marketing and technical time and expense with no guarantee that substantial orders will result. This long sales cycle results in uncertainties in predicting operating results, particularly on a quarterly basis. In addition, the equipment supply and consulting work we undertake on occasion for the set up of card manufacturing facilities involves substantial time from start to finish, with the potential for obstacles to intervene outside our control such as delays in the construction and readying of the building and site by the customer and the potential for our customer to request changed specifications for the facility’s throughput, so there can be substantial lags between when we sign a contract and receive a deposit and when we complete a project and recognize revenue. 16 WE COULD EXPERIENCE EQUIPMENT, RAW MATERIAL, QUALITY CONTROL, OR OTHER PRODUCTION PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY IN PERIODS OF INCREASING VOLUME. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our projected card manufacturing capacity if and when customer orders grow significantly. We have made and may continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand our card manufacturing capacity dependant upon projected volume. However, since customer demand is difficult to predict and can be terminated at any time, and we generally wait for such demand to materialize prior to making capital expenditure commitments, we may be unable to ramp up our production quickly enough to fill new customer orders in a timely fashion. This could cause us to lose new business and possibly existing business. In addition, if we overestimate customer demand, we could incur significant costs, including inventory write-offs, from creating excess capacity such as was the case during fiscal years 2007 and 2008. When purchasing raw materials for our anticipated optical card demand, we take into consideration the order-to-delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such raw materials. If we over-estimate customer demand, excess raw material inventory and inventory write-offs can result. We may experience manufacturing complications associated with increasing our manufacturing capacity of cards and drives. We may also experience difficulties implementing new manufacturing processes, meeting customers’ quality or international standards requirements, or outsourcing some of our manufacturing. The addition of fixed overhead costs increases our breakeven point and results in lower gross margins unless compensated for by increased product sales. WE ARE CURRENTLY OUR OWN SOLE SOURCE OF OPTICAL MEMORY CARDS AND SEVERAL OF THE STEPS IN OUR CARD MANUFACTURING PROCESS HAVE NO BUILT-IN REDUNDANCY. THEREFORE, WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS, INCLUDING IF CERTAIN MACHINERY WERE TO BREAK DOWN. MUCH OF OUR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT IS COMPRISED OF CUSTOM VERSIONS OF MACHINERY, SOME OF WHICH IS MORE THAN 20 YEARS OLD. IN ADDITION, WE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING OR NOT OBTAINING CERTAIN PROGRAMS SHOULD THEY REQUIRE A SECOND SOURCE. We use a proprietary manufacturing process with custom machinery and several of the steps in our card manufacturing process have no built-in redundancy, or in some cases have the redundancy located in Germany. We are susceptible to supply interruptions when our line goes down or yield decreases when our line malfunctions. Much of our machinery is comprised of customized versions of machinery which has long lead times to replace and may be difficult to maintain or repair, requiring us to be self-reliant. Some of the machinery we use is more than 20 years old and is no longer produced by its manufacturer, requiring us to adapt a newer version to our needs, which would involve additional delay, effort and expense on our part. If current or potential customers require a second source for their card programs (which is a common business practice) they could decide to use one of our competitors that may have multiple sources of supply. This would harm our business and financial results. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO BUY RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON TIME WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE CUSTOMERS, AND OUR REVENUES COULD DECLINE. Most of the raw materials used in the manufacture of optical memory cards are available from one or more qualified suppliers. Such materials include plastic films used in optical memory card production, which are available from one supplier in the U.S. and from multiple foreign suppliers. Processing chemicals, inks and bonding adhesives are obtained from various U.S. and foreign suppliers. However, certain photographic films are commercially available solely from Eastman Kodak Company (“Kodak”) of the United States. No assurance can be given that Kodak will continue to supply such photographic films on a satisfactory basis and in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements. If Kodak were to discontinue manufacturing the film from which our optical media is made, we would endeavor to establish an alternate supplier for such film, although the purchase price could increase and reliability and quality could decrease from a new supplier. No assurance can be given that there will be adequate demand to attract a second source. In addition, an alternate supplier could encounter technical issues in producing the film as there may be know-how and manufacturing expertise which Kodak has developed over the years which an alternate supplier may have difficulty replicating. We currently have on hand and on order enough film inventory to produce cards for orders projected over the next nine to fifteen months. If Kodak announced that it would no longer offer film, we would request that Kodak provide us with a last-buy opportunity which we would plan to take maximum advantage of, although no assurance can be given that Kodak would provide us with such an opportunity. There can be no assurance that we would be able to procure an alternate source of supply of these films on reasonable terms or at all, which could force us to design new cards using different materials. This could be very disruptive to our business, result in increased costs and lower quality products, and could cause us to lose sales. Further, we are researching other materials for use as optical memory card media. THE VOLATILITY IN THE COST OF PETROLEUM CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING INCOME AND GROSS MARGIN IF THIS RESULTS IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTION MATERIALS SUCH AS THE POLYCARBONATE-BASED PRODUCTS. The polycarbonate raw material for our cards is petroleum based. The volatility in the cost of petroleum could impact our costs for such raw material and also lead to higher energy bills for running our manufacturing facilities. Long-term increases in petroleum prices could lead to a decline in our gross margins and income unless we are able to adjust our selling prices. 17 AN INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF READ/WRITE DRIVE PARTS OR DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN READ/WRITE DRIVE ASSEMBLY COULD CAUSE A DELAY IN DELIVERIES OF DRIVES AND OPTICAL MEMORY CARDS AND A POSSIBLE LOSS OF SALES, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. Several major components of our read/write drive are designed specifically for our products. For example, the optical recording head for the current drive is a part obtained from one supplier; and at current production volumes, it is not economical to have more than one supplier for this custom component. While we carry a large inventory of safety stock for this item, any delays in or inability to obtain parts from this supplier could cause us to lose revenues while we source a second supplier. The ability to produce read/write drives in high-volume, if required, will be dependent upon maintaining or developing sources of supply of components that meet our requirements for high volume, quality, and cost. In addition, we could encounter quality control or other production problems at high-volume production of read/write drives. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE SECURE ID CARD INDUSTRY AND IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY GENERALLY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR FUTURE BUSINESS. The secure ID technology industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing product evolution. The future success and growth of our business will require the ability to maintain and enhance the technological capabilities of the LaserCard product line. There can be no assurance that our products currently sold or under development will remain competitive or provide sustained revenue growth. SEVERAL OF OUR PROGRAMS INVOLVE OUR CARDS AS PART OF A SOLUTION WHICH INCLUDES TECHNOLOGIES OF THIRD PARTIES. DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY THESE THIRD PARTIES COULD CAUSE OUR ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS, GENERALLY GOVERNMENTS, TO FIND FAULT IN OPTICAL CARDS AND SWITCH TO OTHER SOLUTIONS EVEN IF OUR OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THE ROOT CAUSE OF ANY FAULT. In certain of our current programs various third-party technologies such as contact or contactless chips are added to our cards. The embedding or addition of other technologies to the LaserCard optical memory card, especially when contracted to independent third parties, could potentially lead to technical, compatibility and other issues. In such circumstances, it may be difficult to determine whether a fault originated with our technology or that of a co-supplier or the person embedding or adding the third party technology to our cards. If such faults occur, they could be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to resolve. Such difficulties could lead to our ultimate customers, the foreign governments, switching to other technologies even if optical technology is not the root cause of the fault(s). The resulting loss of customers would adversely affect our revenues. WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF CARD PROGRAMS AND THEIR METHOD OF IMPLEMENTATION MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL DUE TO QUALITY OR COST. We mainly sell to VARs and system integrators who in turn sell solutions to the end customer. The integrators may not follow the recommendations we provide for the handling, processing, and printing on our cards and working with the end-user in the card issuing process. This could lead to low quality, high costs, or both resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of the contract. In order to mitigate this risk, we work to train the integrators to avoid such situations but cannot control their work and may not always be successful in our training. We plan to continue to offer this support and then transition the card issuing process to local resources once the program is running successfully. There can be no assurance that issues with our systems integrators in the future will not damage our reputation, reduce our revenues, or cause us to lose various governmental programs. OUR OPTICAL MEMORY CARDS HAVE A COMPLEX STRUCTURE THAT REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO MEET INCREASINGLY STRINGENT PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE AND COULD IN THE FUTURE AGREE TO CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED IN INDEPENDENTLY PUBLISHED STANDARDS. THIS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF MANUFACTURING CARDS OR RESULT IN ACCEPTING RETURNS OR GIVING CREDITS TO THE CUSTOMER IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS. MANY CUSTOMERS MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE INVENTORY WHICH INCREASES THIS RISK. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet customers’ quality or standards requirements consistently. This could lead to high manufacturing costs due to low product yields or unexpected product returns. We employ a rigorous quality control procedure, are ISO 9001:2000 certified and we strive to deliver product that meets published standards and customer expectations. Even so, we cannot give assurance that our products will meet customer expectations in all cases. We have in the past, and we may in the future, replace product held by the customer or give credit for products previously delivered. Any failure to meet our customers’ standards may harm our reputation, result in product returns and inventory write downs, and may cause us to lose sales and customers. 18 IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE OUR TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH COULD WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, REDUCE REVENUES, OR INCREASE COSTS. We use a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as U.S. law. Any patents we may obtain may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around any of our issued patents or other intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful. Litigation, or the threat of litigation, may also cause us to have to license third-party technology, which would increase our costs and harm our margins. We cannot predict whether the expiration or invalidation of our patents would result in the introduction of competitive products that would affect our future revenues adversely. However, since our technology is now in the commercial stage, our know-how and experience in volume card production, system development and software capabilities, brand-name recognition within our card markets, and well-known status in the optical memory cards market may be of greater importance than our patents. At this time, we believe that our existing patent portfolio is helpful but is no longer essential for maintaining the LaserCard optical memory card’s market position. THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE COMPETITIVE, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, REVENUES COULD DECLINE OR FAIL TO GROW. Our optical memory cards may compete with optical memory cards that can be manufactured and sold by three of our licensees (although none is currently doing so) and with other types of portable data storage technologies applied to ID cards. These may include RF enabled chip and RFID tags. Financial, personnel and marketing resources of some of the competing companies are significantly greater than our resources. Competitive product factors include system/card portability, interoperability, price-performance ratio of cards and associated equipment, durability, environmental tolerance, and card security. Although we believe our cards offer key technological and security advantages for certain applications, the current price of optical card read/write drives could be a competitive disadvantage in some of our targeted markets. Nevertheless, we believe the cost of ownership of an optical card system is competitive in applications requiring large populations of cards because of the relatively high overall cost to implement a system based on our major competition, IC cards. THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY. The price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility, which may be due to fluctuations in revenues, earnings, liquidity, press coverage, analyst recommendations, financial market interest, trading volume, and stock market conditions, as well as changes in technology and customer demand and preferences. As a result, our stock price might be low at the time a stockholder wants to sell the stock. For example, during fiscal year 2009 our stock price fluctuated from a high of $9.73 per share to a low of $2.05 per share. Also, since we have a relatively low number of shares outstanding (approximately 12 million shares) there will be more volatility in our stock if one or two major holders, for example, large institutional holders, attempt to sell a large number of shares in the open market. Furthermore, our trading volume is often small, meaning that a few trades may have disproportionate influence on our stock price. In addition, someone seeking to liquidate a sizeable position in our stock may have difficulty doing so except over an extended period or privately at a discount. Thus, if one or more stockholders were to sell or attempt to sell a large number of its shares within a short period of time, such sale or attempt could cause our stock price to decline. There can be no guarantee that stockholders will be able to sell the shares that they acquired at a price per share equal to or greater than the price they paid for the stock. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. Part of the manufacturing process of certain LaserCard products that we sell outside the U.S. takes place in our operations in Germany. Also, some of the raw materials we use to manufacture optical memory cards are sourced in Europe. These costs are denominated in Euros, the currency used in much of Europe. However, when we sell our finished products, the prices that we charge are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure when the exchange rate for Euros increases in relation to the U.S. dollar. As of March 31, 2009, we had not entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge against or potentially minimize the foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions other than those related to inter-company payables and receivables. The losses on foreign currency exchange related to purchase transactions and intercompany receivables for both fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were immaterial, but we give no assurance that such losses will not be significant in the future. 19 WE HAVE INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CASH IN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (“ARS”), WHICH BECAME ILLIQUID IN FEBRUARY 2008. WE COULD RECORD FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS DECLINES FURTHER. As of March 31, 2009, we held $13.5 million par value (with a fair value of approximately $12.2 million), of marketable securities consisting of ARS. Given the disruptions in the credit markets and the fact that the liquidity for these types of securities remains uncertain, as of March 31, 2009, we classified all of our ARS as noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next twelve months is uncertain. We accepted a rights offering by UBS in December 2008. The Company elected to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“SFAS No. 159”) on the Put Option received in the rights offering and elected to treat our ARS portfolio from available-for-sale to trading securities. The transfer resulted in the reversal of prior unrealized losses, net of taxes, on the ARS from accumulated other comprehensive income and the recording of an other-than temporary impairment of approximately $1.3 million on the $13.5 million (par value) portion of our ARS portfolio and the recognition of a benefit of approximately $1 million related to the Put Option provided by the settlement. The transfer to trading securities reflects management’s intent to exercise its Put Option during the period June 30, 2010 through July 3, 2012. We will analyze the fair value of the ARS at each balance sheet date. In order to validate the fair value estimate of these securities, we incorporated assumptions such as credit quality or financial standing of the issuer, final stated maturities, estimates on the probability of the issue being called prior to final maturity, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates, liquidity risk premium, and broker quotes from independent valuators using widely accepted financial models. We believe that these are reasonable estimates reflecting the unique circumstances of the subject SLARS and the method of valuing the put as a forward contract is reasonable. However, due to the unprecedented issues surrounding the global credit market, these assumptions may change considerably and may result in further impairment charges. If UBS is insolvent on June 30, 2010 or otherwise unable to fulfill its obligations described in the October 7, 2008 prospectus, we may incur additional losses on the ARS especially if we would need to liquidate them over a short period of time. THE AMOUNT OF OUR NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS (“NOLS”) IS UNCERTAIN AND PRIOR TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN A PARTY AND FUTURE TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH WE MAY BECOME A PARTY, INCLUDING STOCK ISSUANCES AND CERTAIN SHAREHOLDER STOCK TRANSACTIONS, MAY JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO USE SOME OR ALL OF OUR NOLS. In addition, California and certain states have recently suspended or are considering suspending, the ability to use NOLs in future years and this could adversely affect future operating results. Based on current tax law, we believe we have certain NOLs for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes to offset future taxable income. As of March31, 2009, we had incurred significant losses in the U.S. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we have undergone, or undergo in the future, an ownership change. An ownership change occurs for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if, among other things, stockholders who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock (with certain groups of less-than-5% stockholders treated as a single stockholder for this purpose) increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our common stock by more than fifty percentage points above the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the relevant three-year testing period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation, based upon the value of the Company at the time of the ownership change, on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOLs. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs. To the extent that these NOLs become significantly limited, we expect to be taxed on our income, if any, at the U.S. federal and state statutory rates. As a result, any inability to utilize these NOLs would adversely affect future operating results by the amount of the federal or state taxes that would not have otherwise been payable, having an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the inability to use NOLs would adversely affect our financial condition relative to our financial condition had the NOLs been available. In addition, California and certain states have suspended use of NOLs, and other states are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use state NOLs could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 20 WE SOLD A CARD MANUFACTURING LICENSE UNDER WHICH WE WILL PROVIDE CERTAIN FACTORY SET-UP AND TRAINING SERVICES TO PREVENT GLOBAL OF SLOVENIA. IF WE AND PREVENT GLOBAL ARE SUCCESSFUL, THEY COULD COMPETE WITH US FOR BUSINESS. We are obligated to deliver the contracted manufacturing equipment and installation support to Prevent Global for its to-be-built new card manufacturing facility in Slovenia, to provide a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of 10 million optical cards annually. Our obligation arises under an agreement with Global Investment Group Ltd (“GIG”) which was assumed by Prevent Global in 2007. GIG has recently claimed that it has rights to the agreement, which Prevent Global disputes. It is possible that we, Prevent Global or GIG will commence litigation to enforce rights under this agreement in England, the venue for disputes under the agreement. Any such litigation may be expensive to us and distracting to our management even if we ultimately prevail. In addition, if either Prevent Global or GIG does not perform under the agreement, we may not receive the expected benefits under the agreement, including profits and payment of past due amount. Even if Prevent Global is able to maintain its position as contractual counterparty, no assurance can be given that Prevent Global will make a plant site ready to accept equipment deliveries; that Prevent Global will arrange for pick-up of the equipment; that the equipment will be able to be successfully installed so that the plant becomes operational; or that Prevent Global will raise the financing required to complete the project and commence operations. Assuming the plant becomes operational, we will also be assigning a person to be on site through March 31, 2011, and throughout the license term if the option is elected by Prevent Global, to monitor quality, security, and operational procedures, with a mutual goal that the facility and the cards made in Slovenia conform to our standards. If cards are not produced in conformance with our quality standards, the reputation and marketability of optical memory card technology could be damaged. If the factory does not become operational and produce quality cards in high volume, or if Prevent Global is unable to raise sufficient capital to build, equip and operate this facility, we would not obtain the hoped-for benefits--including ongoing royalties, sales of raw materials to Prevent Global, and expansion of the European market. On the other hand, if and when the factory is successfully manufacturing the cards in high volume, it could compete against us for business in certain territories, which could reduce our potential card revenues if the market does not expand. Revenue on the contract will begin to be recognized when the equipment has been installed and is operating according to specification and training completed, which date is dependent in part on Prevent Global providing a facility in Slovenia. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT, RETAIN OR INTEGRATE KEY PERSONNEL, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM SUCCEEDING. We may not be able to retain our key personnel or attract other qualified personnel in the future. Our success will depend upon the continued service of key management personnel. The loss of services of any of the key members of our management team, including our chief executive officer, chief operating officer, vice president of finance and chief financial officer, the managing directors of our German operations, or our vice president of marketing, or our failure to attract and retain other key personnel could disrupt operations and have a negative effect on employee productivity and morale, thus decreasing production and harming our financial results. In addition, the competition to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel is intense. OUR CALIFORNIA FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN AN EARTHQUAKE ZONE AND THESE OPERATIONS COULD BE INTERRUPTED IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, OR OTHER DISASTER. Our card manufacturing, corporate headquarters, and drive assembly operations, administrative, and product development activities are located near major earthquake fault lines. In the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. Likewise, fires, floods, or other events could similarly disrupt our operations and interrupt our business. FOREIGN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We sell our products worldwide and, therefore, our products must comply with various domestic and international laws, regulations and standards and our business could be subject to risks due to changes in a country’s or region’s political, regulatory or economic conditions. We may experience difficulty in securing required approvals, licenses or permits on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Differing tax laws and changes in those laws may also affect our future results of operations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or industry standards, or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected products to become impractical or otherwise adversely affect our ability to produce or market our products. Failure to comply with existing or new laws or regulations, including export and import restrictions and barriers, or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals, licenses or permits could result in lost sales or increased costs. 21 PANDEMICS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. The occurrence of a pandemic such as the Swine Flu coupled with the lack of government readiness and support in those countries where we do business could temporarily impede our revenue growth. ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Acts of terrorism, acts of war, and other events may cause damage or disruption to our properties, business, employees, suppliers, distributors, resellers, and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. AS A RESULT OF OUR REQUIRED ANNUAL EVALUATION OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE MAY IDENTIFY INTERNAL CONTROL WEAKNESSES NEEDING REMEDIATION, WHICH COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION. We have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008. Although our assessment, testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of March 31, 2009 and 2008, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. Because of the inherent limitation of disclosure controls, no evaluation of such controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. If our internal controls are found to be ineffective in future periods, our reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations, both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income. IF WE ENGAGED IN ACQUISITIONS, WE WOULD INCUR A VARIETY OF COSTS AND THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS MIGHT NEVER BE REALIZED. In recent times, we have not made any acquisitions other than Challenge Card Design and Cards & More in March 2004 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future. Future acquisitions may result in substantial dilution of our current stockholders’ percentage ownership; expenditure of our current limited cash resources; incurrence of debt, amortization of expenses related to goodwill, research and development and other intangible assets or large and immediate write-offs; and assumption of liabilities. Our operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks, including assimilating employees, operations, technologies and products; unanticipated costs; diverting our management’s time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our business; entering markets in which we have no or limited direct experience; potentially losing key employees from the acquired company; and adversely effecting our existing business relationships. If we fail to adequately manage these risks, we may not achieve the intended benefit of any acquisition. WE MAY FACE RISKS FROM OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL SALES. Our LaserCard products are used in countries around the world in addition to the United States, such as Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Angola, Italy, India, Costa Rica and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. International sales accounted for approximately 84% of our revenues for the year ended March 31, 2009, 78% for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 74% for the year ended March 31, 2007. We also operate a German subsidiary. Our international operations are subject to the following risks, among others: difficulty with staffing and managing international operations; transportation and supply chain disruptions and increased transportation expense as a result of epidemics, terrorist activity, acts of war or hostility, increased security and less developed infrastructure; political and economic uncertainty caused by changes in governments, epidemics, terrorism or acts of war or hostility; difficulties in collecting receivables and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and potentially adverse tax consequences. For example, our German subsidiary, CCD, entered into a contract to provide consulting services and equipment to the Golden Chip Company (“GCC”) of Saudi Arabia to enable GCC to establish a card manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. After many delays on the part of GCC, GCC has alleged that CCD failed to perform under this contract and has demanded payment of damages. CCD has disputed this claim and reserved the right to terminate the contract and claim damages against GCC for lost profits. GCC has threatened to bring arbitration proceedings in London, United Kingdom, to enforce its rights under the agreement. Litigation, including arbitration, can be expensive, especially in the United Kingdom, and can cause significant management distraction, even if we ultimately prevail. 22 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM
