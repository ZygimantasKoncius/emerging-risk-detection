Risk FactorsThe Groups results of operations and financial condition could be harmed by changes in exchange rates. 51 Table of Contents In 2004, approximately 45% of the Groups net sales (45% in 2003) and 38% of the Groups operating income (34% in 2003) were outside the euro zone and therefore subject to exchange rate risk. 2003 2004 In millions ofeuro As a % ofGroup figures In millionsof euro As a % ofGroup figures Net sales: of subsidiaries located in euro zone 7,222 55% 7,535 55% of subsidiaries located outside euro zone 5,909 45% 6,165 45% Group total net sales 13,131 100% 13,700 100% Operating income: of subsidiaries located in euro zone 1,059 66% 1,057 62% of subsidiaries located outside euro zone 545 34% 648 38% Group total operating income 1,604 100% 1,705 100% Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees Directors and Senior Management In accordance with French law governing a société anonyme, a form of limited liability company, the Companys activities are managed by its board of directors, or conseil dadministration, and by its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who has full executive authority to manage the activities of the Company, subject to the prior authorization of the board of directors or of the Companys shareholders for certain decisions specified by law. Under French company law, the board of directors may elect one person to assume the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or split these functions between two different persons (either the Chairman of the Board or another natural person bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer or Directeur Général). The Companys bylaws were modified at the extraordinary shareholders meeting of April 25, 2002 to provide for such a choice. According to the Companys bylaws, the choice is made by the board of directors deciding with a majority of all its members. The board of directors has decided not to split these two functions, which are currently performed by the same person. French law and the Companys bylaws permit the board of directors to delegate general or specific powers to up to five people (Directeurs Généraux Délégués or Assistant Managing Directors). The Chief Executive Officer proposes the appointment of the Directeurs Généraux Délégués or Assistant Managing Directors to the board of directors and the board of directors determines their specific management powers and responsibilities. Under French law, an Assistant Managing Director, like the Chief Executive Officer, has broad powers to represent and bind the Company in dealings with third parties. An Assistant Managing Director may be removed by the board of directors at any time upon proposal of the Chief Executive Officer. An Assistant Managing Director may be held individually responsible for his/her actions if they are deemed contrary to the Companys interests. Pursuant to the Companys bylaws, in addition to the appointment of Directeurs Généraux Délégués, the board of directors can appoint one or more Vice-Chairmen. The Vice-Chairmans seat comprises no particular powers other than chairing board meetings and general meetings if either the Chairman or the director temporarily acting for the latter, in compliance with law, is absent. In consideration for their services on the board, directors are entitled to receive jetons de présence (directors fees). The total annual amount of jetons de présence is fixed by the shareholders meeting, but the board determines their allocation among the directors. In addition, remuneration may be granted to directors on a 52 Table of Contents case-by-case basis for special assignments. Subject to one exception below, a director may not vote for his or her own remuneration. If he or she does vote, the decision is void. The board may also authorize the reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses as well as other expenses incurred by directors in the corporate interest. The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Assistant Managing Directors are entitled to receive remuneration or other additional amounts in addition to jetons de présence under certain circumstances. Any additional remuneration is determined by the board of directors and therefore, in this case only, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Assistant Managing Directors may vote on a resolution concerning his or her remuneration. Under French law, the board of directors prepares and presents yearly financial statements to the shareholders and calls the shareholders meeting. In addition, the board of directors determines the direction of the Companys activities and oversees its implementation. Meetings of the board of directors, which are held as often as required by the corporate interest, are normally convened and presided over by the Chairman. According to French company law, if the board of directors has not met for over two months, at least one-third of the members of the board may request that the Chairman convene the board regarding matters listed in the agenda for the meeting. A quorum is at least one-half of the members of the board, and decisions are taken by a vote of the majority of the members present, deemed to be present, or represented by other members of the board of directors. The Companys bylaws permit that certain decisions be taken by the board of directors by means of a conference call or video communication. A director may give a proxy to another director by any written or electronic means, but a director cannot represent more than one other member at any particular meeting. Members of the board of directors represented by another member at meetings do not count for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. A director may not vote for an arrangement or contract in which he or she is materially interested. If he or she does vote, the decision will be void. Under French law and the Companys bylaws, the board of directors must give prior authorization for any security, pledge or guarantee by the Company. This authorization is generally granted for a period of one year. If the security, pledge or guarantee has not been previously authorized by the board of directors, it shall have no effect with regard to the Company. Board of Directors Pursuant to French law and the Companys bylaws, the board of directors may consist of three to 18 directors. The Companys bylaws provide that each director is elected by the shareholders at an ordinary general meeting of shareholders for a three-year term and is eligible for reelection upon expiration of such term. The shareholders meeting of April 11, 2003 passed a resolution increasing the aggregate amount of directors fees to  500,000. According to the Groups rules in effect, directors who are also members of the executive committee do not receive directors fees. In 2004, directors were paid a total of approximately  336,000 in directors fees for their attendance at board meetings. A director who attended all five meetings of the board of directors in 2004 received  20,000 in directors fees, with a fixed portion of  10,000 and a variable portion of  2,000 per meeting. In addition, the members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nomination Committee received compensation, respectively, of  4,000,  2,000 and  4,000 per meeting. The compensation of the chairmen of these committees is double these amounts. Each director must own at least 2,000 shares of the Company throughout his term of office. In 2004, the board of directors of the Company held five meetings and the attendance rate was approximately 85%. The Companys bylaws provide for the retirement age of the directors. Directors cannot be appointed if they are over 70 years old. The term of such director will automatically terminate at the end of the ordinary general meeting of shareholders held in the year during which the director has reached the age of 70. However, according to the Companys bylaws, the general shareholders meeting may resolve that this age limit shall not apply to one or more directors who remain in office or may be re-appointed, provided the number of directors concerned by this provision does not exceed one-quarter of the directors in office. 53 Table of Contents In addition, according to the Companys bylaws, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer (if applicable) and Assistant Managing Directors may not be more than 65 years old. The French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) strictly forbids loans by the Company to its directors. In addition, no company may provide overdrafts for directors or guarantee any directors obligations. This prohibition also applies to specified executive officers, Assistant Managing Directors, permanent representatives of companies on the board of directors, spouses or heirs of such persons, and other intermediaries. The French Commercial Code and the Companys bylaws require any director, the Chief Executive Officer, any Assistant Managing Directors and any of the Companys shareholders having a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10%, or if a shareholder company, the company controlling it, that are considering, either directly or indirectly, personally or through an intermediary, entering into an agreement with the Company, to inform the Companys board of directors as well as its auditors before the transaction is consummated. French law also requires such an agreement to be authorized by the board of directors, and the director in question or person concerned may not vote on the issue. French law further requires such an agreement to be submitted to an ordinary general meeting of shareholders for approval once entered into, upon presentation of a special report from the Companys auditors. Any agreement entered into in violation of these requirements may be declared void by the Commercial Court at the request of the Company or of any shareholder, if such agreement is contrary to the interests of the Company. Moreover, French law also states that agreements which are entered into in the ordinary course of business and with terms and conditions which are not out of the ordinary are not subject to the prior authorization of the board of directors. Nevertheless, such agreements must be disclosed by the interested party to the Chairman of the board of directors unless they are not significant for any party in terms of purpose or financial impact. The list and purpose of such agreements must be communicated by the Chairman of the board to the board of directors and to the statutory auditors. Under French law, directors are liable for violations of French legal or regulatory requirements applicable to sociétés anonymes, violation of the bylaws or mismanagement. A director may be held liable for such actions both individually and jointly with the other directors. 54 Table of Contents Subject to the approval of the shareholders meeting of April 22, 2005 the names and ages of the directors of the Company, their principal occupation or employment, the dates of their initial election as directors and the years of expiration of their terms will be as follows: Name Age Principal Occupation or Employment DirectorSince TermExpires Franck Riboud 49 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Président Directeur Général).

(2) Independent director as determined by the board of directors. (3) Subject to the approval of the shareholders meeting of April 22, 2005. The Companys board also includes three honorary directors who serve in an advisory role: Daniel Carasso (Honorary Chairman), Yves Boël and Jean-Claude Haas. With the resignation of Mr. Umberto Agnelli as director, the appointment of Hirokatsu Hirano by the board of directors on April 15, 2004 will be submitted to the shareholders meeting of April 22, 2005 for ratification, and the renewal of his term of office for a period of three years will be proposed at the shareholders meeting. Mr. Jérôme Seydoux submitted his resignation from the board of directors with effect from the directors meeting held on February 10, 2005. At this meeting, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the board of directors appointed Mr. Jean Laurent as director for the remainder of Mr. Seydouxs term, until the end of the ordinary general meeting called to examine the financial statements for 2005. This appointment will be submitted to the shareholders meeting to be held on April 22, 2005 for ratification. Mr. Laurent is an independent director. In addition, Mr. Jean Gandois informed the board of directors that he will not seek renewal of his term of office. Accordingly, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the candidacy of Mr. Bernard Hours, to replace Mr. Gandois, will be submitted to the shareholders meeting of April 22, 2005. The Company has implemented a charter, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of directors and the principles governing the conduct of its executive officers. These guidelines were adopted at the directors meeting held on April 25, 2002. In 2003, further to the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and following the Bouton Report, a report issued in France to promote better corporate governance practices for listed companies, the board of directors evaluated its operating practices and decided to modify the charter relating to directors of the Company to link the payment of a portion of the directors fees to participation in meetings of the board and its committees, and also to define the operations of the Group that are subject to prior approval of the board. The board of directors applied the recommendations of the Bouton Report to evaluate the independence of the directors according to criteria that are different from those adopted by the New York Stock Exchange. However, the board of directors decided to progressively implement the recommendation of the Bouton Report relating to directors who have served as such for over 12 years and provide for the evolution of the board accordingly. The board of directors also noted that the roles as directors that Mr. Bonnell and Mr. Goblet dAlviella occupy in companies in which Mr. Franck Riboud is also a director did not affect their independence. 56 Table of Contents As a result of these decisions, the board reviewed the position of each of its directors and qualified seven of the thirteen directors as independent. The Company believes that seven of the thirteen directors are also independent under the independence criteria adopted by the New York Stock Exchange. Significant Differences from NYSE Corporate Governance Requirements Although Groupe Danone, as a foreign private issuer, is exempt from most of the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to U.S. companies, Groupe Danone currently complies with substantially all such corporate governance requirements except that Groupe Danones non-management directors do not currently meet without management and Groupe Danones compensation and nomination committees are not composed wholly of independent directors and do not have written charters. Executive Committee Under the authority of Mr. Franck Riboud, the executive officers comprising the executive committee ensure the operational management of the Group. The executive officers implement the Groups strategies as defined by the board of directors, approve the budgets, coordinate the planning and execution of the missions of each of the subsidiaries and business lines and, depending on the results achieved, determine action plans to be implemented. The executive officers meet in committee at least once a month. The following table sets forth the names and ages of the executive officers of the Company and their current positions with the Company: Name Age Position Executive Officer Since Franck Riboud 49 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Président Directeur Général) 1996 Jacques Vincent 59 Vice-Chairman and Directeur Général Délégué 1996 Georges Casala 63 Senior Vice-PresidentBiscuits and Cereal Products 2000 Emmanuel Faber 41 Senior Vice-PresidentFinance, Strategy and Information Systems 2000 Bernard Hours 48 Senior Vice-PresidentFresh Dairy Products 2001 Simon Israël 51 Senior Vice-PresidentAsia/Pacific 1997 Thomas Kunz 47 Senior Vice-PresidentBeverages 2004 Franck Mougin 46 Senior Vice-PresidentHuman Resources 2002 Franck Riboud, 49, has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Président Directeur Général) since 1996.

Directors and Executive Officers Compensation In 2004, the aggregate amount of compensation paid by Danone to its executive officers and directors as a group (18 persons in all) for services in all capacities was  9.3 million, including  9.0 million to executive officers of which  4.3 million was bonus compensation. The aggregate amount paid by Danone for pension, retirement or similar benefits for the same executive officers and directors as a group in respect of the 2004 fiscal year was  0.6 million. Executive officers compensation amounts include a fixed element and a variable element representing between 40% and 60% of total compensation. The variable element is based on economic and individual objectives. For executive officers who manage a business line, the variable element is based on objectives set in the budget in terms of net sales, operating income and free cash flow, to which is added a qualitative evaluation of the strategy developed over the course of the year. For the other executive officers, the variable element is calculated with reference to Group objectives, in terms of net-sales, operating margin, free cash flow and net earnings per share, communicated to the financial markets. The compensation amounts are determined by the board of directors on the basis of recommendations made by the Compensation Committee. 58 Table of Contents In 2003 and 2004, the aggregate amount of compensation for services awarded to the directors was: Compensation and OtherBenefits(1) Name 2003 2004 (in euro) Franck Riboud 2,493,960 2,426,860 Jacques Vincent 1,560,280 1,511,140 Hirokatsu Hirano  15,500 Bruno Bonnell 16,000 14,000 Michel David-Weill 28,000 36,000 Emmanuel Faber 752,800 786,430 Jean Gandois 54,000 82,000 Richard Goblet dAlviella 19,000 48,000 Christian Laubie 36,000 48,000 Hakan Mogren 11,000 14,000 Jacques Nahmias 20,000 20,000 Benoît Potier 11,000 24,000 Jérôme Seydoux 24,000 30,000 (1) Compensation includes gross salary, bonuses, indemnities and directors fees granted by the Company and its subsidiaries for the financial period. In 2004, the variable portion of compensation was  1,435,940 for Franck Riboud,  751,140 for Jacques Vincent and  346,430 for Emmanuel Faber. Employees at Groupe Danone benefit from the Groupe Danone standard employment contracts. However, while Franck Riboud and Jacques Vincent hold their positions as Président Directeur Général and Directeur Général Délégué, respectively, their service contracts with the Company are suspended. In the event that either of these two individuals no longer holds his position, his service contract with the Company will be reinstated, (i) taking into account the length of his terms as Président Directeur Général or Directeur Général Délégué, respectively, for purposes of seniority and benefits, (ii) at a position comparable to that currently held in the executive committee and (iii) at an annual level of compensation no less than the average for all the members of the executive committee during the twelve months prior to such reinstatement. Emmanuel Faber continues to benefit from his service contract without interruption. In addition, if Messrs. Riboud and Vincent are removed from their current positions, they will be entitled to a severance payment of two times the compensation (including bonus compensation and benefits) received during the preceding twelve months. A similar provision also applies to Mr. Faber and all members of the executive committee who hold a service contract under French law. Committees of the Board of Directors The board of directors has established three committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nomination Committee, as described below. The administrative organization of the committees differs from that required of U.S. companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Audit Committee The Audit Committee reviews and comments on the Companys statutory and consolidated financial statements prior to their approval by the board of directors. In addition, the Audit Committee ensures that (i) management has maintained the reliability and integrity of the Companys adopted accounting policies and (ii) management has established internal control procedures that are sufficient to assure quality and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and corporate policies concerning financial reporting. The Committee also reviews internal and external audit activities and results, and performs specific assignments as requested by the board of directors. It approves the fees of the independent accountants. The Audit Committee met seven times in 2004 and in particular examined the impact on the Group of the application of the new international accounting standards (IFRS), the procedures put in place for the valuation of long-term assets and the procedures for risk assessment. Finally, the Audit Committee conducted the selection 59 Table of Contents process for the candidate firms for the Groups independent accountants that were proposed at the shareholders meeting of April 15, 2004. The Audit Committee reviewed the selection criteria, examined the proposed candidates as well as the partner rotation policies, held interviews with representatives from selected firms, and then made a recommendation to the board of directors. The written minutes of the Audit Committee meetings were circulated to the directors and commented on during the meetings of the board of directors. As Mr. Gandois did not seek renewal of his term, Mr. Benoît Potier was named Chairman of the Audit Committee to replace Mr. Gandois. Following the shareholders meeting on April 22, 2005, the members of the Audit Committee will be Benoît Potier (Chairman), Richard Goblet dAlviella and Christian Laubie. Mr. Christian Laubie is the financial expert of the Audit Committee, due to his knowledge of generally accepted accounting principles, procedures of internal control and the roles of the Audit Committee. Mr. Laubie was the Chief Financial Officer for Groupe Danone from 1980 to 2000, and he participates in the organization that regulates statutory audit professionals in France. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee, which makes recommendations to the board of directors with respect to compensation paid and options granted to executive officers, held three meetings in 2004. The Compensation Committee analyzed the compensation packages for the Groups General Managers and compared them with the practices of the Groups peer companies. At December 31, 2004, the members of the Compensation Committee were Mr. Michel David-Weill (Chairman), Mr. Jean Gandois and Mr. Jérôme Seydoux. Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee performs an advisory function for the board of directors. The Nomination Committee met one time in 2004. The Committee examined proposals to the board of directors concerning its function and the nomination of three new directors. At December 31, 2004, the members of the Nomination Committee were Mr. Michel David-Weill (Chairman), Mr. Benoît Potier and Mr. Jérôme Seydoux. Compensation and Nomination Committee The board of directors decided to merge the Compensation Committee and the Nomination Committee, effective April 22, 2005, into a single Compensation and Nomination Committee, which will be composed of Michel David-Weill (Chairman), Jean Laurent and Hakan Mogren. Share Ownership As of December 31, 2004, the total number of shares owned by the Companys directors and executive officers as a group (18 persons) was 319,964 or 0.12% of the outstanding shares, not including 9,816,486 shares held by Eurazeo, in which Mr. Michel David-Weill, a director of the Company, has direct and/or indirect interests. None of the Companys directors or executive officers owns more than 1% of the Companys outstanding shares. 60 Table of Contents Options As of December 31, 2004, a total of 9,454,774 options to purchase existing shares was outstanding, of which 1,866,000 were held by the executive officers, and a total of 61,340 options to subscribe for newly issued shares was outstanding, of which none were held by the executive officers. During 2004, the grants and exercise of options by directors were as follows: Options Granted(1) Options Exercised Board Directors Number ofOptions ExpirationDate ExercisePrice Number ofOptions ExercisePrice Franck Riboud 150,000 04/11/2012  67.41    Jacques Vincent 80,000 04/11/2012  67.41    Emmanuel Faber 50,000 04/11/2012  67.41    (1) Option Plan of April 11, 2003. These options were granted by the board of directors pursuant to employee stock option plans adopted at the general shareholders meetings in May 1995, May 1997, May 1999, May 2001 and April 2003. Pursuant to each option plan, the board was authorized to issue options exercisable in the aggregate for up to 1.0% of the Companys outstanding share capital at the date of issuance (plans adopted in May 1995 and May 1997) or up to four million shares at the date of issuance (plans adopted in May 1999, May 2001 and April 2003), including all options already outstanding under the current and previous plans. Since March 1999, the exercise price for the options should be at least equal to the average price quoted for the shares on Euronext Paris during a period of 20 business days prior to the date of granting by the board. The options may only be exercised two years after their granting, unless an exception is available. In 2004, a total of 258,300 options to purchase existing shares issued under the April 11, 2003 plan were granted at a weighted average exercise price of  67.07 to the 10 employees of the Group, excluding directors (mandataires sociaux), who received the largest number of options, of which 196,000 were granted to five members of the Companys executive committee.

The table below shows the total number of employees at year-end and the percentage of such employees by geographic area and business line from 2002 through 2004. 2002 2003 2004 Total number of employees 92,209 88,607 89,449 By Geographic Area: France 13.3% 13.9% 13.8% Rest of Europe 22.9% 23.1% 23.6% China 24.1% 25.5% 27.2% Rest of Asia-Pacific 21.4% 21.6% 18.7% North and South America 17.8% 15.3% 16.3% Africa 0.5% 0.6% 0.4% Total 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% By Business Line: Fresh dairy products 21.8% 24.0% 26.7% Beverages 43.5% 44.2% 43.7% Biscuits and cereal products 29.7% 27.1% 24.4% Other food businesses 3.6% 3.2% 2.8% Corporate functions 1.4% 1.5% 2.4% Total 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Between 2002 and 2004, permanent employees (those with contracts for indeterminate duration (contrats à durée indéterminée) represented approximately 90% of the average workforce of the Group, the temporary employees representing 10%, equally distributed between part-time employees and those with fixed-term contracts (contrats à durée déterminée). General Policy Danones corporate culture is based on two goals: economic and social. As a result, the Groups human resources policy is founded on two principles: a full and complete involvement in operating decisions and the determination to meet demanding social commitments. In order to ensure the fulfillment of its policy, in 2002 the Group created the Direction du Développement Durable et de la Responsabilité Sociale (Management of Sustainable Development and Social Responsibility). Human resources are organized by division and rely on group-wide structures in key areas such as compensation, organization and know-how, integration of acquisitions, recruitment and senior management. As a result, to attract talent from all over the world, the Group has developed an institutional communication campaign presented on the Internet by the website danonepeople.com. The development of human resources is ensured by training and quality management, for example, through tools such as 360° personal assessments and coaching. Furthermore, human resources promotes the Groups international development through (i) a global recruitment policy, (ii) encouraging the movement of managers around the world through a dedicated team that manages the administrative, financial and personal aspects of transfers and rotations and (iii) the integration of newly acquired companies. 63 Table of Contents Social Policy Group Danones Fundamental Principles. The Groups core principles are based on International Labor Organization conventions relating to the prohibition of child labor, forced labor, discriminatory practices, safety and working conditions, working hours, freedom of association and expression of employees and the right to collective bargaining. These principles are minimum requirements to be met by all Group companies, related companies, partners and suppliers. The implementation of a human resource and social policy is only valid insofar as the basic requirements are fulfilled by the employees of the Group and its partners. These requirements relate to safety and working conditions, welfare and wages. Safety and Working Conditions. Group policies regarding safety and working conditions apply to all employees, including temporary staff, interns and apprentices, who are all included in statistics, and to all Group companies, whether recently acquired or not. Welfare. The Group has developed a welfare policy in accordance with the economic situation of the environment in which the subsidiaries operate. Welfare takes into account the fundamental needs for social protection of employees and their families. It covers areas as diverse as death benefits insurance, pensions, workplace accidents, access to medical care and insurance for business travel. Wages. The Groups objective is to be attractive in the countries in which it is present. Wages are a key factor in the Groups human resource policies which offer the continued acquisition of skills and career possibilities. The Groups objective is to better attract and motivate employees, and the Group seeks to be competitive with leading international companies in each country where it operates. In 2001, the Group introduced a worldwide classification system for all managers, enabling them to identify their precise ranking and related responsibilities. In 2004, the Groups personnel expenses, including social expenses, amounted to  1,729 million compared with  1,853 million in 2003 and  1,930 million in 2002. In addition,  115 million was paid to the employees of the Group in 2004 as part of the incentive and profit sharing schemes, compared with  118 million in 2003 and  117 million in 2002. Working Hours. Agreements for the reduction of the number of working hours were entered into during or prior to 1999 in the French subsidiaries of the Group where, for the workers or employees, the weekly number of working hours was between 32.5 and 35 hours. The number of hours is calculated on a yearly basis of less than 1,600 hours and the working hours are adjusted according to the needs of the business. For managerial staff, the reduction implemented by the granting of additional rest days resulted in a number of work days per year of approximately 209 to 212. The counter side to the negotiations of these agreements was the freezing of wages, and limited increases for two years, an improvement resulting in greater productivity and reactivity. Dialogue with Unions. Most of the non-managerial staff of the Group in Western Europe are represented by the principal national workers unions. In general, each subsidiary negotiates and establishes yearly company agreements with the relevant unions. In 1996, the Group created its Information and Consultation Committee, which meets once a year and is composed of Group union members and permanent national unions on the one hand and Danone human resources and operational managers on the other. It also has four observer members from the International Union of Food Workers (IUF). Regular dialogue has existed since 1985 with the IUF, which has led to the implementation of six common programs since 1988 relating to equal opportunities in the workplace, the availability of economic and social information, the recognition of union rights and informing representatives of the personnel in the event of a modification of the business which may affect jobs and working conditions and the restructuring of the biscuits segment. Training. More than ten years ago, the Company put in place a series of training programs in areas such as purchasing, marketing, human resources and financing that are run by professionals from various companies within the Group with the assistance of outside specialists, in the form of educational partnerships with universities. 64 Table of Contents Leading Social and Environmental Responsibility. In conducting business, the Danone Way is both a business conduct policy and a tool designed to assist the Groups subsidiaries in addressing a number of ethical areas, such as employment policy, environmental and food safety issues. These guidelines reflect the perspectives and particular concerns of key categories of stakeholders such as employees, consumers and clients, suppliers, stockholders, the community in general and the environment. Through Internet technology, all of the Groups subsidiaries have access to this resource. The Danone Way allows the Group to meet the expectations of stakeholders and its move towards social progress. For example, in the context of its social policies, the Danone Way is inspired by the texts from the International Labor Organization, which are viewed as basic benchmarks in all the countries where the Group operates. Evaluation of management and of the Groups human resource policy is based on about 30 criteria set out in several themes: compliance with the law, respect for individuals, progress for organizations and employees, implementing values, and open communication with employees and their representatives. For each stakeholder, each of the subsidiaries teams performs self-evaluations on the basis of a set of practices as defined by the Group and takes steps to improve. The Danone Way is an opportunity for the management teams of each of the subsidiaries to spread the Groups culture to its managers and to lead discussions on its practices. Working groups bringing together individuals from different backgrounds are asked to contribute to the evaluation process. At the end of the process, the results are approved and endorsed by executives of each subsidiary who are responsible for developing plans of action if necessary. The Danone Way has enabled each subsidiary to identify strong and weak points in different areas. It has also allowed them to prioritize and implement plans for improvement. This method should also enable the Group to establish a more precise reporting system in areas where quantification is not always possible or sufficient. The Danone Way was first introduced in 2000, tested in 2001 in approximately 10 subsidiaries and more fully deployed during 2002 and 2003. As of today, more than 90% of the Groups subsidiaries have implemented or are currently implementing the Danone Way and independent audits have been carried out in 21 subsidiaries by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Mazars to validate their self-evaluations. After having revised the content of the questionnaire to make it simpler and more pedagogic, the results of the audits show that there are no significant weaknesses in the processes and the self-evaluations. The results of the self-evaluations show strong practices in areas involving employees, shareholders, customers and suppliers. The results in areas involving the environment in general and civil society are weaker because they are less directly linked to the core of the Groups businesses and correspond to less established practices in certain countries in which the Group operates. Furthermore, in addition to the self-evaluation procedures, the board of directors decided in 2003 to undergo an evaluation by the rating agency Vigeo at the parent level. Vigeo auditors conducted approximately 50 internal interviews and approximately 20 external interviews to evaluate six areas of social and environmental responsibility using 40 criteria. Overall, Vigeo placed Danone at level 3 or 4, which correspond, respectively, to the following evaluations: the company fully assumes its obligations, carries out recommendations and controls risks (level 3) and the company is not only active, but anticipates risks and contributes with others to the promotion of social and environmental responsibility at the industry-wide, national, regional and/or global level (level 4). Measures Accompanying Restructuring. In connection with the restructuring of certain of its operations, some of Danones subsidiaries have undergone headcount reductions through early retirements, voluntary departures and lay-offs. To assist the employees concerned, Danone has created special programs providing employees with assistance and alternative employment opportunities in affected regions. Danones policy is to never leave an employee in a situation in which he or she must handle an employment problem without support. To this effect, Danone relies on two initiatives:  First, Danone relies on providing in-house solutions, accompanied by various relocation assistance measures, including for example relocation allowances, indemnification in the event of salary loss, 65 Table of Contents organization of one or more reconnaissance trips for the employee and its family to the new location, and, for spouses, compensation of possible income loss, assistance in search for employment and financing of training.  Second, the Group relies on implementing external solutions for employees who cannot relocate or, in the event of a shortage of in-house opportunities, by assisting employees who aspire to create their own businesses by means of technical assistance, and assisting in the search for alternative employment in other local businesses through the creation of employment centers. These centers are headed by the Companys human resources personnel and other employment counselors. Their objective is to assist individuals concerned until their situation has been resolved by arranging jobs interviews, career evaluations and training, and by identifying opportunities available in a given area. In order to compensate for the loss of economic activity and decrease in tax revenues for the regions affected, the Group undertakes various actions aimed at creating long-term sources of employment in the relevant region. The Group has dedicated specific funds for that purpose. In addition, Danone strives to reinforce the economic backbone of the labor markets affected through close collaboration with local authorities, assistance in the canvassing and setting up of new businesses, technical support to local small- and medium-sized businesses that may be able to hire the relocated employees (monetary contribution, counseling by executives of the Group and staff trainings) and the financing of local infrastructures and initiatives. In order to remedy the excess capacity in Europe, the Group began a reorganization of its biscuit activities in 2001. In the course of this reorganization, the following solutions were proposed to employees of the Group: an offer of employment at one of the Groups other sites, two offers of employment from companies in the same region, with a guarantee that their salary will remain the same for a year, taking advantage of measures benefiting employees over the age of 55 and assisting employees who aspire to create their own businesses by means of technical and financial assistance. At the end of 2004, of the 2,025 employees affected by the reorganization of the biscuit activities in France and Europe, approximately 94% had found solutions within or outside the Group. The Group concluded reindustrialization agreements for each of the six closed sites, and more than 3,500 European enterprises have been contacted to establish businesses on these sites. Already three projects have been realized, creating more than 500 jobs. At the other sites, solutions are in the process of being finalized. Corporate citizenship. Involvement in the community is both a necessity and a founding principle of the Groups corporate culture. Generally speaking, the Group is involved in offering support for public bodies, NGOs and local non-profit associations chosen for their commitment. Local economic impact on emerging economies. Over the past decade, the Company has set up operations in many emerging countries, with local production to meet domestic demand. Publications. Danone has been publishing a Social Responsibility Report since 1998, which presents the social and environmental impacts of the Groups activities. This report is available at Groupe Danone, 17, Boulevard Haussmann, 75009 Paris. 66 Table of Contents Item 7.

Stock option and stock purchase plans Stock option and stock purchase plans have been granted to the Companys senior management, usually on a bi-annual basis. The duration of these plans was extended to eight years in 1997. The exercise price for the options must amount to at least the average price for the 20 trading days preceding the board of directors meeting which grants the options and generally may not be exercised for two years after the grant date. The general meeting of shareholders, by successive authorizations, authorized the board of directors to grant, once or multiple times, over a maximum period of 26 months, options to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company subject to a limit of 1% of the Companys share capital for the May 1995 and 1997 plans and a limit of four million shares for the May 1999, May 2001 and April 2003 plans (after taking into account the two-for-one stock split on June 15, 2004).

These options are exercisable in thirds, beginning, respectively, on January 1, 2003, January 1, 2005 and July 1, 2006, at a price to be determined based on an agreed upon formula, taking into account the then current market value of the shares. At the end of 2002, Danone confirmed its intention to exercise its purchase option, and an independent expert was charged with completing an evaluation of Danone Asia Pte Ltd. The interest of the Group in this company increased from 90.34% at December 31, 2002 to 93.56% at December 31, 2003, and further increased to 96.78% in January 2005.

Financial Information Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information See Item 18. Financial Statements, for a list of the financial statements filed with this annual report. Dividend Policy The declaration and amount of dividends to be paid on the shares in respect of any period are subject to the decision by the Companys shareholders at an ordinary general meeting of shareholders. Pursuant to French law, payment of dividends must be made within nine months following the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. Under French law and the Companys bylaws, the Companys unconsolidated statutory net income in each fiscal year, as increased or reduced, as the case may be, by any profit or loss of the Company carried forward from prior years, less any contributions to legal reserves, is available for distribution to the shareholders of the Company as dividends, subject to other applicable requirements of French law and the Companys bylaws. Pursuant to the Companys bylaws, the Companys shareholders may determine at an ordinary meeting the portion, if any, of dividends that each shareholder may elect to receive in shares. For dividends distributed in respect of the years 1989 through 1995, each of the Companys shareholders was given the option of receiving dividends in the form of cash or shares. Applications for dividend payments in the form of shares shall be submitted no later than three months after the date on which the general shareholders meeting is held. The board of directors does not intend to recommend a stock dividend in the near future. Dividends paid to holders of shares or ADSs who are not residents of France generally will be subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 25%. Under certain tax treaties entered into between France and other countries, such withholding tax may be reduced to 15% for holders of shares who qualify for the benefits of these treaties, subject to certain procedures and exceptions. Under the Treaty between France and the United States for Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and Capital signed on August 31, 1994 (the Treaty), such reduced withholding tax may apply to holders of shares and also to holders of ADSs, who are residents of the United States as defined by the provisions of the Treaty, subject to certain procedures and exceptions. French residents were entitled to a tax credit known as the avoir fiscal with respect to dividends paid to them in 2004, the amount of which depended on the recipient of the dividends. Under certain tax treaties entered into between France and other countries, such avoir fiscal may, in certain circumstances, be paid, net of withholding tax, to non-French resident holders of shares. In addition, under the Treaty, such payment of avoir fiscal, net of withholding tax, may have been available not only to certain holders of shares but also to certain holders of ADSs, qualifying as U.S. residents under the Treaty, subject to certain exceptions and procedures. Avoir fiscal is no longer available on dividends distributed by French companies as from January 2005. See Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationFrench TaxationTaxation of Dividends and Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationTaxation of U.S. InvestorsTaxation of Dividends. Dividends paid to holders of ADSs are converted from euro to dollars and subjected to a charge by the depositary for any expenses incurred by the depositary in such conversion. 70 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the total dividends paid per share and per ADS for each year indicated, with and without the French avoir fiscal and before deduction of any French withholding tax, taking into account the two-for-one stock split effected by the Company in June 2000 and June 2004.

(2) Any payment equivalent to the French avoir fiscal or tax credit, less applicable French withholding tax, will be made only following receipt by the French Tax Administration of a claim for such payment filed by shareholders entitled to such payment, and is generally not expected to be paid before 12 months after the filing of such claim, and after the close of the calendar year in which the respective dividends are paid. Avoir fiscal is no longer available on dividends distributed by French companies as from January 2005. See Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationFrench Taxation and Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationTaxation of U.S. Investors. (3) Periods prior to 2004 translated solely for convenience from French francs or euro into dollars at the Noon Buying Rates on the respective dividend payment dates, or on the following business day if such date was not a business day in France or the United States. For convenience only, avoir fiscal amounts have been translated into dollars at the Noon Buying Rates on such dates although such amounts are paid subsequent to such payment dates. The Noon Buying Rates may differ from the rate that may be used by the Depositary to convert euro to dollars for purposes of making payments to holders of ADSs. Figures for 2004 translated solely for convenience at the Noon Buying Rate on December 31, 2004 of $ 1.3538 per  1.00. (4) As each ADS represents one-fifth of one share, the amount of dividends per share has been divided by five to obtain the historical dividends declared per ADS. (5) Dividends to be proposed at the shareholders meeting to be held on April 22, 2005. Legal Proceedings On December 5, 2001, the European Commission concluded that anti-competitive practices in the beer market in Belgium had occurred and imposed a fine of  44.6 million on Group Danone. The entire amount was provisioned in the Groups accounts at December 31, 2001 and was paid in 2002. In February 2002, the Group launched a procedure seeking to recover the amount paid, the outcome of which is still pending. In September 2004, the European Commission rendered its decision following an investigation of alleged understandings among beer market participants in France and imposed a fine of  1.5 million on Groupe Danone. The Group is not presently party to litigation or arbitration that could have or has had, in the recent past, a significant effect on it financial condition, activities or results. The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including in connection with certain warranties given as part of the divestitures completed between 1997 and 2004. In some cases, damages are sought and liabilities are accrued for when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. 71 Table of Contents Item 9.

Plan of Distribution Not applicable. Nature of Trading Market General On September 22, 2000, upon successful completion of an exchange offer, the Paris Bourse SBF SA, or the SBF, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Brussels Stock Exchange merged to create Euronext, the first pan-European exchange. Through the exchange offer, all the shareholders of the SBF, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Brussels Stock Exchange contributed their shares to Euronext N.V., a Dutch holding company. Following the creation of Euronext, the SBF changed its name to Euronext Paris. Euronext N.V. has been listed on Eurolist by Euronext (formerly the Premier Marché) of Euronext Paris since July 2001. In January 2002, Euronext N.V acquired the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE), Londons derivatives market. The combination of LIFFE and Euronext N.V. will, among other things, triple the volume of derivatives business conducted through the LIFFE CONNECT trading platform. Since February 6, 2002, Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto (BVLP) has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Euronext N.V. and has therefore been renamed Euronext Lisbon. Securities quoted on exchanges participating in Euronext cash markets are traded and cleared over common Euronext platforms; NSC is the common platform for trading, Clearing 21 for clearing, and LIFFE CONNECT, the LIFFE trading platform, is already used for all Euronext and futures options. In addition, Euronext Paris anticipates the implementation of central clearinghouse, settlement and custody structures over a common system. However, these securities will remain listed on their local exchanges. As part of Euronext, Euronext Paris retains responsibility for the admission of shares to Euronext Paris trading markets as well as the regulation of those markets. Euronext Paris As from February 21, 2005, all securities currently traded on the Premier, Second and Nouveau Marchés are listed and traded on a single market, Eurolist by Euronext, which is operated by Euronext Paris. In accordance with Euronext Paris rules, the shares issued by domestic and other companies are classified in capitalization compartments. The shares of listed companies are distributed between three capitalization compartments, according to the criteria set by Euronext Paris:  Compartment A comprises the companies with market capitalizations above  1 billion;  Compartment B comprises the companies with market capitalizations from  150 million and up to and including  1 billion;  Compartment C comprises the companies with capitalizations below  150 million. The Companys shares have been classified in Compartment A of the Eurolist by Euronext market. In addition, securities of certain other companies are traded on a non-regulated over-the-counter market, the Marché Libre OTC, which is also operated by Euronext Paris. Securities listed on Euronext Paris are placed in one of two categories (Continu or Fixing) depending on the volume of transactions. The Companys shares are listed in the category known as Continu, which includes the most actively traded securities. The minimum yearly trading volume required for a security to be placed in Continu is 2,500 trades. Securities listed on Eurolist by Euronext are traded through authorized financial institutions that are members of Euronext Paris. Trading on Eurolist by Euronext takes place continuously on each business day 73 Table of Contents from 9:00 a.m. to 5:25 p.m. (Paris time), with a pre-opening session from 7:15 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and a pre-closing session from 5:25 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. during which transactions are recorded but not executed, a closing auction at 5:30 p.m. and a trading at last phase from 5:30 p.m. to 5:40 p.m. Any trade of securities effected after the close of a stock exchange session is recorded on the next Euronext Paris trading day at the previous sessions closing price for the relevant security. Euronext Paris publishes a daily official price list that includes price information concerning listed securities. Euronext Paris has introduced continuous electronic trading during trading hours for most actively traded securities. Trading in the listed securities of an issuer may be suspended by Euronext Paris if quoted prices exceed certain price limits defined by the regulations of Euronext Paris. In particular, if the quoted price of a Continu security, such as the Companys shares, varies by more than 10% from the previous days closing price or once trading has begun, Euronext may suspend trading for up to four minutes. Once trading has commenced, further suspensions for up to four minutes are also possible if the price again varies by more than 10% from a new reference price equal to the price which caused the first trading suspension. Euronext Paris may also suspend trading for a four-minute period if trades are bound to breach the so-called dynamic thresholds, set at 2% plus or minus the last trade price. Euronext Paris may also suspend trading of a listed security in certain other circumstances, including, for example, the occurrence of unusual trading activity in such security. In addition, in exceptional cases, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (the AMF) may also suspend trading. All trades of securities listed on Eurolist by Euronext are performed on a cash-settlement basis on the third trading day after the trade. However, market intermediaries are also permitted to offer investors a deferred settlement service (Service à Règlement Différé or SRD) for a fee. The SRD allows investors who elect this service to benefit from leverage and other special features of the monthly settlement market. The SRD is reserved for securities which have a total market capitalization of at least  1 billion and represent a minimum daily trading volume of  1 million and which are normally cited on a list published by Euronext Paris. The Companys shares are eligible for the deferred settlement service. Investors can elect on the determination date (date de liquidation), which is, at the latest, the fifth trading day before the end of the month, either to settle the trade by the last trading day of the month or to pay an additional fee and postpone the settlement decision to the determination date of the following month. Prior to any transfer of securities held in registered form on Eurolist by Euronext, the securities must be converted into bearer form and accordingly inscribed in an account maintained by an accredited intermediary with Euroclear France S.A., a registered clearing agency. Securities transactions are initiated by the owner giving instructions (through an agent, if appropriate) to the relevant accredited intermediary. Trading securities listed on Eurolist by Euronext are cleared and settled through Clearing 21 and Euroclear France S.A. using a continuous net settlement system. A fee or a commission is payable to the broker-dealer or other agent involved in the transaction. Ownership of equities traded on a deferred settlement basis is considered to have been transferred only after the equities have been registered in the purchasers account. Under French securities regulations, any sale of securities executed on a deferred settlement basis during the month a dividend is deemed to occur after the dividend has been paid. If the sale takes place before, but during the month of, a dividend payment date, the purchasers account will be credited with an amount equal to the dividend paid, and the sellers accounts will be debited by the same amount.
