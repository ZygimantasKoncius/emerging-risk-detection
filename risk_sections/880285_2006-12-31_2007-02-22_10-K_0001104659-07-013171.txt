Item 1A. Risk Factors We encourage you to read the risk factors below in connection with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Our financial performance could be adversely affected if our pipeline systems are used less. Our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes transported on our pipeline systems. Decreases in the volumes transported by our systems, whether caused by supply or demand factors in the markets these systems serve, competition or otherwise, can directly and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The volume of shipments on our Lakehead system depends heavily on the supplies of western Canadian crude oil. Insufficient supplies of western Canadian crude oil will adversely affect our business by limiting shipments on our Lakehead system. Decreases in conventional crude oil exploration and production activities in western Canada and other factors including supply disruption and competition can reduce the utilization of our Lakehead system. For example, in January 2005, deliveries on our Lakehead system were impacted by a fire at a Suncor facility. The volume of crude oil that we transport on the Lakehead system also depends on the demand for crude oil in the Great Lakes and Midwest regions of the United States and the delivery by others of crude oil and refined products into these regions and the Province of Ontario. Pipeline capacity for the delivery of crude oil to the Great Lakes and Midwest regions of the United States currently exceeds refining capacity. In addition, our ability to increase deliveries to expand the Lakehead system in the future depends on increased supplies of western Canadian crude oil. We expect that growth in future supplies of western Canadian crude oil will come from oil sands projects in Alberta, Canada. Furthermore, full utilization of additional capacity as a result of our current and future expansions of the Lakehead system, including the 37 Terrace expansion program, will largely depend on these anticipated increases in crude oil production from oil sands projects. The volume of shipments on natural gas systems depends on the supply of natural gas and NGLs available for shipment on those systems from the producing regions that supply these systems. Volumes shipped on these systems also are affected by the demand for natural gas and NGLs in the markets these systems serve. Existing customers may not extend their contracts if the availability of natural gas from the Mid-continent, Gulf Coast and East Texas producing regions was to decline or if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the markets served by the natural gas systems was to render the delivered cost of natural gas on our systems uneconomical. We may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees. Changes in our tariff rates or challenges to our tariff rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; a recent FERC Policy Statement that limited allowances for income tax in an unrelated pipelines cost of service, if applied to our FERC-regulated systems, could adversely affect our rates. The tariff rates charged by several of our existing pipeline systems are regulated by the FERC, or various state regulatory agencies. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower our tariff rates, the profitability of our pipeline businesses might suffer. If we were permitted to raise our tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which delay could further reduce our cash flow. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent us from raising our tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit us to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate our systems periodically propose and implement new rules and regulations, terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the tariff rates charged for our services. Some producing states, including Oklahoma and Texas, are considering legislation that would require rate and/or service regulation of gathering and intrastate transmission natural gas systems. Increased state regulation could adversely impact our natural gas systems. The question of whether and to what extent an income tax allowance should be included in a regulated utilitys cost of service for rate-making purposes was a matter of uncertainty for a number of years. In a 1995 decision involving our Lakehead system, which we refer to as the Lakehead ruling, the FERC partially disallowed the inclusion of income taxes in the cost of service for the Lakehead system. A subsequent appeal of the Lakehead ruling was resolved by settlement and therefore was not adjudicated. In another FERC proceeding involving SFPP, the FERC initially relied on its previous Lakehead ruling to hold that SFPP could not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non-corporate partners, both individuals and other entities. SFPP and other parties to the proceeding appealed the FERCs orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On July 20, 2004, in BP West Coast Products LLC v. FERC, which we refer to as the BP West Coast decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision upholding certain aspects of the FERCs orders regarding the SFPP case, but vacating the FERCs ruling regarding the proper tax allowance for SFPP. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the FERCs rationale for its Lakehead ruling and remanded the case to the FERC for further proceedings. In the wake of the BP West Coast decision, the FERC initiated a notice and comment process to address tax allowance issues across a range of industries. We and many other companies commented on the proceeding. On May 4, 2005, the FERC issued a policy statement on income tax allowances, in which it reinstated its earlier policy of providing a full tax allowance on all partnership and similar legal interests in regulated companies if the owner of that interest has an actual or potential tax liability on the income earned through that interest. Whether a pipelines owners have such actual or potential income tax liability 38 will be reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. On December 16, 2005, FERC issued its first case-specific oil pipeline review of the income tax allowance issue in the SFPP proceeding, reaffirming its new income tax allowance policy and directing SFPP to provide certain evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance. The new tax allowance policy and the December 16 order have been appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, and rehearing requests have been filed with respect to the December 16 order. As well as the SFPP decision, which is currently on appeal, there are two other cases with respect to tax allowance pending in the D.C. Circuit Court including Exxon Mobil Oil Corporation v. FERC and CAPP v. FERC. The D.C. Circuit Court heard oral arguments on these cases on December 12, 2006. A decision is expected by April 2007. At this time, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not certain and could result in changes to the FERCs treatment of income tax allowances in cost of service. Whether the income tax allowance policy is ultimately upheld or modified on judicial review, could affect the tariffs of FERC-regulated pipelines. A related issue is whether the FERCs income tax allowance policy can be relied upon by shippers as a substantial change in circumstances sufficient to remove the grandfathering protection under the EP Act from an oil pipelines rates. The FERC determined in the SFPP case that its policy statement on income tax allowances does not represent a change from its pre-EP Act policy and therefore, cannot affect grandfathering of rates, a position that is still potentially subject to further judicial review. At this time, the effect of the FERCs policy statement on income tax allowances on us is uncertain. The tariff rates on our common carrier interstate liquids pipelines have been established under a variety of different circumstances including settlements and tariff indexing. It is anticipated that a change in the income tax allowance policy would only impact those rates that were established after indexing. Even with the indexed rates, the income tax allowance is only one of many elements supporting our pipeline rates for service. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future, or the potential impact on us of a change in the FERCs policy statement on income tax allowances. We believe that the rates we charge for transportation services on our interstate common carrier liquids pipelines are just and reasonable under the ICA. However, because the rates that we charge are subject to review upon an appropriately supported protest or complaint, we cannot predict what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for service on our interstate common carrier liquids pipelines. Furthermore, because rates charged for transportation services must be competitive with those charged by other transporters, the rates set forth in our tariffs will be determined based on competitive factors in addition to regulatory considerations. Competition may reduce our revenues. Our Lakehead system faces current, and potentially further competition for transporting western Canadian crude oil from other pipelines, which may reduce our revenues. Our Lakehead system competes with other crude oil and refined product pipelines and other methods of delivering crude oil and refined products to the refining centers of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; Buffalo, New York; and Sarnia, Ontario and the refinery market and pipeline hub located in the Patoka/Wood River area of southern Illinois. Refineries in the markets served by our Lakehead system compete with refineries in western Canada, the Province of Ontario and the Rocky Mountain region of the United States for supplies of western Canadian crude oil. Our Ozark pipeline system could face a significant increase in competition if a proposed new pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta to Patoka is completed in 2009. However, if that situation occurs, we would consider potential alternative uses for our Ozark system. We also encounter competition in our natural gas gathering, treating, processing and transmission businesses. A number of new interstate natural gas transmission pipelines being constructed could reduce 39 the revenue we derive from the interstate and intrastate transmission of natural gas. Many of the large wholesale customers served by our systems transmission and wholesale customer pipelines have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities. Thus, many of these wholesale customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines and/or from third parties that may hold capacity on other pipelines. Likewise, most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering and processing facilities available to them. In addition, they have other alternatives, such as building their own gathering facilities or, in some cases, selling their natural gas supplies without processing. Some of our natural gas marketing competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger supplies of natural gas than those available to us, which could allow those competitors to price their services more aggressively than we do. Our gas marketing operations involve market and certain regulatory risks. As part of our natural gas marketing activities, we purchase natural gas at prices determined by prevailing market conditions. Following our purchase of natural gas, we generally resell natural gas at a higher price under a sales contract that is generally comparable in terms to our purchase contract, including any price escalation provisions. The profitability of our natural gas operations may be affected by the following factors: · our ability to negotiate on a timely basis natural gas purchase and sales agreements in changing markets; · reluctance of wholesale customers to enter into long-term purchase contracts; · consumers willingness to use other fuels when natural gas prices increase significantly; · timing of imbalance or volume discrepancy corrections and their impact on financial results; · the ability of our customers to make timely payment; · inability to match purchase and sale of natural gas on comparable terms; and · changes in, limitations upon, or elimination of the regulatory authorization required for our wholesale sales of natural gas in interstate commerce. Our results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities. We buy and sell natural gas and NGLs in connection with our marketing activities. Commodity price exposure is also inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges. Further, hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts. In addition certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. This causes periodic earnings volatility due to turbulent commodity prices. Compliance with environmental and operational safety regulations, including any remediation of soil or water pollution or hydrostatic testing of our pipeline systems, may increase our costs and/or reduce our revenues. Our pipeline, gathering, processing and trucking operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational and worker safety. Liquid petroleum and natural gas transportation and processing operations always involve the risk of costs or liabilities or operational modifications related to regulatory compliance as well as resulting from historical environmental contamination, accidental releases or upsets, regulatory enforcement, litigation or safety and health incidents. As a result, we may incur costs or liabilities of this type, or experience a reduction in 40 revenues, in the future. We may also incur costs in the future due to changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations, enforcement policies or claims for personal, property or environmental damage. We may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or through higher tariffs. Failure of pipeline operations due to unforeseen interruptions or catastrophic events may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Operation of complex pipeline systems, gathering, treating, processing and trucking operations involves many risks, hazards and uncertainties, such as operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions caused by events beyond our control. These events include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides or other similar events beyond our control. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life or extensive property or environmental damage for which we may bear a part or all of the cost. Our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we incorrectly predict operating results, are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses or are unable to raise financing on acceptable terms. The acquisition of complementary energy delivery assets is a component of our strategy. Acquisitions present various risks and challenges, including: · the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of the acquired operations or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring such operations; · the risk of failing to effectively integrate the operations or management of acquired assets or businesses or a significant delay in such integration; and · diversion of managements attention from existing operations. In addition, we may be unable to identify acquisition targets and consummate acquisitions in the future or be unable to raise, on terms we find acceptable, any debt or equity financing that may be required for any such acquisition. Our actual construction and development costs could exceed our forecast and our cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate which may limit our ability to increase cash distributions. Our strategy contemplates significant expenditures for the development, construction or other acquisitions of energy infrastructure assets. Increased demand for the steel used to fabricate the pipe needed for our construction projects and increased competition for labor has resulted in increased costs for these resources. As a result, we may not be able to complete our projects at the costs currently estimated or within the time periods we have projected. If we experience material cost overruns, we will have to finance these overruns using one or more of the following methods: · using cash from operations; · delaying other planned projects; · incurring additional indebtedness; or · issuing additional equity. Any or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results operations and cash flows. Our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on our expenditure of funds on a particular project. For example, if we build a new pipeline or expand an existing facility, the design, construction, development and installation may occur over an extended period of time and we may not 41 receive any material increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the systems. If our revenues and cash flow do not increase at projected levels because of substantial unanticipated delays, or other factors, we may not meet our obligations as they become due and we may need to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget, sell non-strategic assets, access the capital markets or reassess our level of distributions to unitholders to meet our capital requirements. Measurement losses on our pipeline system can be materially impacted by changes in estimation, commodity prices and other factors. Oil measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines. The three types of oil measurement losses include: · physical losses, which occur through evaporation, shrinkage, differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents; · degradation losses, which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines; and · revaluation losses, which are a function of crude oil prices and the level of the carriers inventory. Quantifying oil measurement losses is inherently difficult because physical measurements of volumes are not practical due to the fact that products constantly move through our pipelines and virtually all of our pipeline systems are located underground. In our case, measuring and quantifying oil measurement losses is especially difficult because of the size and scope of our pipeline systems and the number of different grades of crude oil and types of crude oil products we carry. Accordingly, we utilize engineering-based models and operational assumptions to estimate product volumes in our system and associated oil measurement losses. Natural gas measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines. The quantification and resolution of measurement losses is complicated by several factors including: 1) the significant quantities (i.e., thousands) of measurement meters that we use throughout our natural gas systems, primarily around our gathering and processing assets; 2) varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems; and 3) variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies. Each of these factors may contribute to measurement losses that can occur on our natural gas systems. The interests of Enbridge may differ from our interests and the interests of our security holders, and the board of directors of Enbridge Management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict, not just the interests of our security holders, in making important business decisions. Enbridge indirectly owns all of the stock of our general partner and all of the voting stock of Enbridge Management, and elects all of the directors of both companies. Furthermore, some of the directors and officers of our general partners and Enbridge Management are also directors and officers of Enbridge. Consequently, conflicts of interest could arise between our unitholders and Enbridge. Our partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders. These restrictions allow our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest by considering the interests of all of the parties to the conflict, including Enbridge Managements interests, our interests and those of our general partner. In addition, these limitations reduce the rights of our unitholders under our partnership agreement to sue our general partner or Enbridge Management, its delegee, should its directors or officers act in a way that, were it not for these limitations of liability, would constitute breaches of their fiduciary duties. 42 We do not have any employees. In managing our business and affairs, we will rely on employees of Enbridge, and its affiliates, who will act on behalf of and as agents for us. A decrease in the availability of employees from Enbridge could adversely affect us. We are exposed to credit risks of our customers For example our Bamagas system has agreements to provide transportation of up to 276,000 MMBtu/d of natural gas for a remaining period of 17 years to two utility plants that are indirectly owned by Calpine Corporation (Calpine). The Bamagas system receives a fixed demand charge of $0.07 per MMBtu of natural gas for 200,000 MMBtu/d, regardless of whether the capacity is used. In December 2005, Calpine and many of its subsidiaries, including the subsidiary that owns the two utility plants served by our Bamagas system, filed voluntarily petitions to restructure under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, Calpine has announced receipt of commitments for up to $2 billion of Debtor in Possession, or DIP financing to allow for the continued operation of its power plants. Our Bamagas system is the sole supplier of natural gas to these two utility plants, and we expect the subsidiary that owns these utility plants to continue performing under the terms of our agreement. Although we fully expect our customer to continue to meet its obligations to us under the terms of the transportation agreements, we are exposed to a potential asset impairment of up to $53 million, representing the book value of the pipeline, if the customer is unable to fulfill its commitments. In April 2006, Calpine announced its intent to sell approximately 20 of its non-core and non-strategic power plants, although the plants to be sold have not been announced. Calpine has continued to perform under the terms of its agreement with Bamagas and we remain confident that any losses we may incur with respect to Calpines bankruptcy will be minimal. We continue to monitor the Calpine bankruptcy proceedings and will recognize any losses that may result when it becomes evident that a loss has been incurred. Canadas ratification of the Kyoto Protocol may adversely impact our operations. In December 2002, Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels. We and Enbridge are monitoring the Canadian federal governments approach to implementation. While the United States is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, other environmental protection initiatives have been implemented regulating certain priority pollutants. Revisions have been proposed to the U.S. Energy Act that would, if passed, expand the regulation of certain greenhouse gas emissions requiring a cap and establishing a trade to facilitate compliance. Such provisions would make natural gas pipelines the segment of the gas industry regulated by an amendment. While proposed legislation has not yet passed and as other legislation is being proposed the outcome is uncertain at this time. If and when these provisions pass the Partnership could be subject to additional costs to monitor and control emissions above and beyond current practices and permits. 43 RISKS ARISING FROM OUR PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR GENERAL PARTNER AND ENBRIDGE MANAGEMENT Our partnership agreement and the delegation of control agreement limit the fiduciary duties that Enbridge Management and our general partner owe to our unitholders and restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by Enbridge Management and our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our general partner would otherwise owe to our unitholders under state fiduciary duty law. Through the delegation of control agreement, these modified fiduciary duties also apply to Enbridge Management as the delegate of our general partner. For example, our partnership agreement: · permits our general partner to make a number of decisions, including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest, in its sole discretion. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any unitholder; · provides that any standard of care and duty imposed on our general partner will be modified, waived or limited as required to permit our general partner to act under our partnership agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in our partnership agreement, so long as such action is reasonably believed by the general partner to be in our best interests; and · provides that our general partner and its directors and officers will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our unitholders for any acts or omissions if they acted in good faith. These and similar provisions in our partnership agreement may restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by Enbridge Management or our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty. Potential conflicts of interest may arise among Enbridge and its shareholders, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders and Enbridge Management and its shareholders, on the other hand. Because the fiduciary duties of the directors of our general partner and Enbridge Management have been modified, the directors may be permitted to make decisions that benefit Enbridge and its shareholders or Enbridge Management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among Enbridge and its shareholders, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders and Enbridge Management and its shareholders, on the other hand. Conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our unitholders, on the one hand, and Enbridge Management and its shareholders, on the other hand. In managing and controlling us as the delegate of our general partner, Enbridge Management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit Enbridge and its shareholders or Enbridge Management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders. The following decisions, among others, could involve conflicts of interest: · whether we or Enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities; · whether we will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether we will purchase outstanding units; · whether Enbridge Management will issue additional shares; · the amount of payments to Enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for our benefit; 44 · the amount of costs that are reimbursable to Enbridge Management or Enbridge and its affiliates by us; · the enforcement of obligations owed to us by Enbridge Management, our general partner or Enbridge, including obligations regarding competition between Enbridge and us; and · the retention of separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us and Enbridge Management. In these and similar situations, any decision by Enbridge Management may benefit one group more than another, and in making such decisions, Enbridge Management may consider the interests of all groups, as well as other factors, in deciding whether to take a particular course of action. In other situations, Enbridge may take certain actions, including engaging in businesses that compete with us, that are adverse to us and our unitholders. For example, although Enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses, that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions: · Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses, including the normal development of such businesses, in which they were engaged at the time of our initial public offering in December 1991; · such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which we provided transportation at the time of our initial public offering; · Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us as part of a larger acquisition, so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired, in Enbridges reasonable judgment, is not attributable to the competitive business; and · Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us if that business is first offered for acquisition to us and the board of directors of Enbridge Management and our unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition. Since we were not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of our initial public offering, Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with us in any aspect of the natural gas business. In addition, Enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as our Lakehead system, even if such transportation is in direct material competition with our business. These exceptions also expressly permitted the reversal by Enbridge in 1999 of one of its pipelines that extends from Sarnia, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec. As a result of this reversal, Enbridge competes with us to supply crude oil to the Ontario, Canada market. We can issue additional common or other classes of units, including additional i-units to Enbridge Management when it issues additional shares, which would dilute your ownership interest. The issuance of additional common or other classes of units by us, including the issuance of additional i-units to Enbridge Management when it issues additional shares and the issuance of additional Class C units, other than our quarterly distributions to you, may have the following effects: · the amount available for distributions on each unit may decrease; · the relative voting power of each previously outstanding unit may decrease; and · the market price of the Class A common units may decline. 45 Additionally, the public sale by our general partner of a significant portion of the Class B common units or Class C units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the Class A common units. Our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to register for public sale any units held by the general partner or its affiliates. A public or private sale of the Class B common units or Class C units currently held by our general partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding Class A common units. We are a holding company and depend entirely on our operating subsidiaries distributions to service our debt obligations. We are a holding company with no material operations. If we cannot receive cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries, we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations. Our operating subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under agreements that contain restrictions, which could further limit each operating subsidiarys ability to make distributions to us. The debt securities we issue and any guarantees issued by the Subsidiary Guarantors will be structurally subordinated to the claims of the creditors of any of our operating subsidiaries who are not guarantors of the debt securities. Holders of the debt securities will not be creditors of our operating subsidiaries who have not guaranteed the debt securities. The claims to the assets of these non-guarantor operating subsidiaries derive from our own ownership interest in those operating subsidiaries. Claims of our non-guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of such operating subsidiaries over our own ownership interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of our debt, including the debt securities. Our non-guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors may include: · general creditors; · trade creditors; · secured creditors; · taxing authorities; and · creditors holding guarantees. Enbridge Managements discretion in establishing our cash reserves gives it the ability to reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Enbridge Management may establish cash reserves for us that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating and capital expenditures, provide for the proper conduct of business, and comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our holders of common units. RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT AND OUR ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE CASH Agreements relating to our debt restrict our ability to make distributions, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Units, and our ability to incur additional debt and otherwise maintain financial and operating flexibility. Our primary operating subsidiary is prohibited by its First Mortgage Notes from making distributions to us, and we are prohibited by our credit facility from making distributions to our unitholders, if a default exists under the respective governing agreements. In addition, the agreements governing our credit facility and our subsidiarys First Mortgage Notes may prevent us from engaging in transactions or capitalizing on 46 business opportunities that we believe could be beneficial to us by requiring us to comply with various covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on: · incurring additional debt; · entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of assets; and · granting liens. Although the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional debt, they impose restrictions on our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations and sales of assets and to incur liens to secure debt. A breach of any restriction under our credit facility or our indentures or our subsidiarys First Mortgage Notes could permit the holders of the related debt to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements immediately due and payable and, in the case of the credit facility, terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Any subsequent refinancing of our current debt or any new indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have similar or greater restrictions. TAX RISKS TO COMMON UNITHOLDERS We may be classified as an association taxable as a corporation rather than as a partnership, which would substantially reduce the value of our Class A common units. We could be treated as a corporation for United States income tax purposes. Our treatment as a corporation would substantially reduce the cash distributions on the common units that we distribute quarterly. Moreover, treatment of us as a corporation could materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities. The anticipated benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on the treatment of us as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Under current law, we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and do not pay any federal income tax at the entity level. In order to qualify for this treatment, we must derive more than 90% of our annual gross income from specified investments and activities. While we believe that we currently do qualify and intend to meet this income requirement, we may not find it possible, regardless of our efforts, to meet this income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this income requirement. Current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes without regard to our sources of income or otherwise subject us to entity-level taxation. If we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35% and would pay state income taxes at varying rates. Under current law, distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed as a corporate distribution. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, the cash available for distribution to a unitholder would be substantially reduced. Treatment of us as a corporation would cause a substantial reduction in the value of our units. In addition, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise, or other forms of taxation. State tax legislation resulting in the imposition of a partnership-level income tax on us would reduce the cash distributions on the common units and the value of the i-units that we will distribute quarterly to Enbridge Management. The enactment of significant legislation imposing partnership-level income taxes could cause a reduction in the value of our units. If the Internal Revenue Service does not respect our curative tax allocations, the after-tax return to our unitholders on their investment in our Class A common units would be adversely affected. Our partnership agreement allows curative allocations of income, deduction, gain and loss by us to account for differences between the tax basis and fair market value of property at the time the property is contributed or deemed contributed to us and to account for differences between the fair market value and book basis of our assets existing at the time of issuance of any Class A common units. If the Internal 47 Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, does not respect our curative allocations, ratios of taxable income to cash distributions received by the holders of Class A common units will be materially higher than previously estimated The tax liability of our unitholders could exceed their distributions or proceeds from sales of Class A common units. The holders of our Class A common units will be required to pay United States federal income tax and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their allocable share of our income, even if they do not receive cash distributions from us. They will not necessarily receive cash distributions equal to the tax on their allocable share of our taxable income. Further, if we have a large amount of nonrecourse liabilities, they may incur a tax liability that is greater than the money they receive when they sell their Class A common units. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states where we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business. In some cases, a unitholder may be required to file income tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states in which we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business, which are currently Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New York, South Carolina, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. In the future, we may acquire property or do business in other states or in foreign jurisdictions. In addition to tax liabilities to such state and foreign jurisdictions, the owner of a Class A common unit may also incur tax and filing responsibilities to localities within such jurisdictions. Ownership of Class A common units raises issues for tax-exempt entities and other investors. An investment in our Class A common units by tax-exempt entities, including employee benefit plans, individual retirement accounts, Keogh plans and other retirement plans, regulated investment companies and foreign persons raises issues unique to them. Virtually all of the income derived from our Class A common units by a tax-exempt entity will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to the tax-exempt entity. Further, a unitholder who is a nonresident alien, a foreign corporation or other foreign person will be required to file a federal income tax return and pay tax on his share of our taxable income because he will be regarded as being engaged in a trade or business in the United States as a result of his ownership of a Class A common unit. Our registration with the Secretary of the Treasury as a tax shelter may increase your risk of an IRS audit. Because we are a registered tax shelter with the Secretary of the Treasury, a unitholder may face an increased risk of an IRS audit resulting in taxes payable on our income as well as income not related to us. We could be audited by the IRS and adjustments to our income or losses could be made. Any unitholder owning less than a 1% profit interest in us has very limited rights to participate in the income tax and audit process. Further, any adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in the unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us. Each unitholder is responsible for any tax owed as the result of an examination of their personal tax return. 48 Our treatment of a purchaser of Class A common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller could be challenged, resulting in a reduction in value of the Class A common units. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of Class A common units, we are required to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of these units in the hands of the purchasers and sellers of these units. We do so by adopting certain depreciation conventions that do not conform to all aspects of the United States Treasury regulations. An IRS challenge to these conventions could adversely affect the tax benefits to a unitholder of ownership of the Class A common units and could have a negative impact on their value. Item 1B.
