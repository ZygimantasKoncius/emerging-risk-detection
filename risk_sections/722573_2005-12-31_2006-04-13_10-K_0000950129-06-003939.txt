Item 1A. Risk Factors Because we have no ongoing operations and no prospects of generating funds, we may not be able to continue in existence. At December 31, 2005:  We had a consolidated working capital deficiency of approximately $4.6 million.  We had a deficiency in shareholders equity of approximately $5.4 million.  Of our total cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 million at December 31, 2005, $0.2 million was held at Health Care Assurance Company, Ltd. The transfer of cash to MHP from Health Care Assurance Company, Ltd. requires the approval of regulatory authorities.  We had no means of generating cash or working capital.  The Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Insurance has made claims against us that may exceed $48.0 million and are far in excess of liabilities accrued by us in connection with the claims. Additionally, substantial claims may be made against us in connection with a pharmacy services agreement. As a result, we cannot give any assurance that it will not be necessary for us to seek protection under the Bankruptcy Code or liquidate without paying any consideration to our shareholders. Because our shares are not listed on a stock exchange, our shares are subject to the penny stock rules, which make it difficult to purchase or sell our shares. Our common stock is subject to the SECs penny-stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our stock to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. These rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of our shareholders to sell any common stock they may own. Item 1B.
