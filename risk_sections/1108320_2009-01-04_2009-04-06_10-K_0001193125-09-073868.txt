Item 1A: Risk Factors FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS A number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking in nature. The discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally. SMTC cautions readers that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on Form 10-K regarding SMTCs financial position and business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. All of these forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions made by SMTCs management, which although believed to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain. Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on such estimates and statements. No assurance can be given that any of such estimates or statements will be realized, and it is possible that actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include: (1) increased competition; (2) increased costs; (3) the inability to implement our business plan and maintain covenant compliance under our credit agreements; (4) the loss or retirement of key members of management; (5) increases in SMTCs cost of borrowings or lack of availability of additional debt or equity capital on terms considered reasonable by management; (6) adverse state, federal or foreign legislation or regulation or adverse determinations by regulators; (7) changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which SMTC may compete and fluctuations in demand in the electronics industry; (8) the inability to manage inventory levels efficiently in light of changes in market conditions; and (9) the inability to sustain historical margins as the industry develops. SMTC has attempted to identify certain of the factors that it currently believes may cause actual future experiences to differ from SMTCs current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area. In addition to the items specifically discussed in the foregoing, SMTCs business and results of operations are subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results 13 Table of Contents below. The operations and results of SMTCs business may also be subject to the effect of other risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, items described from time to time in SMTCs reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY The financial markets have recently experienced significant turmoil. If we attempt to obtain future financing or renegotiate our current financing, the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing. In addition, the credit market turmoil could negatively impact certain of our customers, certain of their customers, and our suppliers. These impacts could lead to a decrease in demand for our products, as well as our customers products, or a decrease in supply of our inputs, which could result in a negative effect on our results of operations or they could result in customers having insufficient financing to support their business. We are exposed to general economic conditions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. As a result of unfavorable economic conditions, reduced capital spending and changes in our customers manufacturing requirements, our sales declined during fiscal years 2002 to 2005 and in 2008 and going forward into 2009. In particular, sales to OEMs in the telecommunications and enterprise computing and networking industries worldwide were impacted. If general economic conditions deteriorate we may experience an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, since end customer demand for our customers products could be adversely affected. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial crisis, and the Companys ability to predict the effect such conditions will have on its customers, the Company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect that such an ongoing economic slowdown will have on it. A majority of our revenue comes from a small number of customers; if we lose any of our larger customers, our revenue could decline significantly. We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace in which current and prospective customers often seek to lower their costs through a competitive bidding process among EMS providers. This process creates an opportunity to increase revenue to the extent we are successful in the bidding process, however, there is also the potential for revenue decline to the extent we are unsuccessful in the process. Furthermore, even if we are successful, there is the potential for our margins to decrease. Three of our largest customers were Harris, MEI and Ingenico, representing 18.8%, 18.5% and 14.0% of total revenue for the quarter ended January 4, 2009, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2008, our top ten largest customers (which includes Ingenico, MEI and Harris) collectively represented 85.7% of our total revenue. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. In addition to having a limited number of customers, we manufacture a limited number of products for each of our customers. If we lose any of our largest customers or any product line manufactured for one of our largest customers, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenue. Also, the insolvency of one or more of our largest customers or the inability of one or more of our largest customers to pay for its orders could decrease revenue. As many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in net revenue can decrease our profit margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14 Table of Contents Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business. On August 7, 2008, we entered into an amended financing agreement with Wachovia Capital Finance Corporation (Wachovia) and Export Development Canada (EDC) to refinance the Companys short and long term debt (collectively, the Wachovia EDC facilities). Under the amendment, Wachovia improved certain borrowing base conditions based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable of the Company to allow increased borrowing capacity, increased the revolving facility from $40 million to $45 million, and provided a term debt of $0.8 million. Also under this amendment, EDC replaced Garrison as the main term debt lender. The proceeds from the EDC term debt of $13 million, together with the increased borrowing capacity, were used to repay the entire Garrison loan. The interest on the LIBOR based term debt to EDC has been reduced from LIBOR plus 4% to LIBOR plus 3.5%, decreasing at various leverage rates. Covenants were changed and restrictions on certain investments and expenditures. Our debt under the Wachovia EDC Facilities could have adverse consequences for our business, including:  We will be more vulnerable to adverse general economic conditions.  We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes.  We may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes.  We may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry.  We could be limited in our borrowing of additional funds and making strategic investments by restrictive covenants and the borrowing base formula in our credit arrangements.  We may fail to comply with covenants under which we borrowed our indebtedness, including various financial covenants under our Wachovia EDC Facilities. These covenants, applicable to specific twelve month rolling periods, include (i) a minimum consolidated EBITDA target, (ii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, (iii) a maximum total debt to EBITDA ratio, and (iv) maximum capital expenditures. Our failure to comply with covenants could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, it could result in all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, becoming immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such amounts, our lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the covenants under the Wachovia EDC Facilities.  Our Wachovia EDC Facilities contains subjective acceleration clauses. There can be no assurance that the lender will not exercise their rights to accelerate repayment under the terms of the agreement.  We could be limited in our borrowing of additional funds by the change in ownership of Wachovia or could otherwise be adversely affected by such change in ownership. There can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness to meet our financial and restrictive covenants and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, certain of which are beyond our control, as well as the availability of revolving credit borrowings under the Wachovia EDC Facilities or successor facilities. We are exposed to fluctuations in currencies, particularly the weakening of the US dollar. Most of our sales and component purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our Canadian and Mexican payroll, Euro based component purchases and other various expenses are denominated in local currencies. As a result, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk for modest changes in exchange rates. 15 Table of Contents However, for more significant changes in exchange rates, the Company is subject to much greater variations. Every $0.01 change in the US dollar results in a change in expenses of approximately $0.2 million. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar results in an increase in costs to the organization and may lead to a reduction in reported earnings. Our industry is very competitive and we may not be successful if we fail to compete effectively. The electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign EMS providers including Celestica Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Sanmina-SCI, Inc., Benchmark Electronics Inc. and Plexus Corp. In addition, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronics manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, electronics manufacturing services. Many of our competitors have larger international operations than us, and some have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources and lower cost structures than us. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of current and potential customers, which are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of using external manufacturers. We may experience variability in our operating results, which could negatively impact the price of our shares. Our annual and quarterly results have fluctuated in the past. The reasons for these fluctuations may similarly impact our business in the future. Prospective investors should not rely on results of operations in any past period to indicate what our results will be for any future period. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors, including:  variations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity;  variations in the timing of shipments of products to customers;  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products;  changes in demand for our customers existing products;  the accuracy of our customers forecasts of future production requirements;  effectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes, inventory levels and costs;  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets;  willingness of suppliers to supply the Company on normal credit terms; and  changes in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor. In addition, most of our customers typically do not commit to firm production schedules more than 30 to 90 days in advance. Accordingly, it is difficult for us to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty. As a result, we may not be able to schedule production to maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing, purchase materials and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers. Sometimes anticipated orders from certain customers have failed to materialize, and at times delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customers needs. Any material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from our larger customers could cause our revenue to decline. In addition, as many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. On other occasions, customers have required rapid and unexpected increases in production, which have placed burdens on our manufacturing capacity and adversely affected costs. Any of these factors or a combination of these factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 16 Table of Contents We are dependent upon the electronics industry, which produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles. Most of our customers are in the electronics industry, which is characterized by intense competition, short product life-cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand. In addition, the electronics industry is generally subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence. If our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment, their products could become obsolete and the demand for our services could significantly decline. Our success is largely dependent on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products. Furthermore, the electronics industry is subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced downturns. The continued recession or a downturn in the electronics industry would likely have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Consolidation in the electronics industry may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power or increasing competition. Consolidation in the electronics industry among our competitors and or our customers as companies merge to take advantage of the global credit challenges or to achieve other synergies may result in increasing or strengthening very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics industry. The significant buying and market power of these companies may increase competitive pressures on us. In addition, if any of our large customers is acquired or merged with another provider of similar services, we may lose that customer business. Consolidation may also result in excess manufacturing capacity among EMS companies driving down gross profit margins. Shortages or price fluctuations of component parts specified by our customers could delay product shipment and affect our profitability. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing. In turnkey manufacturing, we provide both the materials and the manufacturing services. If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may bear the risk of fluctuations in materials costs, scrap and excess inventory, all of which can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are required to forecast our future inventory requirements based upon the anticipated demands of our customers. Inaccuracies in making these forecasts or estimates could result in a shortage or an excess of materials. In addition, delays, cancellations or reductions of orders by our customers could result in an excess of materials. A shortage of materials could lengthen production schedules and increase costs. An excess of materials may increase the costs of maintaining inventory and may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence, both of which may increase expenses and decrease profit margins and operating income. Many of the products we manufacture require one or more components that we order from sole-source suppliers. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production of all products using that component or cause cost increases in the services we provide. In addition, in the past, some of the materials we use, such as memory and logic devices, have been subject to industry-wide shortages. As a result, suppliers allocate available quantities among their customers, and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials required. Our inability to obtain these materials could slow production or assembly, delay shipments to our customers, increase costs and reduce operating income. Also, we may bear the risk of periodic component price increases, which could reduce operating income. Also we rely on a variety of common carriers for materials transportation, and we route materials through various world ports. A work stoppage, strike or shutdown of a major port or airport could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or expediting charges, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents If we are unable to respond to rapidly changing technology and process development, we may not be able to compete effectively. The market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development. The future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, to develop and market services that meet changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. In addition, the EMS industry could in the future encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete or that reduce the demand for our services. There can be no assurance that we will effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market. To the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive, the development, acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments. There can be no assurance that capital will be available for these purposes in the future or that investments in new technologies will result in commercially viable technological processes. If our components and or products are defective, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation, and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims. Although, generally liability for these claims in our contracts rest with our customers, our customers may not, or may not have the resources to, satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility. If our product or component is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could incur significant expenditures to resolve the claim. In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available with respect to all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business and its results. We may encounter significant delays or defaults in payments owed to us by customers for products we have manufactured or components that are unique to particular customers. We structure our agreements with customers to mitigate our risks related to obsolete or unsold inventory. However, enforcement of these contracts may result in material expense and delay in payment for inventory. If any of our significant customers become unable or unwilling to purchase such inventory, our business may be materially harmed. We are subject to the risk of increased taxes. We base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. Our business will suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled employees. Our business depends on our ability to continue to recruit, train and retain skilled employees, particularly executive management, engineering and sales personnel. Recruiting personnel in our industry is highly 18 Table of Contents competitive. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to attract and retain management and existing employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel or attract qualified management in the future. In connection with our restructuring, we significantly reduced our workforce. If we receive a significant volume of new orders, we may have difficulty recruiting skilled workers back into our workforce to respond to such orders and accordingly may experience delays that could adversely affect our ability to meet customers delivery schedules. Risks particular to our international manufacturing operations could adversely affect our overall results. Our international manufacturing operations are subject to inherent risks, including:  fluctuations in the value of currencies and high levels of inflation;  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting amounts receivable;  unexpected changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;  political and economic instability;  increases in duties and taxation;  imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;  trade restrictions; and  dependence on key customers. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, which expose us to potential financial liability. Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use metals and other hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. We may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are or become contaminated by the release of hazardous materials, regardless of whether we caused such release. In addition we may be liable for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, if such sites become contaminated, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws. In the event of a contamination or violation of environmental laws, we could be held liable for damages including fines, penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits. Any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby having an adverse effect on our operations. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business. Our industry must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for its customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead-times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy for a number of reasons. Such changes, delays and cancellations may lead to our production and possession of excess or obsolete inventory which we may not be able to sell to the customer or a third party. The success of our customers products in the market affects our business. Cancellations, reductions, delays or changes in sourcing strategy by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results by reducing the number of products that we sell, delaying the payment to us for inventory that we purchased and reducing the use of our manufacturing facilities which have associated fixed costs not dependent on our level of revenue. 19 Table of Contents In addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results. Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business. Our design and manufacturing services offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement form third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers. In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims. In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all. If OEMS stop or reduce their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing, our business could suffer. Future growth in our revenues depends on new outsourcing opportunities in which we assume additional manufacturing and supply chain management responsibilities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers and the merits of manufacturing products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available, either because OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or because they use other providers of these services, our future growth would be limited. We are involved in various legal proceedings. In the past, we have been notified of claims relating to various matters including intellectual property rights, contractual matters or other issues arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of such a claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to defend or otherwise address the claim. Any litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Accordingly, the resolution or adjudication of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business. On August 3, 2007, we entered into a new credit agreement with Wachovia and Monroe Capital LLC to refinance the Companys short and long term debt. Under these banking arrangements, Wachovia had provided a $40 million revolving credit facility and Monroe had provided $21.5 million in term debt. During 2008, Garrison Capital purchased the term debt from Monroe. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a second amended and restated loan agreement in the US and Canada with Wachovia and EDC dated August 7, 2008, and maturing on August 12, 2012. Under the amendment, Wachovia amended certain borrowing base conditions based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable of the Company to allow increased borrowing 20 Table of Contents capacity and increased the revolving credit facility from $40 million to $45 million. Wachovia also provided a $0.8 million term loan, bearing interest based on the U.S. Prime rate. Also under this amendment, EDC replaced Garrison as the primary term debt lender. The proceeds from the EDC term debt of $13 million, together with the increased borrowing capacity, were used to repay the entire remaining Garrison loan. The EDC term debt bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.5%, decreasing at various leverage rates. Financial covenants were changed and restrictions on certain investments and expenditures have been removed. Our debt under the credit facilities could have adverse consequences for our business, including:  We are required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes.  We may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes.  We are limited by restrictive covenants and the borrowing base formula in our credit arrangements in our borrowing of additional funds.  The failure to comply with covenants under which we borrowed our indebtedness including the financial covenant under our credit facilities, which requires us to meet consolidated EBITDA, leverage and fixed coverage charge targets on a rolling 12 month basis and leverage targets on a monthly basis, may result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, it could result in all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, becoming immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such amounts, our lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities.  Our credit facilities contain certain subjective acceleration clauses. There can be no assurance that the lenders will not exercise their rights to accelerate repayment under the terms of the agreement. There can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, to meet our financial and restrictive covenants and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, certain of which are beyond our control, as well as the availability of revolving credit borrowings under our credit facilities or successor facilities. We face significant restrictions on our ability to operate under the terms of our credit facilities. The terms of our credit facilities generally restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, complete acquisitions, make certain investments, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, consummate certain asset sales, make capital expenditures, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, merge, consolidate or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of our assets (other than in the ordinary course of business). We are also required to maintain specified EBITDA levels under the credit facilities. The revolver portion of the credit facilities also has a borrowing base formula that limits our ability to borrow based on the characteristics of our accounts receivable and inventory. Substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are pledged as security under our credit facilities. If we are not able to comply with these covenants and requirements, customers may lose confidence in us and reduce or eliminate their orders with us, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it difficult for others to obtain control of us even though some stockholders might consider such a development favorable. Provisions in our charter, by-laws and certain provisions under Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management that stockholders consider favorable or 21 Table of Contents beneficial. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our shares could suffer. Shares of authorized but unissued common stock may be issued from time to time by our Board of Directors without further stockholder action unless such action is required by Delaware law, our charter, or the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock might be used in the context of a defense against or response to possible or threatened hostile takeovers. It is not possible to predict in advance whether the issuance of additional shares will have a dilutive effect on earnings per share as it depends on the specific events associated with a particular transaction. There may be adverse consequences resulting from future governmental tax audits of the Companys tax returns. The Company has taken various tax positions in determining its tax liabilities and the related expense. It is possible that future tax audits or changes in tax regulation may require the Company to change its prior period tax returns and also to incur additional costs. This may negatively affect future period results. Certain differences may exist between the trading market of our common stock and the trading market for the exchangeable shares of SMTC Canada Although the exchangeable shares of SMTC Canada are intended to be functionally and economically equivalent to shares of our common stock, there can be no assurance that the market price of the exchangeable shares will be identical, or even similar, to the market price of our common stock.
