Item 1A. Risk FactorsIn evaluating the Company, the factors described below should be carefully considered. The occurrence of one or more of these events could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the trading price of its common stock. The discussion below is focused on those risk factors management currently considers to be material. As the Company operates in a continually changing business environment, new risk factors may emerge from time to time and may become material. Additionally, the Company’s past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and should not be used to anticipate future results or future period trends.Political, economic, regulatory or other conditions in the countries in which Furmanite operates could adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flow of the Company.Operations in foreign jurisdictions accounted for approximately 33% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company expects foreign operations to continue to be an important part of its business. Foreign and domestic operations are subject to a variety of risks, such as:•risks of economic instability;•potential adverse changes in taxation policies;•disruptions from labor and political disturbances;•adverse changes in tariffs or import or export restrictions; and•terrorist acts, acts of war or insurrections.Terrorist acts, acts of war, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or national disasters may disrupt our operations, as well as those of our customers. These types of acts could weaken domestic and global economies and create additional uncertainties, thus forcing our customers to reduce their capital spending, or cancel or delay projects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, including loss of sales or customers.In addition, as a result of our global operations, we face a variety of special United States and international legal and compliance risks, as well as to the risks of our domestic business. These federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include environmental, health and safety regulations, data privacy requirements, international labor laws, anti-corruption and bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and U.K. Bribery Act, and trade sanctions laws and regulations. In the event new laws and regulations are enacted or existing laws are amended, implementing compliance with such new or amended laws may result in a loss of revenue, increased costs of doing business and a change to our strategic objectives, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of any of these laws.Although the Company takes reasonable measures to comply with the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act and to ensure that its employees, agents and intermediaries comply with the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, it cannot assure that such precautions will protect it against liability, particularly as a result of actions taken in the past, or which may be taken in the future for which the Company may have exposure under these laws. An actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, strategic objectives or cash flows.Weakness in the industries Furmanite serves could adversely affect demand for our services.A substantial portion of the business depends upon the levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures in the refining and chemical industries, as well as the power generation and other process industries. The levels of capital and maintenance expenditures by Furmanite’s customers are affected by general economic conditions, conditions in their industries and their liquidity, 7Table of Contents as well as cyclical downturns in these industries and fluctuations in oil prices. Continued weaknesses in the sectors served by Furmanite could adversely affect the demand for Furmanite’s services.Changes in the general economy affecting availability of credit may negatively impact the Company’s business.The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected during periods of economic downturn, and the timing and extent of such a decline in the global, or regional economies in which the Company operates, cannot be predicted. Lower levels of liquidity and capital adequacy affecting lenders, increases in defaults and bankruptcies by customers and suppliers, and volatility in credit and equity markets could negatively affect the Company’s business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition in a number of ways, including reductions in revenues and profits, increased bad debts, and financial instability of suppliers and insurers. Furthermore, it may be more difficult or costly to access or obtain, in the future, working capital or acquisition opportunity financing.The Company may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign exchange restrictions.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies, which represent a significant portion of total revenues, and certain costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary foreign currencies of the Company are the Euro, British pound and Australian dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2013, foreign currency based revenues and operating income were $141.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively. Based on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company estimates that a ten percent fluctuation of all applicable foreign currencies would result in an annual change in revenues and operating income of $12.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively.Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could result in reduced demand for the Company’s services and products.The adoption and implementation of any regulations which impose limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from customers for whom the Company provides repair and maintenance services could adversely affect demand for the Company’s services and products. Furthermore, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur in regions where the Company operates, it could have an adverse effect on the Company’s assets and operations. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies thereunder, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from operations of the Company, could result in costs and liabilities to the Company.Furmanite’s services and products are offered in highly competitive markets, which limits the profit margins and the ability to increase market share.The markets for Furmanite’s services and products are highly competitive. Furmanite competes against large and well established national and international companies as well as regional and local companies. Furmanite also competes with the in-house maintenance departments of customers or potential customers. Competition is based on service, performance and price. If Furmanite does not compete successfully, the business and results of operations could be adversely affected.The competitive position of Furmanite depends in part on the ability to protect its intellectual property.The competitive position of Furmanite depends in part upon techniques and materials that are proprietary and, in some cases, patented. The Company holds over 120 trademarks and patents for its techniques, products, materials and equipment. These patents are registered around the world and expire at various dates through May 2032. Although Furmanite believes it has taken appropriate steps to protect the intellectual property from misappropriation, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the foreign countries. In addition, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary techniques.The Company is exposed to customer credit risks.The Company is subject to risks of loss resulting from delinquent payment, nonpayment or nonperformance or other obligations by its customers. If key customers default on their obligations, the financial results of the Company could be adversely affected. Furthermore, some of the Company’s customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks which may also limit their ability to pay or perform.8Table of Contents Unsatisfactory safety performance can affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs and otherwise negatively impact our business. Our employees and others are subject to the normal hazards associated with the Company providing services at industrial facilities. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to many negative consequences including personal injury, loss of life, destruction of property, and environmental damage. Although we are committed to maintaining a strong safety culture and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level, there can be no assurance these efforts will be effective. Poor safety performance may harm the Company’s reputation and limit or eliminate potential revenue streams from many of our largest customers and may materially increase our future insurance and other operating costs. The Company is involved and is likely to continue to be involved in legal proceedings, which if adversely determined, could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.We are currently a defendant in various legal proceedings arising from the operations of our current and historical business and it is reasonable to expect that we will be named in future actions. Most of the legal proceedings against us arise out of the normal course of performing services at customer facilities, and include various types of claims including tort, contractual, workers’ compensation, personal injury, and property damage, business interruption, and indemnification. Legal proceedings can be expensive to defend, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a liability claim could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Although we maintain insurance coverage against these and other risks associated with our business, this insurance may not protect us against liability from certain events. We cannot assure that our insurance will be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur. Moreover, we cannot assure that we will be able in the future to obtain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any future damages that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.If the Company loses any key personnel, the ability to manage the business and continue the growth of the Company could be negatively impacted.The Company’s success is highly dependent on the efforts of its executive officers and key employees. If any of the Company’s key employees leave, its business may suffer. The growth of the Company’s business is also largely dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of its business, including technicians and management. If the Company is unable to attract and retain such qualified personnel, it may be forced to limit growth, and its business and operating results could suffer. Organizational changes within the Company could also impact its ability to retain personnel.Business acquisitions may expose the Company to various risks.From time to time, we make acquisitions of other businesses that enhance or expand our service offerings or capabilities. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business. Even with prudent planning, acquisitions may present unforeseen challenges, such as integration difficulties or unexpected costs. No assurances can be made that we will realize the level of revenues, earnings, cost savings, synergies, or any other benefits that we may anticipate from an acquisition, or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect. If we are not able to address challenges that may arise with a particular acquisition, our financial performance could be adversely impacted. Further, the consideration given for acquisitions could include an assumption of liabilities, both those known and unknown. The consideration paid and integration efforts required in connection with an acquisition may also affect our share price or future financial results depending on many factors. Item 1B.
