D. Risk Factors An investment in our securities involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this annual report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, before you decide to purchase our securities. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price and value of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. 17 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business and the Markets in Which We Operate Difficult conditions in the global economy and in the global capital markets have caused, and may continue to cause, a sharp reduction in worldwide demand for our products and services, and negatively impact our access to the levels of financing necessary for the successful development of our existing and future projects and the successful refinancing of our corporate indebtedness Our results of operations have been, and continue to be, materially affected by conditions in the global economy and in the global capital markets. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, sovereign debt and the instability of the euro have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and global capital markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining global business and consumer confidence and rising unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and have led to a recession and weak economic growth. The economic instability and uncertainty may affect the willingness of companies to make capital expenditures and investment in the markets in which we operate. These events and continuing disruptions in the global economy and in the global capital markets may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility with certain factors, including consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of capital markets, inflation affecting the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. Generalized or localized downturns or inflationary pressures in our key geographical areas could also have a material adverse effect on the performance of our business. A significant portion of our business activity is concentrated in Spain, Brazil and the United States, and we are significantly affected by the general economic conditions in these countries. Spain has recently experienced negative economic conditions, including high unemployment and significant government debt which we believe could adversely affect our operations in the near future. We are a Spanish company and our share capital is denominated in euro. The effects on the European and global economy of any exit of one or more member states (each a "Member State") from the Eurozone, the dissolution of the euro and the possible redenomination of our share capital, financial instruments or other contractual obligations from euro into a different currency, or the perception that any of these events are imminent, are inherently difficult to predict and could give rise to operational disruptions or other risks of contagion to our business and have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, to the extent uncertainty regarding the European economic recovery continues to negatively impact government or regional budgets or demand for our environmental services, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, many of our customers are continually seeking to implement measures aimed at greater cost savings, including efforts to improve cost efficiencies. These and other factors could therefore result in our customers reducing their budgets for spending on our products and services. The global capital and credit markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility and disruption since the last half of 2008. Continued disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the global capital and credit markets may limit our access to additional capital required to operate or grow our business, including our access to non-recourse project finance which we use to fund many of our projects, even in cases where such capital has already been committed. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to grow our business, or replace financing previously committed for a project that ceases to be available to it. As a result, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities than we prefer, or bear a higher cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. In the event that we are required to replace previously committed financing to certain projects that subsequently becomes unavailable, we may have to postpone or cancel planned capital expenditures or construction projects. 18 Table of Contents Decreases in government budgets, reductions in government subsidies and adverse changes in law may adversely affect our business and the development of existing and new projects Economic instability and difficult economic conditions in Spain have resulted in a decline in tax revenue obtained by our public administration customers at a time of rising public sector deficits. For example, reductions in government infrastructure budgets have had a significant impact on our results of operations as a substantial percentage of our revenue is derived from services we provide as a contractor or subcontractor on various projects with governmental entities, including state-owned companies. Poor economic conditions have affected, and continue to affect, government budgets and threaten the continuation of government subsidies such as regulated revenues, cash grants, U.S. federal income tax benefits and other similar subsidies that benefit our business, particularly with respect to renewable energy. Such conditions may also lead to adverse changes in laws. For example, in the United States, due to the failure of the U.S. Congress to enact a plan by February 28, 2013 to reduce the federal budget deficit by $1.2 trillion, $85 billion of automatic budget cuts (known as "sequestration") went into effect on March 1, 2013 reducing discretionary spending by all agencies of the federal government for the remainder of the federal fiscal year ending September 30, 2013. These cuts affected, among others, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's, or the U.S. Treasury, program providing for cash grants in lieu of investment tax credits ("ITCs"). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 was approved in December 2013. This budget agreement replaces $63 billion in sequester cuts over two years split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. Both defense and non-defense programs will receive approximately $22.4 billion more in the government fiscal year ending September 30, 2014 than would otherwise have been allocated under the sequestration scenario. The discretionary spending levels for government fiscal years 2014 and 2015 have been set. While this budget agreement provides some near-term relief, sequestration, reduction in government spending in lieu of sequestration and fiscal issues raised by negotiations over the federal debt ceiling remain a long-term concern. See "Item 4.BRegulationUnited States RegulationsSolar RegulationRenewal Energy Tax Incentives in the United StatesSection 1603 Treasury Grant Program." In addition, a number of states and municipal authorities are experiencing severe fiscal pressures as they seek to address mounting budget deficits. The reduction or elimination of such subsidies or adverse changes in law could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our existing projects and the lack of availability of new projects undertaken in reliance on the continuation of such subsidies could adversely affect our growth plan. The revenue from the solar and biofuel projects that we undertake in our Concession-Type Infrastructures and Industrial Production activities, respectively, may be adversely affected if there is a decline in public acceptance and support of renewable energy Certain persons, associations and groups of people could oppose renewable energy projects, citing, for example, misuse of water resources, landscape degradation, land use, food scarcity or price increase and harm to the environment. Moreover, regulation may restrict the development of renewable energy plants in certain areas. In order to develop a renewable energy project, a solar power plant, or other infrastructure project, we are typically required to obtain, among other things, environmental impact permits or other authorizations and building permits, which in turn require environmental impact studies to be undertaken and public hearings and comment periods to be held during which any person, association or group may oppose a project. Any such opposition may be taken into account by government officials responsible for granting the relevant permits, which could result in the permits being delayed or not being granted or being granted solely on the condition that we carry out certain corrective measures to the proposed project. As a result, we cannot guarantee that all of the renewable energy plants or infrastructure that we currently plan to develop or, to the extent applicable, are developing will ultimately be authorized or accepted by the local authorities or the local population. For example, the local population could oppose the construction of a renewable energy plant or infrastructure at the local government level, which could in turn lead to the imposition of more restrictive requirements. 19 Table of Contents In certain jurisdictions, if a significant portion of the local population were to mobilize against the construction of a renewable energy plant or infrastructure, it may become difficult, or impossible, for us to obtain or retain the required building permits and authorizations. Moreover, such challenges could result in the cancellation of existing building permits or even, in extreme cases, the dismantling of, or the retroactive imposition of changes in the design of, existing renewable energy plants or infrastructure. A decrease in acceptance of renewable energy plants or infrastructure by local populations, an increase in the number of legal challenges, or an unfavorable outcome of such legal challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on certain regulations, subsidies and tax incentives that may be changed or legally challenged We rely in a significant part on environmental and other regulation of industrial and local government activities, including regulations mandating, among other things, reductions in carbon or other greenhouse gas emissions and minimum biofuel content in fuel or use of energy from renewable sources. If the businesses to which such regulations relate were deregulated or if such regulations were materially changed or weakened, the profitability of our current and future projects could suffer, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, uncertainty regarding possible changes to any such regulations has adversely affected in the past, and may adversely affect in the future, our ability to finance or refinance a project or to satisfy other financing needs. Subsidy regimes for renewable energy generation have been challenged in the past on constitutional and other grounds (including that such regimes constitute impermissible European Union state aid) in certain jurisdictions. In addition, certain loan guarantee programs in the United States, including those which have enabled the U.S. Department of Energy (the "DOE") to provide loan guarantees to support our Solana, Mojave and Hugoton projects, have been challenged on grounds of failure by the appropriate authorities to comply with applicable U.S. federal administrative and energy law. If all or part of the subsidy and incentive regimes for renewable energy generation in any jurisdiction in which we operate were found to be unlawful and, therefore, reduced or discontinued, we may be unable to compete effectively with conventional and other renewable forms of energy or we may be unable to complete certain ongoing projects. For more information regarding recent adverse regulatory developments in Spain, see "Item 4.BRegulationSpainSolar Regulatory FrameworkRoyal Decree Law 9/2013." The production from our renewable energy facilities is the subject of various tax relief measures or tax incentives in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These tax relief and tax incentive measures play an important role in the profitability of our projects. In the future, it is possible that some or all of these tax incentives will be suspended, curtailed, not renewed or revoked. For example, our Solana and Mojave projects are reliant on the ITC cash grant program to repay a significant portion of their respective external debt financing and the failure to receive anticipated funds, or any funds at all, pursuant to the ITC cash grant would have an adverse effect on our ability to receive distributions from our Solana and Mojave projects. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect the profitability of our current plants and our ability to refinance projects, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in a number of different jurisdictions, and our inability to comply with existing regulations or requirements or changes in applicable regulations or requirements may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition We are subject to extensive regulation of our business in the United States, Mexico, Spain, Peru, Brazil and in each of the other countries in which we operate. Such laws and regulations require licenses, permits and other approvals to be obtained in connection with the operations of our activities. This regulatory 20 Table of Contents framework imposes significant actual, day-to-day compliance burdens, costs and risks on us. In particular, the power plants and transmission lines that we operate in our Concession-Type Infrastructures and Industrial Production activities are subject to strict international, national, state and local regulations relating to their development, construction and operation (including, among other things, land acquisition, leasing and use of land, and the corresponding building permits, landscape conservation, noise regulation, environmental protection and environmental permits and energy power transmission and distribution network congestion regulations). Non-compliance with such regulations could result in the revocation of permits, sanctions, fines or even criminal penalties. Compliance with regulatory requirements, which may in the future include increased exposure to capital markets regulations, may result in substantial costs to our operations that may not be recovered. In addition, we cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory or law enforcement initiatives. Changes in existing energy, environmental and administrative laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, margins and investments. Our business may also be affected by additional taxes imposed on our activities, reduction of regulated tariffs and other cuts or measures. For example, in late 2012 and throughout 2013 the Spanish government established new taxes on electricity production, eliminated certain premiums previously payable on renewable power generation, reduced adjustments for changes in the consumer price index and took other measures, some of which remain subject to further regulatory development, which materially adversely affected our thermo-solar electricity generation activity in Spain, and which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as a whole. See "Item 4.BRegulationSpainSolar Regulatory Framework" for further information. Further, similar changes in laws and regulations could increase the size and number of claims and damages asserted against us or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and even criminal penalties. In addition, changes in laws and regulations may, in certain cases, have retroactive effect and may cause the result of operations to be lower than expected. In particular, our activities in the energy sector are subject to regulations applicable to the economic regime of generation of electricity from renewable sources and to subsidies or public support in the benefit of the production of biofuels from renewable energy sources, which vary by jurisdiction, and are subject to modifications that may be more restrictive or unfavorable to us. Our business is subject to stringent environmental regulation We are subject to significant environmental regulation, which, among other things, requires us to perform environmental impact studies on future projects or changes to projects, obtain regulatory licenses, permits and other approvals and comply with the requirements of such licenses, permits and other approvals. There can be no assurance that: governmental authorities will approve these environmental impact studies; public opposition will not result in delays, modifications to or cancellation of any proposed project or license; or laws or regulations will not change or be interpreted in a manner that increases our costs of compliance or materially or adversely affects our operations or plants or our plans for the companies in which we have an investment or to which we provide our services. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable regulations, including those governing the environment. While we employ robust policies with regard to environmental regulation compliance, there are occasions where regulations are breached. On occasion, we have been found not to be in compliance with certain environmental regulations, and have incurred fines and penalties associated with such violations which to date have not been material in amount. We can give no assurance, however, that we will continue to be in compliance or avoid material fines, penalties, sanctions and expenses associated with compliance issues in the future. Violation of such regulations may give rise to significant liability, including fines, damages, fees and expenses, and site closures. Generally, relevant governmental authorities are empowered to clean up and remediate releases of environmental damage and to charge the costs of such 21 Table of Contents remediation and cleanup to the owners or occupiers of the property, the persons responsible for the release and environmental damage, the producer of the contaminant and other parties, or to direct the responsible parties to take such action. These governmental authorities may also impose a tax or other liens on the responsible parties to secure the parties' reimbursement obligations. In Brazil, environmental liability applies to any individual or legal entity (whether public or private) that directly or indirectly causes, by action or omission, any damage to the environment. A sole fact may result in liability of three types (civil, administrative and criminal) independently or cumulatively. Brazilian courts may even lift the corporate veil in circumstances where a company is found to evade an environmental obligation to indemnify damage. When the veil of the corporation is lifted, the shareholders, rather than Abengoa itself, may be personally liable to redress the damage. Environmental regulation has changed rapidly in recent years, and it is possible that we will be subject to even more stringent environmental standards in the future. For example, our activities are likely to be covered by increasingly strict national and international standards relating to climate change and related costs, and may be subject to potential risks associated with climate change, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot predict the amounts of any increased capital expenditures or any increases in operating costs or other expenses that we may incur to comply with applicable environmental, or other regulatory, requirements, or whether these costs can be passed on to customers through product price increases. New regulations related to "conflict minerals" may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for listed companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The term "conflict minerals" encompasses tantalum, tin, tungsten (and their ores) and gold. These requirements, which become applicable beginning in May 2014, will require companies to conduct due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We are continuing to assess whether conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of any of our products or services. If so, the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in our products or services. In addition, we could incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products or services. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products or services through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who could require that all of the components of our products are conflict mineral-free. We face pressure to improve the competitiveness of our renewable energy services and products To ensure our long-term future, we must be able to compete on a non-subsidized basis with conventional and other renewable energy sources. The current levels of government support for renewable energy are generally intended to grant the industry a "grace period" to reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity or per gasoline gallon equivalent generated through technological advances, cost reductions and process improvements. Consequently, and as generation or production costs decrease, this level of government support is likely to be gradually phased out for many critical projects in the future, although existing and commissioned projects are expected to continue to benefit from feed-in tariffs or similar government incentives as already set. In the medium-to long-term, a gradual but significant reduction of the tariffs, premiums and incentives for renewable energy is likely. If these reductions continue and/or increase, market participants, including ourselves, may need to reduce prices to remain competitive against other alternatives. If cost reductions and product innovations do not occur, or occur at a slower pace than is 22 Table of Contents required to achieve the necessary price reductions, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face significant competition from other renewable energy providers. With regard to the solar industry, we believe it may see significantly increased competition, as a result of new market entrants and/or substitute renewable energy sources due to increased demand for renewable energy sources. Other contributing factors to this increased competition are lower barriers to entry in these markets due to the increased standardization of technologies, improved funding opportunities and increased governmental support. Although we endeavor to maintain our competitiveness, no assurance can be given that we will succeed. Our failure to compete successfully would negatively impact our ability to grow our business and generate revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increases in the cost of energy and gas could significantly increase our operating costs Some of our activities require significant consumption of energy and gas, and we are vulnerable to material fluctuations in their prices. Although our energy and gas purchase contracts generally include indexing mechanisms, we cannot guarantee that these mechanisms will cover all of the additional costs generated by an increase in energy and gas prices, particularly for long-term contracts, and some of the contracts entered into by us do not include any indexing provisions. Significant increases in the cost of energy or gas, or shortages of the supply of energy and/or gas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business has substantial capital expenditure requirements which requires us to have access to the global capital markets for financing We have significant capital expenditure requirements which necessitates continued access to the global capital markets, as well as R&D&i costs and extensive construction costs for power transmission lines, solar power plants and installations, co-generation power plants, infrastructure for the production of ethanol and desalination plants. Our capital expenditure and R&D&i requirements depend on the number and type of projects we undertake in the future. Under concessions and other agreements, we have committed to certain future capital expenditures (see "Item 5.AOperating ResultsFactors Affecting Our Results of OperationsCapital Expenditures"). Any recovery of our capital expenditures and R&D&i requirements, especially those made in respect of our concessions, will occur over a substantial period of time. Moreover, we may be unable to recoup our investments in these projects due to delays, cost overruns and general timing issues as to when revenue can be derived from these projects. We must also continue to make significant expenditures on R&D&i in order to maintain and improve our competitive position. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Any failure by us to react quickly and effectively to technological changes, or to obtain necessary financing to conduct appropriate R&D&i activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Transactions with counterparties exposes us to credit risk which we must effectively manage to mitigate the effect of counterparty defaults We are exposed to the credit risk implied by default on the part of a counterparty (a customer, provider, partner or financial entity), which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we actively manage this credit risk through the use of non-recourse factoring contracts, which involves banks and third parties assuming a counterparty's credit risk, and credit insurance, our risk management strategy may not be successful in limiting our exposure to credit risk, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 23 Table of Contents We may be subject to increased finance expenses if we do not effectively manage our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Some of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, generally linked to market benchmarks such as EURIBOR and LIBOR. Any increase in interest rates would increase our finance expenses relating to our variable rate indebtedness and increase the costs of refinancing our existing indebtedness and issuing new debt (see "Item 5.AOperating ResultsFactors Affecting Our Results of OperationsInterest Rates"). In addition, we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of the countries in which we operate. As we continue expanding our business into existing markets such as North America and Latin America, and into new markets such as the Middle East, Africa, India, China and Australia, we expect that a large and increasing percentage of our revenue and cost of sales will be denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency, the euro. As a result, we will become subject to increasing currency translation risk, whereby changes in exchange rates between the euro and the other currencies in which we do business could result in foreign exchange losses. We seek to actively manage these risks by entering into interest rate options and swaps to hedge against interest rate risk and future currency sale and purchase contracts and foreign exchange rate swaps to hedge against foreign exchange rate risk. If our risk management strategies are not successful in limiting our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitive position could be adversely affected by changes in technology, prices, industry standards and other factors The markets in which our activities operate change rapidly because of technological innovations and changes in prices, industry standards, product instructions, customer requirements and the economic environment. New technology or changes in industry and customer requirements may render existing products or services obsolete, excessively costly or otherwise unmarketable. As a result, we must continuously enhance the efficiency and reliability of our existing technologies and seek to develop new technologies in order to remain at the forefront of industry standards and customer requirements. If we are unable to introduce and integrate new technologies into our products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, our competitive position will suffer and our prospects for growth will be impaired. The delivery of our products and services to our customers and our performance under our contracts with our customers may be adversely affected by problems related to our reliance on third-party contractors and suppliers The supply of some of our contracts includes services, equipment or software which we subcontract to subcontractors, and some of our key products and services use items from third-party suppliers. The delivery of products or services which are not in compliance with the requirements of the subcontract, or the late supply of products and services, can cause us to be in default under our contracts with our customers. To the extent we are not able to transfer all of the risk or be fully indemnified by third-party contractors and suppliers, we may be subject to a claim by our customers as a result of a problem caused by a third-party that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by risks associated with acquisitions or investments in joint ventures with third parties If we decide to make certain acquisitions or financial investments in order to expand or diversify our business, we may take on additional debt to pay for such acquisitions. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete all, or any, such external expansion or diversification transactions that we might contemplate in the future. To the extent we do, such transactions expose us to risks inherent in integrating 24 Table of Contents acquired businesses and personnel, such as the inability to achieve projected synergies; difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; recognition of unexpected liabilities or costs; and regulatory complications arising from such transactions. Furthermore, the terms and conditions of financing for such acquisitions or financial investments could restrict the manner in which we conduct our business, particularly if we were to use debt financing. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have made significant investments in certain strategic development projects with third parties, including governmental entities and private entities. In certain cases, these projects are developed pursuant to joint venture agreements over which we only have partial or joint control. Investments in projects over which we have partial or joint control are subject to the risk that the other shareholders of the joint venture, who may have different business or investment strategies than us or with whom we may have a disagreement or dispute, may have the ability to block business, financial or management decisions, such as the decision to distribute dividends or appoint members of management, which may be crucial to the success of the project or our investment in the project, or otherwise implement initiatives which may be contrary to our interests. Our partners may be unable, or unwilling, to fulfill their obligations under the relevant joint venture agreements and shareholder agreements or may experience financial or other difficulties that may adversely impact our investment in a particular joint venture. In certain of our joint ventures, we may also be reliant on the particular expertise of our partners and, as a result, any failure to perform our obligations in a diligent manner could also adversely impact the joint venture. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog of unfilled orders is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, not a fully accurate indicator of our future revenue or earnings At December 31, 2013, our backlog was €6,796 million. Our backlog represents management's estimate of the amount of contract awards that we expect to result in future revenue. Backlog is calculated based on the same criteria for each of our activities. A project for which the related contract has been signed is included in the calculation of the project portfolio value. A signed contract represents a legally binding agreement, meaning a secure revenue source in the future. The sole exception is concentrated solar power ("CSP") plants for engineering, construction and construction ("EPC") projects, which are considered in the amount of our backlog despite not having a contract signed, as they have been granted a feed-in tariff. Furthermore, we do not include in backlog predicted sales from our concession activities, such as energy sales, power transmission and water sales or commodity sales, or our industrial production activities, such as biofuel sales. Our backlog does include expected revenue based on engineering and design specifications that may not be final and could be revised over time, and also includes expected revenue for government and maintenance contracts that may not specify actual monetary amounts for the work to be performed. For these contracts, our backlog is based on an estimate of work to be performed, which is based on our knowledge of our customers' stated intentions. See "Item 5.AOperating ResultsFactors Affecting Our Results of OperationsBacklog and Concessions" and "Item 4.BBusiness Overview" for more information. Furthermore, our ability to execute our backlog is dependent on our ability to meet our operational and financing needs, and if we are unable to meet such needs, our ability to execute our backlog could be adversely affected, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profit. Because of project terminations or suspensions and changes in project scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when, or if, our backlog will be actualized. We can provide no assurance that we will not receive additional cancellations, and, even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. Material delays, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 25 Table of Contents Our definition of backlog may not necessarily be the same as that used by other companies engaged in activities similar to ours. As a result, the amount of our backlog may not be comparable to the backlog reported by such other companies. We have international operations, including in emerging markets, that could be subject to economic, social and political uncertainties We operate our activities in a range of international locations, including Australia, Latin America (including Brazil), China, India, North America, the Middle East and Africa, and expect to expand our operations into new locations in the future. Accordingly, we face a number of risks associated with operating in different countries that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, adapting to the regulatory requirements of such countries, compliance with changes in laws and regulations applicable to foreign corporations, the uncertainty of judicial processes, and the absence, loss or non-renewal of favorable treaties, or similar agreements, with local authorities or political, social and economic instability, all of which can place disproportionate demands on our management, as well as significant demands on our operational and financial personnel and business. As a result, we can provide no assurance that our future international operations will remain successful. In addition, we conduct business in various emerging countries worldwide. Our activities in these countries involve a number of risks that are more prevalent than in developed markets, such as economic and governmental instability, the possibility of significant amendments to, or changes in, the application of governmental regulations, the nationalization and expropriation of private property, payment collection difficulties, social problems, substantial fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, changes in the tax framework or the unpredictability of enforcement of contractual provisions, currency control measures limits on the repatriation of funds and other unfavorable interventions or restrictions imposed by public authorities. For example, certain of our contracts in countries such as Peru or Mexico, are payable in local currency at the exchange rate of the payment date. In the event of a rapid devaluation or implementation of exchange or currency controls, we may not be able to exchange the local currency for the agreed dollar amount, which could affect our liquidity position. Governments in Latin American frequently intervene in the economies of their respective countries and occasionally make significant changes in policy and regulations. Governmental actions in certain Latin American countries to control inflation and other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, price controls, currency devaluations, capital controls and limits on imports. In addition, in recent months, political upheaval, civil unrest and, in some cases, regime change and armed conflict, have occurred in certain countries in the Middle East and Africa, including Egypt, Syria, Libya and Tunisia. Such events have increased political instability and economic uncertainty in certain countries in the Middle East and Africa where we currently operate or may seek to operate. Although our activities in emerging markets are not concentrated in any specific country (other than Brazil), the occurrence of one or more of these risks in a country or region in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor 26 Table of Contents compliance. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. Our growth may be limited by our inability to obtain new sites and expand existing ones Our ability to maintain our competitive position and meet our growth objectives for our operations and, in particular, our Industrial Production activity and the Co-generation segment of our Concession-Type Infrastructures activity depend on our ability to upgrade existing sites or acquire or lease additional sites in strategically located areas. Our ability to obtain new sites and expand existing sites is limited by regulation and geographic considerations. Government restrictions, including environmental, public health and technical restrictions, limit where our facilities and plants can be located. The process of obtaining planning permission and licenses or permits to build, operate or expand our facilities and plants involve extended hearings and compliance with planning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. We may not be successful in obtaining the planning permissions, licenses or permits we require or such planning permissions, license or permits may contain onerous terms and conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, objections from the public are capable of delaying, and even preventing, the proposed construction of a new or expanded facility or plant and the operation of a facility or plant. As a result, we may not be able to obtain extra site capacity where it is required. In some instances, it is also necessary for us to negotiate separate agreements with local authorities and third parties, such as landowners, who can make demands for additional obligations. Our solar power plants can only be constructed in locations with suitable weather conditions, sufficient levels of solar radiation, access to water and suitable topographic features. Accordingly, the number of feasible sites available for solar power plants is limited in many countries, including Spain and the United States, particularly as growth in the number of installed solar plants can restrict the number of sites available for additional plants; recent growth in the number of solar energy operators has increased competition for available sites. Moreover, although we undertake extensive studies before investing in the development of any particular site, the sites we choose to develop might not perform to our expectations. If these constraints on the establishment of solar power plants were to intensify, or if the sites we ultimately choose to develop do not perform as expected, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The construction projects in our Engineering and Construction activity and the facilities we operate in our Concession-Type Infrastructures and Industrial Production activities are inherently dangerous workplaces at which hazardous materials are handled. If we fail to maintain safe work environments, we can be exposed to significant financial losses, as well as civil and criminal liabilities The construction projects we undertake in our Engineering and Construction activity and the facilities we operate in our Concession-Type Infrastructures and Industrial Production activity often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, manufacturing or industrial processes, heat or liquids stored under pressure and highly regulated materials. On most projects and at most facilities, we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safe practices and safety procedures. If we fail to design and implement such practices and procedures or if the practices and procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured and our and others 27 Table of Contents property may become damaged. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our customers or the operation of a facility, and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our projects and the operation of our facilities can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. In addition, we may incur liability based on allegations of illness or disease resulting from exposure of employees or other persons to hazardous materials that we handle or are present in our workplaces. Our safety record is critical to our reputation. Many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts, and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some, or all, of its contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. As a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may be adversely affected by catastrophes, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, unexpected geological or other physical conditions, or criminal or terrorist acts at one or more of our plants, facilities and construction sites If one or more of our plants, facilities or construction sites were to be subject in the future to fire, flood or a natural disaster, adverse weather conditions, terrorism, power loss or other catastrophe, or if unexpected geological or other adverse physical conditions were to develop at any of our plants, facilities or construction sites, we may not be able to carry out our business activities at that location or such operations could be significantly reduced. This could result in lost revenue at these sites during the period of disruption and costly remediation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, despite security measures taken by us, it is possible that our sites relating to our Concession-Type Infrastructures and Industrial Production activities or other sites, could be affected by criminal or terrorist acts. Any such acts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance may be insufficient to cover relevant risks and the cost of our insurance may increase Our business is exposed to the inherent risks in the markets in which we operate. Although we seek to obtain appropriate insurance coverage in relation to the principal risks associated with our business, we cannot guarantee that such insurance coverage is, or will be, sufficient to cover all of the possible losses we may face in the future. If we were to incur a serious uninsured loss or a loss that significantly exceeded the coverage limits established in our insurance policies, the resulting costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our insurance policies are subject to review by our insurers. If the level of premiums were to increase in the future, or certain types of insurance coverage were to become unavailable, we might not be able to maintain insurance coverage comparable to those that are currently in effect at comparable cost, or at all. If we were unable to pass any increase in insurance premiums on to our customers, such additional costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 28 Table of Contents We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings We are subject to the risk of legal claims and proceedings and regulatory enforcement actions in the ordinary course of our business and otherwise. The results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. We cannot guarantee that the results of current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations nor can we guarantee that we will not incur losses in connection with current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions that exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or that exceed any available insurance coverage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are currently subject to various claims, proceedings, actions and investigations, including relating to possible anti-competitive practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Item 8.ALegal Proceedings." Unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by third parties may reduce the value of our products, services and brand, and impair our ability to compete effectively We rely across our business on a combination of trade secret and intellectual property laws, non-disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. These measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third-party infringement and, notwithstanding any remedies available, could subject us to increased competition or cause us to lose market share. In addition, these measures may not protect us from the claims of employees and other third parties. We also face risks with respect to the protection of our proprietary technology because the markets where our products are sold include jurisdictions that provide less protection for intellectual property than is provided under the laws of the United States or the European Union. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property could weaken our competitive position, reduce the value of our products, services and brand, and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may suffer if we are sued for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties We are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging our infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. In the future, third parties may assert infringement claims, alleging infringement by our current, or future, services or solutions. These claims may result in protracted and costly litigation, may subject us to liability if we are found to have infringed upon third parties' intellectual property rights, and, regardless of the merits or ultimate outcome, may divert management's attention from the operation of our business. Our business will suffer if we do not retain our senior management and key employees or if we do not attract and retain other highly skilled employees Our future success depends significantly on the full involvement of our senior management and key employees, who have valuable expertise in all areas of our business. Our ability to retain and motivate our senior management and key employees and attract highly skilled employees will significantly affect our ability to run our business successfully and to expand our operations in the future. If we were to lose one or more of our senior management or, for example, valuable local managers with significant experience in the markets in which we operate, we might encounter difficulty in appointing replacements. This could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 29 Table of Contents The analysis of whether IFRIC 12 applies to certain contracts and activities, and the determination of the proper accounting treatment at each period end if it is determined that IFRIC 12 is to be applied, involves various complex factors and is significantly affected by legal and accounting interpretations We account for certain of our Concession-Type Infrastructure assets as service concession agreements in accordance with the provisions of IFRIC 12. The infrastructures accounted for by us as service concessions under IFRIC 12 are mainly related to the activities concerning power transmission lines, desalination plants and thermo-solar electricity generation plants outside of Spain and (with prospective application from January 1, 2011) in Spain. The analysis of whether IFRIC 12 applies to certain contracts and activities involves various complex factors and it is significantly affected by legal interpretation of certain contractual agreements or other terms and conditions with public sector entities. In particular, the application of IFRIC 12 requires a determination that the grantor of the concession governs what services the operator must provide using the infrastructure, to whom and at what price and also controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement. When the operator of the infrastructure is also responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction of such asset, IFRIC 12 requires the separate accounting for the revenue and margins associated with the construction activities, which is not eliminated in consolidation even between companies within the same consolidated group, and for the subsequent operation and maintenance of the infrastructure. In such cases, the investment in the infrastructure used in the concession arrangement cannot be classified as property, plant and equipment of the operator, but rather must be classified as a financial asset or an intangible asset, depending on the nature of the payment rights established under the contract. Therefore, the application of IFRIC 12 requires extensive judgment in relation to, among other factors, (i) the identification of certain infrastructures and contractual agreements in the scope of IFRIC 12, (ii) the understanding of the nature of the payments in order to determine the classification of the infrastructure as a financial asset or as an intangible asset and (iii) the timing and recognition of the revenue from construction and concessionary activity. Changes in one or more of the factors described above may significantly affect our conclusions as to the appropriateness of the application of IFRIC 12 and, therefore, our results of operations or our financial position. As a result, if we determined that those assets were no longer within the scope of IFRIC 12, the revenue and associated margins realized by us during the construction phase of the affected assets would no longer be recognized in accordance with IFRIC 12 but rather would be eliminated in consolidation, resulting in a decrease in revenue and profits in our consolidated income statement for the period reported, and a reclassification from intangible assets to property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. As such, a determination that those assets ceased to be within the scope of IFRIC 12 would affect the comparability of our results of operations and our financial condition for the periods, and as of the dates, before and after the date on which we made that determination. For more information about the application of IFRIC 12, see "Item 5.A. Operating ResultsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesRevenue from construction contracts" and "Note 2.5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect our business or financial position As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the "EFSF") and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the "EFSM") to provide funding to Eurozone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Throughout 2011, the EFSF and EFSM undertook a series of interventions to provide direct financing or other credit support to European governments. In March 2011, the European Council 30 Table of Contents agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, which will be activated by mutual agreement, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Eurozone countries after June 2013. In July 2011, the European Council agreed to enlarge the EFSF capital guarantee from €440 billion to €780 billion, a decision which was ratified by all relevant national legislatures in October 2011. In October 2011, the European Council agreed to increase the ability of the EFSF to intervene in sovereign debt markets by granting it the ability to offer insurance to third parties purchasing Eurozone sovereign debt. Throughout 2012, certain Eurozone states announced austerity programs and other cost-cutting initiatives, and the EFSF was permitted to further expand its powers to provide direct loans to certain Eurozone financial institutions, including certain such institutions in Spain. Further, the ECB indicated its willingness to take further actions to support the euro if necessary. These measures and indications helped stabilize the euro through the end of 2012 and 2013. There can be no assurance that the recent market disruptions in Europe related to sovereign debt, including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions and the stability of the euro, will not reoccur, nor can there be any assurance that future assistance packages will be available or, even if provided, will be sufficient to stabilize any affected countries and markets in Europe or elsewhere. Uncertainty persists regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and regional governments and the solvency of certain European financial institutions and their respective ability to meet future financial obligations. The protracted adverse market conditions have created doubts as to the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. These and other concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Member States, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our business or our financial position, as a significant principal amount of our outstanding debt securities is denominated in euro. The recoverability of our deferred tax assets depends on our future taxable income, which depends on management estimates that are uncertain Our management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets on the basis of estimates of future taxable profit. These estimates are derived from the projections included in our five- and ten-year strategic plans, which are prepared on a yearly basis and reviewed twice a year for the accuracy of the assumptions used. As of December 31, 2013, a significant portion of our deferred tax assets are tax credits, which include mostly tax loss carryforwards in Brazil, the United States, the Netherlands and Spain and tax credits relating to tax incentives principally generated in Spain from our investments in R&D&i and export activities, whose recoverability depends mostly on our capacity to generate future taxable income in such countries. Based on our current estimates we expect to generate sufficient future taxable income to achieve the realization of our current tax credits and tax loss carryforwards, supported by our historical trend of business performance. However, our current and deferred income taxes may be impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as by special non-recurring items. Changes in the assumptions and estimates made by management may result in the de-recognition of these deferred tax assets on our balance sheet if we consider that it is not probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense in the consolidated income statement, although there would be no impact on cash flows. 31 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Engineering and Construction Activity Our current and future fixed-price contracts may result in significant losses if costs are greater than anticipated Many of our EPC contracts are fixed-price contracts which contain inherent risks because we agree to the selling price of the project at the time we enter into the contract. The selling price is based on estimates of the ultimate cost of the contract and we assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing the project, as well as the post-completion warranty obligations. Most EPC contracts are fixed-price turnkey projects where we are responsible for all aspects of the work, from engineering through construction, as well as commissioning, all for a fixed selling price. In addition, we assume a project's technical risk and associated warranty obligations on all of our projects, meaning that we must tailor products and systems to satisfy the technical requirements of a project even though, at the time the project is awarded, we may not have previously produced such a product or system. Warranty obligations can range from re-performance of engineering services to modification or replacement of equipment. We also assume the risks related to revenue, cost and gross profit realized on such contracts that can vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to changes in a variety of other factors, including but not limited to: engineering design changes; unanticipated technical problems with the equipment being supplied or developed by us, which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem; changes in the cost of components, materials or labor; difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals; changes in local laws and regulations; changes in local labor conditions; project modifications creating unanticipated costs; delays caused by adverse weather conditions; and project owners', suppliers' or subcontractors' failure to perform. These risks may be exacerbated by the length of time between signing a contract and completing the project because most of the projects that we execute are long-term. In addition, we sometimes bear the risk of delays caused by unexpected conditions or events. We may be subject to penalties if portions of the long-term, fixed-priced projects are not completed in accordance with agreed-upon time limits. Failure by us to successfully defend against claims made against us by customers, suppliers or subcontractors, or failure by us to recover adequately on claims made against customers, suppliers or subcontractors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations Our projects generally involve complex engineering, procurement of supplies and construction management. We may encounter difficulties in the engineering, equipment delivery, schedule changes and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, that affect our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule or to meet the contractual performance obligations. In addition, we rely on third-party partners, equipment manufacturers and subcontractors to assist us with the completion of our contracts. As such, claims involving customers, suppliers and subcontractors may be brought against us, and by us, in connection with our project contracts. Claims brought against us include back charges for alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of the project and claims for cancelled projects. The claims and back charges can involve actual damages, as well as 32 Table of Contents contractually agreed upon liquidated sums. Claims brought by us against customers include claims for additional costs incurred in excess of current contract provisions arising out of project delays and changes in the previously agreed scope of work. Claims between us and our suppliers, subcontractors and vendors include claims like any of those described above. These project claims, if not resolved through negotiation, are often subject to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings. Charges associated with claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The performance of our Engineering and Construction activity is substantially dependent on the growth of our Concession-Type Infrastructures activity Our Engineering and Construction activity is our largest activity by revenue. A significant component of the revenue of our Engineering and Construction activity relates to works on owned assets and the construction of new infrastructure assets used in the Concession-Type Infrastructures activity, primarily power plants, power transmission lines and water infrastructure. As a result, revenue and profits from our Engineering and Construction activity are substantially dependent on global demand for new power plants, power transmission lines and water infrastructure, and the ability of our Concession-Type Infrastructures activity to win concession-type arrangements associated with such infrastructure. If we are unsuccessful in growing our Concession-Type Infrastructures activity and obtaining new concession-type arrangements, whether due to reductions in capital expenditures we plan to make on owned assets over the next several years following significant expenditures in recent years, declines in global demand for new power plants, power transmission lines and water infrastructure or otherwise, revenue and profits from our Engineering and Construction activity will decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The nature of our Engineering and Construction activity exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits Our Engineering and Construction activity engages in operations where failures in design, construction or systems can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties. In addition, the nature of our Engineering and Construction activity results in customers, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of cost they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been, and may in the future, be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. These claims generally arise in the normal course of our business. When it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the financial amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Risks Related to the Concession-Type Infrastructures Activity Development, construction and operation of new projects may be adversely affected by factors commonly associated with such projects The development, construction and operation of conventional power plants, renewable energy facilities, water infrastructure plants, power transmission lines and a number of our other projects can be time-consuming and highly complex. In connection with their development and financing, we must generally obtain government permits and approvals and sufficient financing, as well as enter into land purchase or leasing agreements, equipment procurement and construction contracts, operation and maintenance agreements, fuel supply and transportation agreements and any off-take arrangements. Factors that may affect our ability to construct new projects include, among others: delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, including environmental permits; shortages or changes in the price of equipment, materials or labor and related budget overruns; 33 Table of Contents adverse changes in the political and/or regulatory environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, accidents or other unforeseen events; and the inability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Any of these factors may cause delays in commencement or completion of our projects and may increase the cost of projects. If we are unable to complete contemplated projects, the costs incurred in connection with such projects may not be recoverable, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The concession agreements under which we conduct some of our operations are subject to revocation or termination Certain of our operations are conducted pursuant to concessions granted by various governmental bodies. Generally, these concessions give us rights to provide services for a limited period of time, subject to various governmental regulations. The governmental bodies responsible for regulating these services often have broad powers to monitor our compliance with the applicable concession contracts and can require us to supply them with technical, administrative and financial information. Among other obligations, we may be required to comply with investment commitments and efficiency and safety standards established in the concession. Such commitments and standards may be amended in certain cases by the governmental bodies. Our failure to comply with the concession agreements or other regulatory requirements may result in concessions not being granted, upheld or renewed in our favor, or, if granted, upheld or renewed, may not be done on as favorable terms as currently applicable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see "Item 5.AOperating ResultsFactors Affecting our Results of OperationsBacklog and Concessions". Revenue from our Concession-Type Infrastructures activity is significantly dependent on regulated tariffs or other long-term fixed rate arrangements that restrict our ability to increase revenue from these operations The revenue that we generate from our Concession-Type Infrastructures activity is significantly dependent on regulated tariffs or other long-term fixed rate arrangements. Under most of our concession agreements, a tariff structure is established in such agreements, and we have limited, or no possibility to independently raise tariffs beyond the established rates. Similarly, under a long-term power purchase agreement, we are required to deliver power at a fixed rate for the contract period, with limited escalation rights. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our tariffs or rates as a result of fluctuations in prices of raw materials, exchange rates, labor and subcontractor costs during the construction phase and the operating phase of these projects, or any other variations in the conditions of specific jurisdictions in which our concession-type infrastructure projects are located, which may reduce our revenue. Moreover, in some cases, if we fail to comply with certain pre-established conditions, the government or customer (as applicable) may reduce the tariffs or rates payable to us. In addition, during the life of a concession, the relevant government authority may unilaterally impose additional restrictions on our tariff rates, subject to the regulatory frameworks applicable in each jurisdiction. Governments may also postpone annual tariff increases until a new tariff structure is approved without compensating us for lost revenue. Furthermore, changes in laws and regulations may, in certain cases, have retroactive effect and expose us to additional compliance costs or interfere with our existing financial and business planning. In the case that any one or more of these events occur, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Our Water segment depends significantly on public spending on infrastructure-related water projects and services, and reduced government spending could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations During 2012 and 2013, the majority of the revenue from the Water segment of our Concession-Type Infrastructures activity was generated from contracts with governmental entities. Many of these public entities with which we do business are municipalities with limited budgets that are susceptible to annual fluctuations from year to year. The budgets of such municipalities are often dependent on the collection of local taxes or national government grants. As a result, resources that may be available to municipalities for infrastructure-related projects and services may become limited, with little or no notice. In addition, measures aimed at correcting the current economic environment have increased budget deficits of many of the national, regional and local governments and public administrations with which we do business, and no assurance can be given that funding for infrastructure-related projects and services will remain available at previous levels. Furthermore, the competition from competitors for publicly funded works has become increasingly intense, which may affect our margins in the future. Our dependence on public spending, coupled with increasing competition, may lead to reductions in our water concession revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Revenue from our power generation facilities is partially exposed to market electricity prices In addition to regulated incentives, revenue from certain of our projects partially depends on market prices for sales of electricity. Market prices may be volatile and are affected by various factors, including the cost of raw materials, user demand, and if applicable, the price of greenhouse gas emission rights. In several of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are exposed to remuneration schemes which contain both regulated incentive and market price components. In such jurisdictions, the regulated incentive component may not compensate for fluctuations in the market price component, and, consequently, total remuneration may be volatile. There can be no assurance that market prices will remain at levels which enable us to maintain profit margins and desired rates of return on investment. A decline in market prices below anticipated levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our solar projects will be negatively affected if there are adverse changes to national and international laws and policies that support renewable energy sources Recently, certain countries, such as the United States, a market that has become our principal market, have enacted policies of active support for renewable energy. These policies have included feed-in tariffs and renewable energy purchase obligations, mandatory quotas and/or portfolio standards imposed on utilities and certain tax incentives (such as the Investment Tax Credit in the United States). See "Item 4.BRegulation." Although support for renewable energy sources by governments and regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate has historically been strong, and European authorities, along with the United States government, have reaffirmed their intention to continue such support, certain policies currently in place may expire, be suspended or be phased out over time, cease upon exhaustion of the allocated funding or be subject to cancellation or non-renewal. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that such government support will be maintained in full, in part or at all. In Spain, after years of strong support, the Spanish government has adopted a series of measures (including measures with retroactive effect) that have significantly and adversely affected the prospects of renewable energy in Spain. See "Item 4.BRegulationSpainSolar Regulatory Framework." The United States Congress reduced funding for a loan guarantee program that benefits, among other energy-related projects, solar power generation. In addition, on March 1, 2013, due to the failure of the U.S. 35 Table of Contents Congress to enact a plan by February 28, 2013 to reduce the federal budget deficit by $1.2 trillion, $85 billion of automatic budget cuts (known as "sequestration") went into effect reducing discretionary spending by all agencies of the Federal government for the remainder of the Federal fiscal year ending September 30, 2013. These cuts affect, among others, the U.S. Treasury's program providing for cash grants in lieu of investment tax credits. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 was approved in December 2013. This budget agreement replaces $63 billion in sequester cuts over two years split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. See "Item 3.DRisk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business and the Markets in Which We OperateDecreases in government budgets, reductions in government subsidies and adverse changes in law may adversely affect our business and the development of existing and new projects." If the governments and regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate were to further decrease or abandon their support for development of solar energy due to, for example, competing funding priorities, political considerations or a desire to favor other energy sources, renewable or otherwise, the power plants we plan to develop in the future could become less profitable or cease to be economically viable. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Lack of power transmission capacity availability, potential upgrade costs to the power transmission grid, and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build photovoltaic ("PV") and CSP plants and generate solar electricity power sales In order to deliver electricity from our PV and CSP plants to our customers, our projects need to connect to the power transmission grid. The lack of available capacity on the power transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size, delays in project implementation, increases in costs from power transmission upgrades, and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project. These power transmission issues, as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear, could significantly impact our ability to build PV and CSP plants and generate solar electricity sales. Risks Related to Our Industrial Production Activity The ability of our Industrial Production activity to operate at a profit is largely dependent on managing the spread among the prices of inputs (grain, sugarcane, natural gas and others) and outputs (ethanol, sugar, DGS and others), the prices of which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty The results of the Biofuels segment of our Industrial Production activity are highly impacted by commodity prices, including the spread between the cost of inputs that we must purchase and the price of outputs that we sell. Prices and supplies are subject to, and determined by, market forces over which we have no control, such as weather, domestic and global demand, shortages, export prices, and various governmental policies in the United States, Europe, Brazil and around the world. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, the operating results of the Biofuels segment of our Industrial Production activity may fluctuate substantially. Increases in input or decreases in output prices may make it unprofitable to operate our plants. In the last quarter of 2011 and in 2012 and 2013, our Biofuels segment was adversely affected by rising raw materials costs of grains and sugar resulting from drought conditions in the United States and heavy rainfall in Brazil, respectively, as well as low gasoline demand that depressed ethanol prices. No assurance can be given that we will be able to purchase corn and natural gas at, or near, favorable prices and that we will be able to sell ethanol, sugar or distillers grains at, or near, favorable prices. Consequently, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by increases in the price of inputs or decreases in the price of outputs. 36 Table of Contents Our revenue may decrease, and operating costs may increase, if we do not effectively manage our exposure to commodity prices and supply risks through our hedging arrangements and other strategies We are exposed to fluctuations in the price and supply of commodities in the Biofuels segment of our Industrial Production activity. The Biofuels segment of our Industrial Production activity competes with the food market for the supply of grain, such as wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, and sugar. Consequently, any increases in the cost of grains increase our costs of ethanol production. We use hedging arrangements, including future sale and purchase contracts and options listed on organized markets, as well as over-the-counter contracts, to mitigate these risks. Such arrangements, however, do not fully eliminate our exposure to commodity prices and supply risk, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The price of ethanol from sugarcane is directly correlated to the price of sugar and is becoming closely positively correlated to the price of oil, so that a decline in the price of sugar will adversely affect our revenue from the sale of ethanol and a decline in the price of oil may adversely affect our revenue from the sale of ethanol The price of ethanol, generally, is closely associated with the price of sugar, and, to some degree, is increasingly correlated to the price of oil. A significant portion of our ethanol production in Brazil is produced at sugarcane mills that produce both ethanol and sugar. Because sugarcane millers are able to alter their product mix in response to the relative prices of ethanol and sugar, this results in the prices of both products being directly correlated, and the correlation between ethanol and sugar may increase over time. In addition, sugar prices in Brazil are determined by prices in the global market, so that there is a strong correlation between Brazilian ethanol prices and global sugar prices. Because flex-fuel vehicles allow consumers to choose between gasoline and ethanol at the fuel pump, ethanol prices are now becoming increasingly positively correlated to gasoline prices and, consequently, oil prices. We believe that the positive correlation between these products will increase over time. Accordingly, a decline in sugar prices will have an adverse effect on the financial performance of our ethanol and sugar businesses, and a decline in oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, biofuels are not the only alternative fuel for the transportation sector currently under development in the market. Future demand for fuel will depend on the relative attractiveness of other technologies, such as electric vehicles, synthetic fuels and other fossil fuels such as methane or liquid petroleum gas. Certain of these technological initiatives receive public support from governments. If biofuels do not remain an attractive alternative fuel competitive with gasoline and other emerging technologies, such occurrence may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party distribution agreements for our products which we may not be able to maintain We currently have several long-term contracts for the distribution of ethanol and biodiesel for a number of our plants. If these long-term contracts were not renewed, or were renewed on terms less favorable to us, it may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Biofuels segment of our Industrial Production activity may be adversely affected due to a change in the public opinion regarding the use of grain and sugar for the production of ethanol We may face adverse public opinion to the use of grain and sugar for the production of ethanol. Governments responding to public pressure may put in place measures to divert the supply of grain and sugar away from ethanol production and towards the food market, thereby inhibiting our current ethanol production activities or our plans for future expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 37 Table of Contents Our revenue from the Biofuels segment of our Industrial Production activity may be affected by adverse weather conditions, disease, government programs, competition, government regulation and various factors beyond our control Adverse weather conditions, disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition and changes in global demand are factors that have historically caused damage to, and affected related prices in, grain and sugar cane crops, reducing our pool of supply for ethanol production, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, government regulation of biofuels, including the elimination of existing subsidies for biofuels in some of the markets in which we operate, may have the result of changing consumer preferences or the prices by which we produce and market such biofuels. Our Industrial Production activity is subject to an increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations and environmental legislation Our Industrial Production activity is subject to an increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations. Among other things, these laws and regulations impose comprehensive local, state, municipal, foreign and supranational statutory and regulatory requirements concerning, among other matters, the treatment, acceptance, identification, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of industrial by-products, hazardous and solid waste materials, air emissions and soil contamination. In addition, environmental liability in Brazil is strict and joint. As a result, we may be held liable for damages caused to the environment by third parties hired by us for waste disposal and other services. There can be no assurance that potential liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with environmental laws and regulations will not be imposed on us in the future or that such liabilities, expenditures, fines or penalties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We operate with a high amount of indebtedness and we may incur significant additional debt Our operations are capital intensive and we operate with a significant amount of indebtedness, which, as of December 31, 2013, totaled €11,975.4 million, of which €5,654.4 million was Gross Corporate Debt and €6,320.9 million was non-recourse financing. Additionally, we have additional corporate borrowing capacity of €581.0 million which we may incur without triggering a breach of our financial covenants. Moreover, as a result of our implementation of the new accounting standards set forth in IFRS 10, which came into effect on January 1, 2012, for purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have de-consolidated companies that do not fulfill the conditions of effective control of the interest during the construction phase in terms of decision making for their integration in our financial statements according to the equity method. However, it is expected that these projects will be fully consolidated again once they enter into operation and we gain control over them, with corresponding significant increases in our long-term non-recourse project financing, among others. Our indebtedness may increase, from time to time, in the future for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could: make it more difficult for us to successfully refinance upcoming maturities; make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt obligations; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D&i and other general corporate purposes; 38 Table of Contents restrict our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our shares and the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to us, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in our financing agreements; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the market in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. If operating cash flows and other resources (for example, any available debt or equity funding or the proceeds of asset sales or short-term financing lines) are not sufficient to repay obligations as they mature or fund liquidity needs, we may be forced to do one or more of the following: delay or reduce capital expenditures; forego business opportunities, including acquisitions; or restructure or refinance all, or a portion, of our debt on or before maturity, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and, therefore, on the ability of the obligors under that debt to perform their respective obligations in respect of our debt. If we were to fail to satisfy any of our debt service obligations or to breach any related financial or operating covenants, the holders of that debt could declare the full amount of the indebtedness to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on any assets pledged as collateral. Further, certain of our financing arrangements contain cross-default provisions such that a default under one particular financing arrangement could automatically trigger defaults under other financing arrangements. Such cross-default provisions could, therefore, magnify the effect of an individual default. As a result, any default under any indebtedness to which we are a party could result in a substantial loss to us or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries' ability to perform our and their respective obligations in respect of any of our debt obligations. Despite our significant current leverage, the terms of the indentures and other agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness will permit us and our subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. If we incur additional debt, the related risks we now face could intensify. Furthermore, we rely to a significant extent on short-term financing lines to finance our working capital requirements. If these lines are withdrawn, reduced or otherwise not available to us, we could be required to seek other sources of financing which could involve incurring substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, if available. If we are not able to replace any short-term financing lines with other sources of financing on a timely basis, or at all, this would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position. Our operating and financial flexibility may be reduced by restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries contain various negative and affirmative covenants, including the requirement to maintain certain specified financial ratios. Depending on the agreement, these covenants reduce our operating flexibility as they limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; make distributions, loans, and other types of restricted payments; liquidate or dissolve the applicable companies; enter into any spin-off, transformation, merger, or acquisition, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the applicable agreement; and change the nature or scope of the lines of business. The extent of the restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to transfer assets to us through loans, advances or cash 39 Table of Contents dividends without the consent of third parties is significant, requiring us to include condensed financial information regarding Abengoa, S.A. as part of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, some of our subsidiaries have restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing project-level financing, or restrictions applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, such as exchange controls or similar matters. Our project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions to us unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of financial ratios. If we or any of our applicable subsidiaries violate any of these covenants, a default may result, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt and could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. We have generated significant negative cash outflows in the last three fiscal years and our liabilities at the end of each of those years have exceeded our tangible assets. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. As a result of the investments we have made in our activities in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, which totaled €2,257.1 million, €2,731.5 million and €2,912.9 million, respectively, in capital expenditures, we have generated a significant amount of negative cash outflows during each of those periods, and our liabilities at each respective period end have exceeded our tangible assets. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures and R&D&i initiatives will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. In addition, a substantial part of the non-recourse financing of our project companies is fully amortized over the term of such debt, and we rely on cash flows from such operating companies to meet our payment obligations thereunder. Our cash flow, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least twelve months. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; that ongoing cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule; that we will be able to maintain the same terms for our payments and collections and therefore maintain our negative working capital balance; or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs or to enable us to pursue our uncommitted capital expenditure plan (see "Item 5.BLiquidity and Capital Resources"). We may need to refinance all, or a portion, of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under certain of our credit facilities in the event of a change of control if so required by a majority of the lenders or a change of control offer required by the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities Under the terms of certain of our credit facilities, the majority of the lenders (as defined in each such facility) under each such facility have the right to require early repayment of all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued interest and all accrued commissions and expenses, upon a person or entity other than our current controlling shareholder gaining control of us. Under the terms of our outstanding debt securities, we are required to offer to repurchase such debt securities if we experience a change of control as defined in the indentures governing such debt securities. We may be unable to raise sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make such mandatory repayment of all outstanding borrowings under those credit facilities or repurchase such debt securities. 40 Table of Contents Existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates pursuant to non-recourse indebtedness could adversely affect us We attempt to finance certain of our projects and significant investments, including capital expenditures typically relating to concessions or fixed tariff take-or-pay agreements, primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the revenue of the project being financed thereby, and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the shares, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project company. This type of financing is usually referred to herein as "non-recourse debt", "non-recourse financing" or "project financing." As of December 31, 2013, we had €11,975.4 million indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis, of which €6,320.9 million was non-recourse debt. While the lenders under our non-recourse project financings do not have direct recourse to us or our subsidiaries (other than the project borrowers under those financing), defaults by the project borrowers under such financings can still have important consequences for us and our subsidiaries, including, without limitation: reducing our receipt of dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash, since the project company will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to us and our subsidiaries during the pendency of any default; causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets of the project company; and the loss or impairment of investors' and project finance lenders' confidence in us. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Any future credit rating downgrade may impair our ability to obtain financing and may significantly increase our cost of indebtedness Credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain financing (or refinancing). Rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our default rate and existing capital markets debt are based on a number of factors, including the credit rating of the Kingdom of Spain, where we are incorporated. On April 26, 2012, Standard & Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") downgraded the debt of Spain from "A" to "BBB+", citing concerns related to the negative economic growth and the capital adequacy of certain Spanish financial institutions. This was followed by rating downgrades by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch") on November 1, 2013, which lowered Spain's rating from "A" to "BBB" with a stable outlook, and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") on June 13, 2012, which likewise lowered Spain's rating from "A3" to "Baa3." Moody's upgraded its rating to "Baa2" on February 24, 2014, with a positive outlook. S&P announced on October 10, 2012 that it had further lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating of the Kingdom of Spain to "BBB-" from "BBB+" and the short-term sovereign credit rating to A-3 from A-2, with a negative outlook on the long-term rating; the outlook was changed to stable on November 29, 2013. Partially as a result of the downgrade of Spain, where we are incorporated, on July 17, 2012, Moody's downgraded our corporate family rating and probability of default rating from "Ba3" to "B1" with a stable outlook. Concurrently, Moody's downgraded the rating on certain of our existing high-yield notes from "Ba3" to "B1." On November 30, 2012 Moody's changed to negative from stable the outlook on the B1 rating of our corporate family and such high-yield notes and downgraded them on March 20, 2013 from B1 to B2 with a stable outlook. On December 27, 2012, S&P changed the perspective of the B+ rating from stable to watch negative of our corporate family and such high yield notes and S&P downgraded them on April 3, 2013 to "B" with negative outlook. In addition, on July 25, 2012, Fitch downgraded our long-term issuer default rating from "BB" to "B+" with a stable outlook. 41 Table of Contents Any future downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain, our corporate family or of our outstanding nonconvertible debt securities may impede our ability to obtain financing on commercially acceptable terms, or on any terms at all, or it may interfere with our ability to implement our corporate strategy. There can be no assurance that further credit ratings downgrades, either of Spain or our Group, will not occur. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Ownership of the ADSs and Class B shares The trading price of our ADSs and dividends paid on our ADSs may be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate for converting euros into U.S. dollars Market prices for our ADSs may fall if the value of euros declines against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar amount of cash dividends and other cash payments made to holders of our ADSs would be reduced if the value of euros declines against the U.S. dollar. Holders of our ADSs may not be able to exercise their voting rights due to delays in notification to and by the depositary The rights of shareholders under Spanish law to take actions such as voting their shares, receiving dividends and distributions, bringing derivative actions, examining our accounting books and records and exercising appraisal rights are available only to shareholders of record. Because the depositary, through its custodian, will be the record holder of the Class B shares underlying the ADSs, a holder of ADSs will not be entitled to the same rights as a shareholder. In its capacity as an ADS holder, an investor in the Company's ADSs will not able to vote, bring a derivative action, examine our accounting books and records or exercise appraisal rights, except through the depositary. The depositary for our ADSs may not receive voting materials for our Class B shares represented by our ADSs in time to ensure that holders of our ADSs can instruct the depositary to vote their shares. In addition, the depositary's liability to holders of our ADSs for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions is limited by the Deposit Agreement governing our ADR facility. As a result, holders of our ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to vote and may have limited recourse against the depositary or us, if their shares are not voted according to their request. Although holders or owners of ADSs who withdraw Class B shares from the depositary may vote those Class B shares directly, such holders or owners of the ADSs may not receive sufficient advance notice of shareholder meetings to enable them to withdraw the shares and vote at such meetings. Holders of our ADSs will have limited recourse if we or the depositary fail to meet our respective obligations under the Deposit Agreement The Deposit Agreement expressly limits our obligations and liability and those of the depositary. Neither we nor the depositary will be liable if either: is prevented from or delayed in performing any obligation by circumstances beyond our/their control; exercises or fails to exercise discretion under the Deposit Agreement; or takes any action based upon the advice of, or information from, legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting ordinary shares for deposit, any holder or owner of our ADSs or any other person believed by us or the depositary in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information. In addition, the depositary has the obligation to participate in any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to our ADSs which may involve it in expense or liability only if it is indemnified. These provisions of the Deposit Agreement will limit the ability of holders of our ADSs to obtain recourse if we or the depositary fails to meet their obligations under the Deposit Agreement or if they wish to involve us or the depositary in a legal proceeding. 42 Table of Contents Because Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A., as the direct and indirect holder of 60.50% of our Class A shares, controls the majority of the voting power of our outstanding share capital, other shareholders will be unable to affect the outcome of shareholder votes with respect to most events. Our Class A shares have 100 votes per share and our Class B shares have one vote per share. Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. beneficially owns, either directly or indirectly through Finarpisa, S.A., 50,699,906 of our Class A shares and 237,799,624 of our Class B shares and 58.18% of the total combined voting power of our Class A shares and Class B shares outstanding as of March 17, 2014. In the event that all holders of Class A shares other than Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. were to convert their Class A shares to Class B shares, Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. would as of March 17, 2014 hold 90.81% of the total combined voting power of our aggregate issued and outstanding Class A and Class B shares (subject to its agreement entered into on August 27, 2012 with us not to exercise voting rights in excess of 55.93% of the voting power in the Company unless its economic rights in us exceed such amount). Accordingly, Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. has and is expected to maintain the ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes with respect to most events that may require shareholder approval, including: mergers, consolidations and other business combinations; election or non-election of directors; removal of directors; and certain amendments to our Bylaws. As a result, Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. may be able to effectively approve or prevent a merger, consolidation or other business combination, elect or not elect directors, approve or prevent the removal of a director and approve or prevent amendments to our Bylaws. Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A.'s interests in any of these matters may be contrary to the interests of the rest of the holders of our Class B shares. On September 30, 2012, the Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting approved a modification of our Bylaws to enable the holders of Class B shares to enforce certain minority protection rights afforded by Spanish corporate laws to holders of shares representing specified percentages of a company's share capital, including among others the right to request the calling of an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, to add items to the agenda of any ordinary general shareholders meeting and to challenge resolutions passed by the board of directors. Notwithstanding this, holders of Class B shares will not, in practice, be able to appoint directors by virtue of the proportional representation mechanism (representación proporcional), which is only available to holders of at least 5% of our share capital. For more information regarding the shareholdings of Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A., see "Item 7.AMajor Shareholders." Our dual-class share structure with different voting rights could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class B shares and ADSs may view as beneficial We have two classes of voting shares. Holders of Class A shares are entitled to 100 votes per share, while holders of Class B shares are entitled to one vote per share. Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. beneficially owns, either directly or indirectly through Finarpisa, S.A., 50,699,906 of our Class A shares and 237,799,624 of our Class B shares and 58.18% of the total combined voting power of our Class A shares and Class B shares outstanding as of March 17, 2014 (subject to its agreement entered into on August 27, 2012 with us not to exercise voting rights in excess of 55.93% of the voting power in the Company unless its economic rights in us exceed such amount). Due to the disparate voting rights attached to our Class A and Class B shares, holders of our Class A shares and, in particular, Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. will have significant voting power over matters 43 Table of Contents requiring shareholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or our assets. Because this concentrated control could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that holders of Class B shares and ADSs may view as beneficial, the market price of our Class B shares and ADSs could be adversely affected. In addition, holders of ADSs and Class B shares may not have the same protections as the Class A shares in the event of a takeover bid by a third-party offeror for all of the outstanding voting shares of Abengoa. Under Spanish tender offer legislation, it is not clear whether in such event the offeror would be obligated to offer to holders of Class B shares the same price per share that it offers to holders of our Class A shares. Our Bylaws provide holders of Class B shares with the right to have their shares redeemed under certain circumstances for consideration equal to the price per share offered to holders of the Class A shares in a takeover bid launched for 100% of the voting shares not providing the same treatment for holders of Class A shares and of Class B shares. Because the inclusion of such redemption right in our Bylaws may discourage others from pursuing a voluntary takeover bid that holders of our Class B shares and ADSs may view as beneficial, the market price of our Class B shares and ADSs could be adversely affected. While our Class B shares and ADSs have similar economic rights to our Class A shares, they may trade at different prices from our Class A shares While our Class B shares have different voting rights from our Class A shares, the two classes of shares are similar in terms of the economic rights that attach to them. In particular, each Class B share grants its holder, among other things, the rights to receive the same dividend, the same payment on liquidation, the same restitution of contributions in the event of any capital reduction, the same distribution of reserves of any kind or of the issue premium and any other allocations as the Class A shares. Moreover, in the event of any capital increase, holders of the Class A shares and Class B shares are both entitled to preemptive subscription rights allowing them, upon exercise of such rights, to maintain their respective percentage ownership interest in the share capital of Abengoa. Despite having similar economic rights, however, the Class A shares and the Class B shares have traded in the past at different prices from each other. We cannot provide you with any assurance that the trading price of the Class B shares and ADSs will be correlated with the trading price of the Class A shares in the future. Holders of our ADSs in the United States may not be able to participate in offerings of rights, warrants or similar securities to holders of our ordinary shares on the same terms and conditions as holders of our ordinary shares In the event that we offer rights, warrants or similar securities to the holders of our ordinary shares or distribute dividends payable, in whole or in part, in securities, the Deposit Agreement provides that the depositary (after consultation with us) shall have discretion as to the procedure to be followed in making such rights or other securities available to ADS holders including disposing of such rights or other securities and distributing the net proceeds in U.S. dollars to ADS holders. We generally would be required to register with the SEC any public offering of rights, warrants or other securities made to our ADS holders unless an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. securities laws is available. Registering such an offering with the SEC can be a lengthy process which may be inconsistent with the timetable for a global capital raising operation. Consequently, we may in the future elect not to make such an offer in the United States, including to our ADS holders in the United States and rather only conduct such an offering in an "offshore" transaction in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act, as amended. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our ADS holders will be able to participate in such an offering in the same manner as our ordinary shareholders. In such event, the percentage ownership interest and voting power of the Class B shareholders would decline relative to the percentage ownership interest and voting power of the Class A shareholders and, in particular, Inversión Corporativa IC, S.A. 44 Table of Contents As a "foreign private issuer" in the United States, we are exempt from certain rules under the U.S. securities laws and are permitted to file less information with the SEC than U.S. companies As a "foreign private issuer," we are exempt from certain rules under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that impose certain disclosure obligations and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. In addition, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and "short-swing" profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of our ordinary shares and ADSs. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required to comply with Regulation FD, which restricts the selective disclosure of material information. Although we must comply with Spanish listing rules on insider reporting of share ownership and on protection of inside information, there may be less publicly available information concerning us than there is for U.S. public companies. Judgments of U.S. courts may not be enforceable against us Judgment of U.S. courts, including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the U.S. may not be enforceable in courts in Spain. As a result, our shareholders who obtain a judgment against us in the U.S. may not be able to require us to pay the amount of the judgment. There are limitations on enforceability of civil liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws We are a Spanish company. Most of our officers and directors are residents of Spain and not the United States. It may be difficult or impossible to serve legal process on persons located outside the United States and to force them to appear in a U.S. court. It may also be difficult or impossible to enforce a judgment of a U.S. court against persons outside the United States, or to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against such persons in the United States. We believe that there may be doubt as to the enforceability against persons in Spain, whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the laws of the United States, including its federal securities laws. Because we are a foreign private issuer, our directors and officers will not be subject to rules under the Exchange Act that under certain circumstances would require directors and officers to forfeit to us any "short-swing" profits realized from purchases and sales, as determined under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, of our equity securities. However, under Spanish listing rules, our directors must not deal in any of our securities on considerations of a short-term nature. Individual shareholders of a Spanish company (including U.S. persons) have the right under Spanish law to bring lawsuits on behalf of the company in which they are a shareholder, and on their own behalf against the company, in certain limited circumstances. Spanish law does not permit class action lawsuits by shareholders, except in limited circumstances. Future sales of the Class B shares and/or the ADSs and/or equity related securities in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of the Class B shares and the ADSs and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings Future sales of substantial amounts of the Class B shares and/or the ADSs and/or equity-related securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of the Class B shares and the ADSs and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of the Class B shares and/or the ADSs or the availability of the Class B shares and/or the ADSs and/or equity related securities for future sale will have on the trading price of the Class B shares and the ADSs. 45 Table of Contents The price of the Class B shares and the ADSs could be depressed by investors' anticipation of the potential sale in the market of substantial additional amounts of Class B shares and ADSs. Disposals of the Class B shares and/or the ADSs would increase their offer in the market and depress their price. The trading market for securities such as the Class B shares and the ADSs may be volatile and may be adversely impacted by many events The market for securities issued by issuers such as us, such as the Class B shares and the ADSs, is influenced by economic and market conditions and, to varying degrees, market conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation rates in other European and other industrialized countries. There can be no assurance that events in Spain, Europe, the United States or elsewhere will not cause market volatility or that such volatility will not adversely affect the price of the Class B shares or the ADSs or that economic and market conditions will not have any other adverse effect. Fluctuations in interest rates may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative value of the Class B shares or the ADSs. Any trading by arbitrageurs could, in turn, affect the trading prices of the Class B shares or ADSs.
