ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are risks related to our business: OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO VARY. WE RECOGNIZED LOSSES FOR THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS. We incurred a loss of approximately $1.5 million for fiscal 2007, a loss of approximately $1 million for fiscal 2006, and a loss of approximately $1.4 million for fiscal 2005. Our net losses may continue and our ability to sustain profitability will be impacted by: o the short-term nature of client's commitments because of shorter-term projects rather than long-term contracts o patterns of capital spending by clients, as the industry continues to experience a sluggish IT spending environment o pricing changes in response to competitive factors, often driving prices and profit margins down o timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings o trends in IT outsourcing, as clients reduce the number of vendors o the availability and related costs of attracting and retaining qualified sales and technical personnel o general economic conditions 6 FAILURE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THE MARKETPLACE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. We operate in an intensely competitive industry. We compete with small boutique IT firms as well as large, global companies, including manufacturers who now compete against us to sell directly to the customer. Although we feel we offer our clients a wide range of highly sophisticated professional services in conjunction with a select product line, increased competition may create greater pressure to further reduce prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. We rely upon our ability to find, attract, and retain qualified sales and technical personnel. At present, there is a shortage of qualified personnel and we are in direct competition for these applicants with larger businesses to hire from this limited pool of qualified applicants. WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUE FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CLIENTS. IF WE WERE TO LOSE ONE OR MORE OF THESE CLIENTS, AND THE BUSINESS WERE NOT REPLACED, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. While only one customer currently accounts for 10% or more of our revenues, our top ten clients account for a significant amount of our business. Although we anticipate our business to continue with these clients, the loss of any large client could have an adverse impact on our Corporation's results of operations if that revenue stream was not replaced from alternative sources. WE MUST MAINTAIN AUTHORIZATIONS FROM MAJOR MANUFACTURERS TO OPERATE A SAN AUTHORIZED RESELLER AND/OR SERVICE PROVIDER TO PROVIDE THE RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURER'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. We must maintain our authorized status as an authorized reseller or authorized service provider in order to market the products of most major manufacturers. Such authorizations are conditioned upon our continued ability to meet specified requirements, usually related to technical skill levels of our personnel. Although we do not forsee any problem in maintaining our authorizations or obtaining future authorizations, without these authorizations or suitable replacements, we would not be able to offer our clients the products we currently market.
