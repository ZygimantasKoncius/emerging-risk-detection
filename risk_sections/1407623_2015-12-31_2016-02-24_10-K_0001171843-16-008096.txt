risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All distributions will be made, subject to Maryland law (or Delaware law, in the case of distributions by the Operating Partnership), at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, its financial condition, any debt covenants, maintenance of its REIT qualification and other factors as its board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. The Company believes that a change in any one of the following factors could materially and adversely affect its income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay distributions to its securityholders: ·the profitability of the assets acquired; ·the Company’s ability to make profitable acquisitions; ·margin calls or other expenses that reduce the Company’s cash flow; ·defaults in the Company’s asset portfolio or decreases in the value of its portfolio; and ·the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. The Company cannot assure you that it will achieve results that will allow it to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions in the future. In addition, some of the Company’s distributions may include a return of capital. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
