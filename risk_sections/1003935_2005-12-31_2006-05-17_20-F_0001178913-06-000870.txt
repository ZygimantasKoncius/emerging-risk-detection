Risk Factors General Business Risks Relating to Our Business Portfolio and Structure The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological changes and frequent new products and service introductions. We may not be able to keep up with these rapid technological and other changes. We are operating in several markets, each characterized by rapidly changing technology, new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable and can exert price pressures on existing products. We anticipate that a number of existing and potential competitors will be introducing new and enhanced products that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. Our most significant market is the market for voice recording platforms and related enhanced applications (or Voice Platforms and Applications). Voice Platforms and Applications are utilized by entities operating in the contact center, trading floor, public safety and air traffic control segments to capture, store, retrieve and analyze recorded data. The market for our Voice Platforms and Applications is, in particular, characterized by a group of highly competitive vendors that are introducing rapidly changing competitive offerings around evolving industry standards. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to successfully develop and introduce new, enhanced and competitive products, on a timely basis, in all the markets where we operate, will be a critical factor in our ability to grow and be competitive. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant expenditures on research and development, particularly with respect to new software applications, which are continuously required in all our business areas. The convergence of voice and data networks and wired and wireless communications could require substantial modification and customization of our current products and business models, as well as the introduction of new products. Further, customer acceptance of these new technologies may be slower than we anticipate. We cannot assure you that the market or demand for our products will grow as rapidly as we expect, or if at all, that we will successfully develop new products or introduce new applications for existing products, that such new products and applications will achieve market acceptance or that the introduction of new products or technological developments by others will not render our products obsolete. In addition, our products must readily integrate with major third party security, telephone, front-office and back-office systems. Any changes to these third party systems could require us to redesign our products, and any such redesign might not be possible on a timely basis or achieve market acceptance. Our inability to develop products that are competitive in technology and price and responsive to customer needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations include industry specific factors; our ability to continuously develop, introduce and deliver commercially viable products, solutions and technologies, the markets rate of acceptance of the product solutions and technologies we offer; and our ability to keep pace with market and technology changes and to compete successfully. 4 Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments. In particular, we may not succeed in making additional acquisitions or be effective in integrating such acquisitions. As part of our growth strategy, we have made a number of acquisitions and have made minority investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies. We frequently evaluate the tactical or strategic opportunity available related to complementary businesses, products or technologies. The process of integrating an acquired companys business into our operations and/or of investing in new technologies, may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. Other risks commonly encountered with acquisitions include the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation, the failure of the acquired business to further our strategies, the inability to successfully integrate or commercialize acquired technologies or otherwise realize anticipated synergies or economies of scale on a timely basis and the potential impairment of acquired assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment will be realized. Future acquisitions or investments contemplated and/or consummated could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions or effective in integrating such acquisitions into our existing business. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration consists, in whole or in part, of ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares (ADSs), representing our ordinary shares, shareholders would suffer dilution of their interests in us. We have also invested in companies which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire initial investment in these companies. 5 We have expanded into new markets and may not be able to manage our expansion and anticipated growth effectively. We have established a sales and service infrastructure in India by recruiting sales and service personnel in order to bring about further growth in revenue in the Asia Pacific market and have expanded our professional services group to include business consultants. Also, since 2002 we have been expanding our presence in Europe (mainly in the United Kingdom) and in the Middle East and Africa (the EMEA region) through organic growth and through our acquisition of Thales Contact Solutions (or TCS). The growth in our business in the EMEA region is still in its early stage, and in particular, we are just beginning to develop our digital video business in the EMEA region. We expect continued growth, particularly in connection with the enhancement and expansion of our operations in the EMEA region, as well as in the Asia Pacific region. We may establish additional operations within these regions or in other regions where growth opportunities are projected to warrant the investment. However, we cannot assure you that our revenues will increase as a result of this expansion or that we will be able to recover the expenses we incurred in effecting the expansion. Our failure to effectively manage our expansion of our sales, marketing, service and support organizations could have a negative impact on our business. To accommodate our global expansion, we are continuously implementing new or expanded business systems, procedures and controls. There can be no assurance that the implementation of such systems, procedures, controls and other internal systems can be completed successfully. Our evolving business strategy could adversely affect our business. Historically we have supplied the hardware and some software for implementing multimedia recording solutions. Our shift towards providing professional support services and an enterprise software business model has required and will continue to require substantial change, potentially resulting in some disruption to our business. These changes may include changes in management and technical personnel; expanded or differing competition resulting from entering the enterprise software market; increased need to expand our distribution network to include system integrators which could impact revenues and gross margins, and, as our applications are sold either to our installed base or to new customers together with our recording platforms, the rate of adoption of our software applications by the market. The changes in our business may place a significant strain on our operational and financial resources. We may experience substantial disruption from changes and could incur significant expenses and write-offs. Failing to carefully manage expense and inventory levels consistent with product demand and to carefully manage accounts receivable to limit credit risk, could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 6 We depend upon outsourcers for the manufacture of our key products. The failure of our product manufacturers to meet our quality or delivery requirements would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2002, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Flextronics Israel Ltd., a subsidiary of Flextronics, a global electronics manufacturing services company, or Flextronics. Under this agreement, Flextronics provides us with a comprehensive manufacturing solution that covers all aspects of the manufacture of our products from order receipt to product shipment, including purchasing, manufacturing, testing, configuration, and delivery services. This agreement covered all our products. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Dictaphone Corporations (or Dictaphone) Communications Recordings Systems division (or CRS), we assumed a contract manufacturing agreement with Dictaphones EMS (EMS) division pursuant to which EMS manufactures all ex-CRS products. As a result of these arrangements, we are now fully dependent on Flextronics and EMS to process orders and manufacture our products. Consequently, the manufacturing process of our products is not in our control. We may from time to time experience delivery delays due to the inability of Flextronics and EMS to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements and we may experience production interruptions if any of Flextronics or EMS is for any reason unable to continue the production of our products. Should we have on-going performance issues with our contract manufacturers, the process to move from one contractor to another is a lengthy and costly process that could affect our ability to execute customer shipment requirements and/or might negatively affect revenue and/or costs. If these manufacturers or any other manufacturer were to cancel contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results. If flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair, replacement or service costs and potential liability and damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 7 If we lose our key suppliers, our business may suffer. Certain components and subassemblies that are used in the manufacture of our existing products are purchased from a single or a limited number of suppliers. In the event that any of these suppliers are unable to meet our requirements in a timely manner, we may experience an interruption in production until an alternative source of supply can be obtained. Any disruption, or any other interruption of a suppliers ability to provide components to us, could result in delays in making product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our major suppliers use proprietary technology and software code that could require significant redesign of our products in the case of a change in vendor. Further, as suppliers discontinue their products, or modify them in manners incompatible with our current use, or use manufacturing processes and tools that could not be easily migrated to other vendors, we could have significant delays in product availability, which would have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we generally maintain an inventory for some of our components and subassemblies to limit the potential for an interruption and we believe that we can obtain alternative sources of supply in the event our suppliers are unable to meet our requirements in a timely manner, we cannot assure you that our inventory and alternative sources of supply would be sufficient to avoid a material interruption or delay in production and in availability of spare parts. The European Union has issued directives relating to the sale in member countries of electrical and electronic equipment, including products sold by us. If our products fail to comply with these directives, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions that could materially adversely affect our business. A directive issued by the European Union on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or RoHS, comes into effect on July 1, 2006. The RoHS directive lists a number of substances including, among others, lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium, which must either be removed or reduced to within maximum permitted concentrations in any products containing electrical or electronic components that are sold within the European Union. Our products fall within the scope of the RoHS directive and we are making every effort in order to ensure that all of our products sold in the European Union after July 1, 2006, will comply with the RoHS directive, without otherwise adversely affecting the quality and functionalities of such products. We, alongside other manufacturers, will be dependent on our suppliers for certain components and sub-system modules to comply with these requirements. Compliance with the RoHS directive, especially with respect to the requirement that products be lead free, will require us to undertake significant expenses with respect to the redesign of our products. In addition, we may be required to pay higher prices for components that comply with this directive. We may not be able to pass these higher component costs or redesign costs on to our customers. We cannot at this point estimate the expense that will be required to redesign our products in order to include environmentally friendly components. We cannot be sure that we will be able to comply with these regulations in a timely manner, that we will be able to comply on a cost effective basis or that a sufficient supply of compliant components will be available to us. Our inability or failure to comply with these regulations may restrict us for a period of time from conducting certain business in the European Union and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, manufacturers of components that we use in our products that do not comply with these regulations may decide to stop manufacturing these components prior to the July 2006 compliance date. These actions by manufacturers of components could result in a shortage of components that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 8 A further directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or WEEE, approved by the European Union in 2003, promotes waste recovery with a view to reducing the quantity of waste for disposal and saving natural resources, in particular by reuse, recycling and recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment. The WEEE directive covers all electrical and electronic equipment used by consumers and electronic equipment intended for professional use. The directive, which partly came into effect in August 2005, requires that all new electrical and electronic equipment placed for sale in the European Union be appropriately labeled regarding waste disposal and contains other obligations regarding the collection and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Our products fall within the scope of the WEEE directive, and we are taking and will continue to take all requisite steps to ensure compliance. The WEEE directive is required to be implemented by each member country of the European Union through its own national legislation. Accordingly, we cannot at this time be certain that we will be able to comply with the specific regulations which will be enacted to implement the WEEE directive in each of the individual countries in the European Union. The countries of the European Union, as a single market for our products, accounted in 2005 for approximately 23% of our revenues. If our products fail to comply with WEEE or RoHS directives or any other directive issued from time to time by the European Union, we could be subject to penalties and other sanctions that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we lose a major customer or support contract, our business may suffer. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from services, which include maintenance, project management, support and training. As a result, if we lose a major customer or if a support contract is delayed or cancelled, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, customers who have accounted for significant services revenues in the past may not generate revenues in future periods. Our failure to obtain new customers or additional orders from existing customers could also materially affect our results of operations. Risks associated with our distribution channels and key strategic partners may materially adversely affect our financial results. We have agreements in place with many distributors, dealers and resellers to market and sell our products and services in addition to our direct sales force. We derive a significant percentage of our revenues from one of our distributor channels and new channels may, in the future, account for a significant percentage of our revenues. Our top channel partner accounted for approximately 21%, 19% and 20% of our revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated, if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken. Additionally, our competitors ability to penetrate our strategic relationships, particularly our relationship with Avaya Inc., our largest global distribution partner and one of the leading global providers of enterprise business communication platforms in voice, e-business and data, may result in a significant reduction of sales through that partner. 9 As our market opportunities change, our reliance on particular channel partners may increase, which may negatively impact gross margins. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and market share. In addition, some of our channel partners are suppliers of telecommunication infrastructure equipment. There can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop or market VoIP, software applications and storage products and services in competition with us in the future. Our uneven sales patterns could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and earnings. The sales cycle for our products and services is variable, typically ranging between a few weeks to several months from initial contact with the potential client to the signing of a contract. Frequently, sales orders accumulate towards the latter part of a given quarter. Looking forward, given the lead-time required by our contract manufacturer, if a large portion of sales orders are received late in the quarter, we may not be able to deliver products within the quarter and thus such sales will be deferred to a future quarter. There can be no assurance that such deferrals will result in sales in the near term, or at all. Thus, delays in executing client orders may affect our revenue and cause our operating results to vary widely. Additionally, as a high percentage of our expenses, particularly employee compensation, is relatively fixed, a variation in the level of sales, especially at or near the end of any quarter, may have a material adverse impact on our quarterly operating results. It is also difficult to predict the exact mix of products for any period between hardware, software and services as well as within the product category between audio platforms and related applications and digital video. As each of our product types and services have different gross margins, changes in the mix of products in a period will have an impact, and perhaps a material impact, on our gross profit and net income in that period. If we lose our key personnel or cannot recruit additional personnel, our business may suffer. If our growth continues, we will be required to hire and integrate new employees. Recruiting and retaining qualified engineers and computer programmers to perform research and development and to commercialize our products, as well as qualified personnel to market and sell those products, are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 26% of our employees were devoted to research and product development and 23% were devoted to marketing and sales. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit and integrate new employees. There is often intense competition to recruit highly skilled employees in the technology industry. We may also experience personnel changes as a result of our move from multimedia recording equipment towards business performance solutions. An inability to attract and retain highly qualified employees may have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new products and enhancements for existing products and to successfully market such products, all of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our success also depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of a number of key management, sales, marketing and development employees, the loss of any of whom could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 10 Operating internationally exposes us to additional and unpredictable risks. We sell our products throughout the world and intend to continue to increase our penetration of international markets. In 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, approximately 98%, 98%, 99%, 99% and 99%, respectively, of our total sales were derived from sales to customers outside of Israel, and approximately 48%, 52%, 50%, 44%, and 53%, respectively, of our total sales were made to customers in North America. A number of risks are inherent in international transactions. Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in exchange rates, general economic conditions, regulatory requirements, tax structures or changes in tax laws, and longer payment cycles in the countries in our geographic areas of operations. International sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by the imposition of governmental controls and regulations, export license requirements, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and difficulties in managing international operations. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inadequate intellectual property protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our intellectual property and we may be subject to liability in the event our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties and we are not successful in defending such claims. Our success is dependent, to a significant extent, upon our proprietary technology. We currently hold 29 U.S. patents and 20 patents issued in additional countries covering the same technology as the U.S. patents. We have over 128 patent applications pending in the United States and other countries. We currently rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, together with non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, as well as third party licenses to establish and protect the technology used in our systems. However, we cannot assure you that such measures will be adequate to protect our proprietary technology, that competitors will not develop products with features based upon, or otherwise similar to our systems, or that third party licenses will be available to us or that we will prevail in any proceeding instituted by us in order to enjoin competitors from selling similar products. Although we believe that our products do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that one or more third parties will not make a contrary claim or that we will be successful in defending such claim. 11 From time to time, we receive cease and desist letters alleging patent infringements. No formal claims or other actions have been filed with respect to such alleged infringements, except for claims filed by Dictaphone (which have since been settled and dismissed) and Witness Systems, Inc. (described under Item 8, Financial InformationLegal Proceedings in this annual report). We believe that none of these allegations has merit. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be successful in defending against the claims that have been asserted or any other claims that may be asserted. We also cannot assure you that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operations. Defending infringement claims or other claims could involve substantial costs and diversion of management resources. In addition, to the extent we are not successful in defending such claims, we may be subject to injunctions with respect to the use or sale of certain of our products or to liabilities for damages and may be required to obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms. We face potential product liability claims against us. Our products focus specifically on organizations business-critical operations. We may be subject to claims that our products are defective or that some function or malfunction of our products caused or contributed to property, bodily or consequential damages. We minimize this risk by incorporating provisions into our distribution and standard sales agreements that are designed to limit our exposure to potential claims of liability. We carry product liability insurance in the amount of $20,000,000 per occurrence and $20,000,000 overall per annum. No assurance can be given that all claims will be covered either by the contractual provisions limiting liability or by the insurance, or that the amount of any individual claim or all claims will be covered by the insurance or that the amount of any individual claim or all claims in the aggregate will not exceed policy coverage limits. A significant liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. If our advanced compliance recording solutions fail to record our customers interactions, we may be subject to liability and our reputation may be harmed. Many of our customers use our solutions to record and to store recordings of commercial interactions. These recordings are used to provide back-up and verification of transactions and to guard against risks posed by lost or misinterpreted voice communications. These customers rely on our solutions to record, store and retrieve voice data in a timely, reliable and efficient manner. If our solutions fail to record our customers interactions or our customers are unable to retrieve stored recordings when necessary, we may be subject to liability and our reputation may be harmed. Although we attempt to limit any potential exposure through quality assurance programs, insurance and contractual terms, we cannot assure you that we will eliminate or successfully limit our liability for any failure of our recording and storage solutions. We face risks relating to government contracts. We sell our products to, among other customers, governments and governmental entities. These sales are subject to special risks, such as delays in funding, termination of contracts or sub-contracts at the convenience of the government, termination, reduction or modification of contracts or sub-contracts in the event of changes in the governments policies or as a result of budgetary constraints, and increased or unexpected costs resulting in losses or reduced profits under fixed price contracts. Although to date we have not experienced any material problems in our performance of government contracts, or in the receipt of payments in full under such contracts, we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems in the future. 12 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully. The market for our products and related services, in general, is highly competitive. Additionally, some of our principal competitors such as Witness Systems, Inc. and Verint Systems, Inc. may have significantly greater resources and larger customer bases than do we. We have seen evidence of deep price reductions by our competitors and expect to continue to see such behavior in the future, which, if we are required to match such discounting, will adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations. To date, we have been able to manage our product design and component costs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs. Further, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in product price and cost could have a material adverse impact on our earnings. We are expanding the scope of our Voice Platforms and Applications to Enterprise Performance Management solutions, with a focus on analytic software solutions that are based on voice and data content analysis. The market for such content analysis applications is still in its early phases. Successful positioning of our products is a critical factor in our ability to maintain growth. Furthermore, new potential entrants from the traditional enterprise business intelligence and business analytics sector may decide to develop recording and content analysis capabilities and compete with us in this emerging opportunity. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant expenditures on marketing. We cannot ensure that the market awareness or demand for our new products will grow as rapidly as we expect, or if at all, that we will successfully develop new products or introduce new applications for existing products, that such new products and applications will achieve market acceptance or that the introduction of new products or technological developments by others will not adversely impact the demand for our products. The recent expansion of Voice over Internet Protocol (or VoIP) into contact centers and trading floors may allow one or more of our competitors to take a leadership position with respect to this new technology. Strategic partners may change their vendor preference as a result or may develop embedded VoIP recording as part of the VoIP switch or networking infrastructure. We cannot assure you that our products or existing partnerships will ensure sustainable leadership. 13 With respect to the market for digital video products and applications (or Video Platforms and Applications), our Video Platforms and Applications are utilized by entities in the closed circuit television, or CCTV, security, gaming and retail industries to capture, store and analyze digital video and related data. The market for our Video Platforms and Applications is highly competitive and includes products offering a broad range of features and capacities. We compete with a number of large, established manufacturers of video recording systems and distributors of similar products, as well as new emerging competitors. The price per channel of digital recording systems has decreased throughout the market in recent years, primarily due to competitive pressures. We cannot assure you that the price per channel of digital recording systems will not continue to decrease or that our gross profit will not decrease as a result. With respect to the public safety part of our business, our ability to succeed depends on our ability to develop an effective network of distributors to the mid-low segment of the public safety market, while facing pricing pressures and low barriers to entry. We face significant competition from other well-established competitors, including CVDS Inc., VoicePrint Inc. and others. Prices have decreased throughout the market in recent years, primarily due to competitive pressures. We cannot assure you that prices will not continue to decrease or that our gross profit will not decrease as a result. We believe that our ability to sell and distribute our Voice Platforms and Applications in the public safety market depends on the success of our marketing, distribution and product development initiatives. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in these initiatives. Continuing adverse conditions in the information technology sector may lead to a decreased demand for our voice platforms and applications and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the effects of general global, economic and market conditions. Our operating results may be materially adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced information technology spending, particularly in the product segments in which we compete. In particular, many enterprises, telecommunications carriers and service providers have reduced spending in connection with contact centers, and many financial institutions have reduced spending related to trading floors. Customer purchase decisions may be significantly affected by a variety of factors including trends in spending for information technology and enterprise software, market competition, and the viability or announcement of alternative technologies. If these industry-wide conditions persist, they may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on the success of the NiceLog system and related products. We are dependent on the success of the NiceLog system and related products to maintain profitability. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, approximately 75%, 78% and 78%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from sales of NiceLog systems and related products and we anticipate that such products will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales in the next several years. A significant decline in sales of NiceLog systems and related products, or a significant decrease in the profit margin on such products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 14 We may be unable to develop strategic alliances and marketing partnerships for the global distribution of our Video Platforms and Applications, which may limit our ability to successfully market and sell these products. We believe that developing marketing partnerships and strategic alliances is an important factor in our success in marketing our Video Platforms and Applications and in penetrating new markets for such products. However, unlike our Voice Platforms and Applications, we have only recently started to develop a number of strategic alliances for the marketing and distribution of our Video Platforms and Applications. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop such partnerships or strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Failure to develop such arrangements that are satisfactory to us may limit our ability to successfully market and sell our Video Platforms and Applications and may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We may be unable to commercialize new video content analysis applications. We are currently in the process of developing and commercializing new video content analysis applications that will enable real-time detection of security threats. The market for such video content analysis applications is still in an early phase. In addition, because this is a new opportunity for changing security procedures and represents a transition to proactive security management, we are not able to predict the pace at which security organizations will adopt this technology, if at all. Successful positioning of our products is a critical factor in our ability to maintain growth. New potential entrants to the market may decide to develop video content analysis capabilities and compete with us in this emerging opportunity. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant expenditures on marketing. We cannot assure you that a market for these products will develop as rapidly as we expect or at all, that we will successfully develop new products or introduce new applications for existing products, that new products or applications will meet market expectations and needs, that we will be successful in penetrating these markets and in marketing our products or that the introduction of new products or technological developments by others will not adversely impact the demand for our video content analysis applications. If the pace of spending by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is slower than anticipated, our security business will likely be adversely affected, perhaps materially. The market for our security solutions in CCTV continuous recording, public safety and law enforcement is highly dependent on the spending cycle and spending scope of the United States Department of Homeland Security, as well as local, state and municipal governments and security organizations in international markets. We cannot be sure that the spending cycle will materialize and that we will be positioned to benefit from the potential opportunities. 15 If we are unable to maintain the security of our systems, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. The occurrence of or perception of occurrence of security breaches in the operation of our business or by third parties using our products could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Some of our customers use our products to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information. We may come into contact with such information or data when we perform service or maintenance functions for our customers. While we have internal policies and procedures for employees in connection with performing these functions, the perception or fact that any of our employees has improperly handled sensitive information of a customer or a customers customer could negatively impact our business. If, in handling this information we fail to comply with our privacy policies or privacy and security laws, we could incur civil liability to government agencies, customers and individuals whose privacy was compromised. If personal information is received or used from sources outside the U.S., we could be subject to civil, administrative or criminal liability under the laws of other countries. In addition, third parties may attempt to breach our security or inappropriately use our products through computer viruses, electronic break-ins and other disruptions. If successful, confidential information, including passwords, financial information, or other personal information may be improperly obtained and we may be subject to lawsuits and other liability. Any internal or external security breaches could harm our reputation and even the perception of security risks, whether or not valid, could inhibit market acceptance of our products. Our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in the legal and regulatory environment. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to our products or us are newly implemented or changed. Additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As a global corporation, we are subject to income taxes both in Israel and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. From time to time, we are subject to income tax audits. While we believe we comply with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed additional taxes, there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. 16 Risks Relating to Israel Our business may be impacted by inflation and NIS exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations between the United States dollar and the NIS may negatively affect our earnings. A substantial majority of our revenues and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of the expenses associated with our Israeli operations, including personnel and facilities related expenses, are incurred in NIS. Consequently, inflation in Israel will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in Israel, unless it is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the NIS relative to the U.S. dollar. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation in Israel or the rate of devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar cost of our operations in Israel increases, our dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations in currency exchange rates in countries other than Israel where we operate and do business may also negatively affect our earnings. We are subject to the political, economic and military conditions in Israel. Our headquarters, research and development and main manufacturing facilities are located in the State of Israel, and we are directly affected by the political, economic and military conditions to which Israel is subject. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been a high level of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, and in January 2006, Hamas, an Islamic movement responsible for many attacks against Israelis, won the majority of the seats in the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority. The election of a majority of Hamas-supported candidates is expected to be a major obstacle to relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as to the stability in the Middle East as a whole. Acts of terrorism, armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect local business conditions and harm our results of operations. We cannot predict the effect on the region of any diplomatic initiatives or political developments involving Israel or the Palestinians or other countries in the Middle East. Furthermore, several countries restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional companies may restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies as a result of an increase in hostilities. Our products are heavily dependent upon components imported from, and most of our sales are made to, countries outside of Israel. Accordingly, our operations could be materially adversely affected if trade between Israel and its present trading partners were interrupted or curtailed. Some of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual military reserve duty. Additionally, in the event of a military conflict, including the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians, these persons could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. We cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on our workforce or business and we cannot predict the effect on us of any expansion or reduction of these obligations. 17 Service and enforcement of legal process on us and our directors and officers may be difficult to obtain. Service of process upon our directors and officers, most of whom reside outside the United States, may be difficult to obtain within the United States. Furthermore, since the majority of our assets and most of our directors and officers are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against us or these individuals or entities may not be collectible within the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, in original actions instituted in Israel. However, subject to certain time limitations and other conditions, Israeli courts may enforce final judgments of United States courts for liquidated amounts in civil matters, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of those Acts. We depend on the availability of government grants and tax benefits. We derive and expect to continue to derive significant benefits from various programs and laws in Israel including tax benefits relating to our Approved Enterprise programs and certain grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor, or OCS, for research and development. To be eligible for these grants, programs and tax benefits, we must continue to meet certain conditions, including making certain specified investments in fixed assets and conducting the research, development and manufacturing of products developed with such OCS grants in Israel (unless a special approval has been granted for performing manufacturing activities outside Israel). From time to time, the Israeli Government has discussed reducing or eliminating the availability of these grants, programs and benefits and there can be no assurance that the Israeli Governments support of grants, programs and benefits will continue. If grants, programs and benefits available to us or the laws, rules and regulations under which they were granted are eliminated or their scope is further reduced, or if we fail to meet the conditions of existing grants, programs or benefits and are required to refund grants or tax benefits already received (together with interest and certain inflation adjustments) or fail to meet the criteria for future Approved Enterprises, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. On April 1, 2005, an amendment to the Israeli law which deals with Approved Enterprises came into force. Pursuant to the amendment, a companys facility will be granted the status of Approved Enterprise only if it is proven to be an industrial facility (as defined in such law) that contributes to the economic independence of the Israeli economy and is a competitive facility that contributes to the Israeli gross domestic product. The amendment incorporates certain changes to both the criteria and procedure for obtaining Approved Enterprise status for an investment program, and changes to the tax benefits afforded in certain circumstances to Approved Enterprises under such law (which in some cases is referred to as a Benefiting Enterprise following such amendment). The amendment will apply to Approved Enterprise programs in which the year of commencement of benefits under the law is 2004 or later, unless such programs received approval from the applicable government authority prior to December 31, 2004, in which case the provisions of the amendment will not apply. 18 As a result of the amendment, where we benefit from tax-exempt income pursuant to the new Benefiting Enterprise regime, we will be subject to taxes upon the distribution of such tax-exempt income or upon our liquidation. Accordingly, we may be required to record a deferred tax liability with respect to such tax-exempt income. We are currently evaluating the impact of the amendment on us. Based on our preliminary analysis, it may materially increase our provision for income taxes in future years. We may be required to pay stamp duty on agreements executed by us between June 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005. This would increase our taxes. The Israeli Stamp Duty on Documents Law, 1961 (the Stamp Duty Law), provided that most documents signed by Israeli companies were subject to a stamp duty, generally at a rate of between 0.4% and 1% of the value of the subject matter of such document. De facto, it was common practice in Israel not to pay such stamp duty unless a document was filed with a governmental authority or with the courts. As a result of an amendment to the Stamp Duty Law that came into effect on June 1, 2003, the Israeli tax authorities have approached many companies in Israel (including us) and requested the disclosure of all agreements signed by such companies after June 1, 2003 with the aim of collecting stamp duty on such agreements. Based on advice from our Israeli counsel, we believe that we may only be required to pay stamp duty on documents signed on or after August 2004. However, we cannot give any assurance that the tax authorities or the courts will accept such view. At this stage it is not yet possible to evaluate the effect, if any, on us of the 2003 amendment to the Stamp Duty Law. Under an order published in December 2005, the said requirement to pay stamp duty was cancelled with respect to documents signed on or after January 1, 2006. Risks Related to our Ordinary Shares and ADSs Our share price is volatile and may decline. Numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our ordinary shares or our ADSs, each of which represents one ordinary share, to fluctuate significantly. These factors include, among other things, announcements of technological innovations, development of or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights, customer orders or new products by us or our competitors, currency exchange rate fluctuations, earnings releases by us or our competitors, market conditions in the industry and the general state of the securities markets, with particular emphasis on the technology and Israeli sectors of the securities markets. 19 Our operating results in one or more future periods may fluctuate significantly and may cause our share price to be volatile. The sales cycle for our products and services is variable, typically ranging between a few weeks to several months from initial contact with the potential client to the signing of a contract. Frequently, sales orders accumulate towards the latter part of a given quarter. Looking forward, given the lead time required by our contract manufacturer, if a large portion of sales orders are received late in the quarter, we may not be able to deliver products within the quarter and thus such sales will be deferred to a future quarter. There can be no assurance that such deferrals will result in sales in the near term, or at all. Thus, delays in executing client orders may affect our revenue and cause our operating results to vary widely. Additionally, as a high percentage of our expenses, particularly employee compensation, is relatively fixed, a variation in the level of sales, especially at or near the end of any quarter, may have a material adverse impact on our quarterly operating results. In addition, our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations due to other factors, including the timing and size of orders and shipments to customers, variations in distribution channels, mix of products, new product introductions, competitive pressures and general economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the exact mix of products for any period between hardware, software and services as well as within the product category between audio platforms and related applications, digital video and communications intelligence. Because a significant portion of our overhead consists of fixed costs, our quarterly results may be adversely impacted if sales fall below managements expectations. In addition, the period of time from order to delivery of our Audio and Video Platforms and Applications is short, and therefore our backlog for such products is currently, and is expected to continue to be, small and substantially unrelated to the level of sales in subsequent periods. As a result, our results of operations for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of results for any future period. Due to all of the foregoing factors, in some future quarters our sales or operating results may be below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts or investors. In such event, the market price of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially adversely affected. 20
