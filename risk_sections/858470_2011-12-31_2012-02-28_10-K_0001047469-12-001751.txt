Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information about these risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. 44 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 and 2010 Compared We reported net income for 2011 of $122.4 million, or $0.59 per share. During 2010, we reported net income of $103.4 million, or $0.50 per share. Net income increased in 2011 by $19.0 million, primarily due to increased operating revenues, partially offset by increased operating expenses, decreased gain on sale of assets and increased income tax and interest expenses. Operating revenues increased by $116.8 million largely due to increased natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues, partially offset by a decrease in brokered natural gas revenues. Operating expenses increased by $33.4 million between periods primarily due to increases in transportation and gathering expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization and direct operations, partially offset by a decrease in impairment of oil and gas properties and lower brokered natural gas cost, taxes other than income and exploration expense. Revenue, Price and Volume Variances Below is a discussion of revenue, price and volume variances.

(2)These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $1.01 per Bbl in 2011 and by $22.31 per Bbl in 2010. 45 Table of Contents Natural Gas Revenues The increase in Natural Gas revenues of $83.6 million, excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above, is primarily due to increased production, partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices. The increased production is primarily due to increased production associated with our Marcellus Shale drilling program in northeast Pennsylvania, partially offset by decreases in production primarily in east and south Texas due to normal production declines, the sale of oil and gas properties in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming and a shift from gas to oil projects. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The increase in Crude Oil and Condensate revenues of $46.9 million is primarily due to increased production, partially offset by lower realized oil prices. The increase in production is primarily due to our drilling program in the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas, partially offset by lower production in east Texas due to decreased activity.

The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $12.6 million from 2010 to 2011. See the preceding table titled "Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost" for further analysis. Direct Operations increased $7.8 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production. Contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast Pennsylvania as a result of the PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement. Offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance, subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in 2011 compared to 2010 coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast Pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of 2010. Transportation and Gathering increased by $54.3 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2011, primarily in northeast Pennsylvania. Taxes Other Than Income decreased $10.3 million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in 2011 on qualifying wells, lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense. Exploration decreased $6.3 million due to lower geophysical and geological costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data, partially offset by higher dry hole costs in 2011 related to an exploratory dry hole in Montana. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $16.1 million, of which $29.8 million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower DD&A rate of $1.64 per Mcfe for 2011 compared to $2.12 per Mcfe for 2010 and a $1.4 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations. The increase in depletion and depreciation was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of $15.1 million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities. 47 Table of Contents Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties decreased by $40.9 million from 2011 to 2010 due to the impairment of two south Texas fields recognized as a result of continued price declines and limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in 2010. There were no impairments in 2011. General and Administrative increased by $25.5 million primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $25.1 million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares as a result of our higher average stock price for the month of December 2011 compared to the average stock price for the month of December 2010. Higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase. These increases are partially offset by lower legal and professional costs associated with the PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement executed in 2010. Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets During 2011, we recognized a gain of $34.2 million from the sale of oil and gas properties in east Texas and an aggregate gain of $29.2 million related to the sale of various other assets as part of our ongoing asset portfolio management program. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $49.3 million from the sale of our Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure, $40.7 million from the sale of our investment in Tourmaline and an aggregate gain of $16.3 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year. Interest Expense, Net Interest Expense and Other increased by $3.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average effective interest rate on the credit facility, which increased to approximately 4.1% during the 2011 compared to approximately 3.8% during 2010, partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average borrowings under our credit facility based on average daily balances of $317.7 million during 2011 compared to average daily balances of $340.4 million during 2010. In addition, in December 2010, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of 5.58% weighted-average fixed rate notes, which increased interest expense recognized in 2011. Income Tax Expense Income Tax Expense increased by $17.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased pretax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 48.0% and 47.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was slightly higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a continued shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states, primarily Pennsylvania, as a result of our continued focus on development of our Marcellus shale properties. 2010 and 2009 Compared We reported net income for 2010 of $103.4 million, or $0.50 per share. During 2009, we reported net income of $148.3 million, or $0.72 per share. Net income decreased in 2010 by $45.0 million, primarily due to increased operating expenses, income tax and interest expenses and decreased operating revenues partially offset by increased gain on sale of assets. Operating revenues decreased by $30.0 million largely due to decreases in natural gas and brokered natural gas revenues, partially offset by an increase in crude oil and condensate revenues. Operating expenses increased by $95.4 million between periods due primarily to increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets, general and administrative expense, transportation and 48 Table of Contents gathering and direct operations. These increases were partially offset by decreases in brokered natural gas cost, taxes other than income and exploration expense.

(2)These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $22.31 per Bbl in 2010 and by $28.85 per Bbl in 2009. Natural Gas Revenues The decrease in Natural Gas revenue of $31.6 million, excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above, is due primarily to the decrease in realized natural gas prices, decreased production in east and south Texas associated with normal production declines, delays in completions and a shift from gas to oil projects, as well as the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in natural gas production in the northeast Pennsylvania associated with increased drilling and the start up of a portion of the Lathrop compressor station in the Marcellus shale at the end of the second quarter of 2010. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The $9.2 million increase in crude oil and condensate revenues is primarily due to an increase in realized crude oil prices and an increase in crude oil production in the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas and the Pettet formation production in east Texas. These increases are partially offset by lower 49 Table of Contents production in West Virginia and northeast Pennsylvania as well as the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009.

The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $10.6 million from 2009 to 2010. See the preceding table titled "Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost" for further analysis. Direct Operations expenses increased by $5.7 million primarily due to lease maintenance expense and plug and abandonment costs in northeast Pennsylvania related to plugging and abandoning three vertical wells in accordance with the PaDEP's Second Modified Consent Order. Transportation and Gathering costs increased by $5.3 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2010 primarily in northeast Pennsylvania. Taxes Other Than Income decreased by $6.8 million primarily due to decreased production and ad valorem taxes due to lower natural gas prices and property values partially offset by increased business and occupational taxes and franchise taxes. Exploration expense decreased by $8.1 million primarily due to lower dry hole costs as a result of drilling one dry hole in 2010 compared to two dry holes in 2009. The decrease was partially offset by higher geophysical and geological expenses associated with seismic purchases related to our Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale properties during 2010. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $75.8 million primarily due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes, partially offset by a lower DD&A rate of $2.12 per Mcfe for 2010 compared to $2.14 per Mcfe in 2009. Amortization of unproved properties increased $17.6 million primarily due to increased unproved leasehold costs in northeast Pennsylvania and the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas in late 2009 and continuing into 2010. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Other Assets increased by $23.3 million from 2009 to 2010. Impairments in 2010 consisted of a $35.8 million impairment of two south Texas fields due to continued price declines and limited activity and a $5.1 million impairment related to drilling and service equipment. Impairments in 2009 consisted of a $17.6 million impairment of two fields in Colorado and south Texas due to lower well performance. 51 Table of Contents General and Administrative expenses increased by $10.8 million primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in legal expenses primarily related to the December 2010 PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement, ongoing litigation and related legal fees, a $8.3 million increase in pension expense primarily due to termination and amendment of our pension plans and a $2.4 million increase in incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by an $8.5 million decrease in stock compensation expense primarily due to prior year awards that fully vested in February 2010 and a reduction in average stock price for the month of December 2010 compared to the average stock price for the month of December 2009. Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets During 2010, we recognized a gain of $49.3 million from the sale of our Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure, $40.7 million from the sale of our investment in Tourmaline and an aggregate gain of $16.3 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year. During 2009, we recognized a $16.0 million loss on sale of assets primarily due to the sale of our Canadian properties, partially offset by a $12.7 million gain on sale of assets related to the sale of oil and gas properties in West Virginia. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased by $9.0 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to an increase in weighted-average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances of approximately $340.4 million during 2010 compared to approximately $166.0 million during 2009, and to a lesser extent to the $175.0 million of debt we issued in December 2010. The weighted-average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 3.8% during 2010 compared to approximately 4.0% during 2009. Interest expense in 2010 also includes a make-whole premium payment of $2.8 million associated with the early payment of $75.0 million of the 7.33% fixed rate notes that were due in July 2011. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $20.2 million due to a higher effective tax rate offset by a decrease in our pre-tax income. The effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 47.9% and 33.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states, primarily in Pennsylvania, as a result of our increased focus on development of our Marcellus shale properties. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices. Realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and market prices for North American natural gas production. Commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to 52 Table of Contents us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks. All of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2011, we had 37 derivative contracts open: 23 natural gas price swap arrangements, six natural gas basis swaps arrangements, three crude oil price swap arrangements and five natural gas collar arrangements. During 2011, we entered into 31 new derivative contracts covering anticipated natural gas and crude oil production for 2011, 2012, and 2013. As of December 31, 2011, we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives: Commodity and Derivative Type Weighted-Average Contract Price Volume Contract Period Net Unrealized Gain / (Loss) (In thousands) Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Natural Gas Swaps $5.22 per Mcf 95,998 Mmcf Jan. 2012 - Dec. 2012 178,550 Natural Gas Collars $6.20 Ceiling/ $5.15 Floor per Mcf 17,729 Mmcf Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2013 21,429 Crude Oil Swaps $98.28 per Bbl 732 Mbbl Jan. 2012 - Dec. 2012 (387 ) $ 199,592 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Natural Gas Basis Swaps $(0.27) per Mcf 17,042 Mmcf Jan. 2012 - Dec. 2012 (3,107 ) $ 196,485 The amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain / (loss) column in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at December 31, 2011 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk of $1.4 million. Nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank. From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap and collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market-based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under the collar agreements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index price falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. We had natural gas price swaps covering 74.9 Bcf, or 42%, of our 2011 natural gas production at an average price of $5.30 per Mcf. We had one crude oil swap covering 275 Mbbl, or 20%, of our 2011 crude oil production, at an average price of $106.20 per Bbl. During 2011, crude oil collars covered 365 Mbbl, or 26% of total crude oil production, at an average price of $90.88 per Bbl. We are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is 53 Table of Contents generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non-performance by third parties are substantially smaller. We do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non-performance by third parties. Our primary derivative contract counterparties are Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The preceding paragraphs contain forward-looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities. See "Forward-Looking Information" for further details. Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt, including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate. The credit spread is our default or repayment risk. The credit spread (premium or discount) is determined by comparing our fixed-rate notes and credit facility to new issuances (secured and unsecured) and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt. The fair value of all of the fixed-rate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us. We use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt. The carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt are as follows: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (In thousands) Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Long-Term Debt $ 950,000 $ 1,082,531 $ 975,000 $ 1,100,830 54 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Houston, Texas February 28, 2012 56 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas liquids exclusively within the continental United States. The Company also transports, stores, gathers and purchases natural gas for resale. The Company's exploration and development activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. The Company operates in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation and exploration. The Company's oil and gas properties are managed as a whole rather than through discrete operating segments or business units. Operational information is tracked by geographic area; however, financial performance is assessed as a single enterprise and not on a geographic basis. Allocation of resources is made on a project basis across the Company's entire portfolio without regard to geographic areas. The consolidated financial statements contain the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year statements to conform with current year presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on net income. On January 3, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 split of the Company's common stock in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was distributed on January 25, 2012 to shareholders of record as of January 17, 2012. All common stock accounts and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 2-for-1 split of the Company's common stock. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs." The amendments in this update generally represent clarifications of Topic 820, but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed. This update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application is not permitted. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income." This update was amended in December 2011 by ASU No. 2011-12, "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05." This update defers only those changes in update 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. All other requirements in update 2011-05 are not affected by this update, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. ASU No. 2011-05 and 2011-12 are effective for fiscal years (including 62 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." The amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company does not expect this guidance to have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were primarily concentrated in one financial institution at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of these institutions and considers any possible credit risk to be minimal. Inventories Inventories are comprised of natural gas in storage, tubular goods and well equipment and pipeline imbalances. All inventory balances are carried at the lower of average cost or market. Natural gas gathering and pipeline operations normally include imbalance arrangements with the pipeline. The volumes of natural gas due to or from the Company under imbalance arrangements are recorded at actual selling or purchase prices, as the case may be, and are adjusted monthly to reflect market changes. The net pipeline imbalance is included in inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables that the Company determines to be uncollectible based on the specific identification basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts, which is netted against Accounts Receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $3.3 million and $4.1 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accounts Payable This account may include credit balances from outstanding checks in zero balance cash accounts. These credit balances are referred to as book overdrafts and are included as a component of Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. There were no credit balances from outstanding checks in zero balance cash accounts included in Accounts Payable at December 31, 2011 and 2010 as sufficient cash was available for offset. Properties and Equipment The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. 63 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs, are expensed. Development costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves. The determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, and engineering data. If a well is determined to be successful, the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well. If a well is determined to be unsuccessful, the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to exploration expense in the period the determination is made. If an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production can begin, the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found only as long as: i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii) drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future. If drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned, or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves, the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired and its costs are charged to exploration expense. Development costs of proved oil and gas properties, including estimated dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs, are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the units-of-production method using proved developed and proved reserves, respectively. Properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years. Generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12 to 25 years, gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10 to 16 years. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 25 to 40 years. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years. Costs of retired, sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization if the units-of-production rate is not significantly affected. Accordingly, a gain or loss, if any, is recognized only when a group of proved properties (entire field) that make up the amortization base has been retired, abandoned or sold. The Company evaluates its oil and gas properties and other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on estimates of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil. 64 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Costs attributable to the Company's unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above; however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, amortization associated with the Company's unproved properties was $32.5 million, $47.6 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and is included in Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Subsequently, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's useful life. The majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the Company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells. However, liabilities are also recorded for meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. At December 31, 2011, there were no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. Additional retirement obligations increase the liability associated with new oil and gas wells and other facilities as these obligations are incurred. Accretion expense is included in Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization expense on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Risk Management Activities From time to time, the Company enters into derivative contracts, such as natural gas and crude oil price swaps or zero-cost price collars, as a hedging strategy to manage commodity price risk associated with its production or other contractual commitments. All hedge transactions are subject to the Company's risk management policy which does not permit speculative trading activities. Gains or losses on these hedging activities are generally recognized over the period that its production or other underlying commitment is hedged as an offset to the specific hedged item. Cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as cash flows from operations. If a hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity, gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period that the underlying production or other contractual commitment is delivered. Unrealized gains or losses associated with any derivative contract not considered a hedge are recognized currently in the results of operations. When the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures or is sold, extinguished or terminated, derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on the sale or settlement of the underlying item. For example, in the case of natural gas price hedges, the gain or loss is reflected in natural gas revenue. When a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if the hedge is no longer effective, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in the results of operations to the extent the market value changes in the derivative have not been offset by the effects of the price changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the amended disclosure requirements prescribed in ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging." 65 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Revenue Recognition Gas Imbalances The Company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers. Natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties. Production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances. A natural gas imbalance liability is recorded at the actual price realized upon the gas sale in Accounts Payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet if the Company's excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties. Brokered Natural Gas Margin The revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses in accordance with ASC 605-45, "Revenue Recognition: Principle Agent Considerations". The Company realizes brokered margin as a result of buying and selling natural gas utilizing separate purchase and sale transactions, typically with separate counterparties, whereby the Company and/or the counterparty takes title to the natural gas purchased or sold. The Company realized $7.4 million, $8.8 million and $8.3 million of brokered natural gas margin in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Natural Gas Measurement The Company records estimated amounts for natural gas revenues and natural gas purchase costs based on volumetric calculations under its natural gas sales and purchase contracts. Variances or imbalances resulting from such calculations are inherent in natural gas sales, production, operation, measurement, and administration. Management does not believe that differences between actual and estimated natural gas revenues or purchase costs attributable to the unresolved variances or imbalances are material. Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company is required to make judgments, including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the Company has taken. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. The amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the 66 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in Interest Expense and Other and accrued penalties related to such positions in General and Administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under ASC 718. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black-Scholes valuation model may be used. Stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in General and Administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The tax benefit for stock-based compensation is included as both a cash inflow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In accordance with ASC 718, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the Company's income taxes payable. The Company did not recognize a tax benefit for stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company realized tax benefits of $13.8 million. Environmental Matters Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed. Liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when received. Market Risk The Company's primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices. Realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable. Credit Risk Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas price agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non-performance by third parties are substantially smaller. The Company does not anticipate any material impact on its financial results due to non-performance by the third parties. In 2011, the Company did not have any one customer account for greater than 10% of the Company's total sales. In 2010, one customer accounted for approximately 11%, of the Company's total sales. In 2009, two customers accounted for approximately 13% and 11%, respectively of the Company's total sales. 67 Table of Contents CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements, the Company follows generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates pertain to proved natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil reserves and related cash flow estimates used in impairment tests of oil and gas properties, natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil revenues and expenses, current values of derivative instruments, as well as estimates of expenses related to legal, environmental and other contingencies, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset retirement obligations, pension and postretirement obligations, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
