D. Risk Factors Kimber is subject to a number of significant risks due to the nature of its business and the present stage of its business development. Readers should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to invest in Kimber Common Shares. Kimbers failure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the trading price of its Common Shares may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Kimber cannot give assurance that it will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect its business. Estimates of mineralized material are inherently forward-looking statements subject to error. Although Mineral Resource estimates require a high degree of assurance in the underlying data when the estimates are made, unforeseen e vents and uncontrollable factors can have significant adverse or positive impacts on the estimates. Actual results will inherently differ from estimates. The unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors include: geologic uncertainties including inherent sample variability, metal price fluctuations, variations in mining and processing parameters, and adverse changes in environmental or mining laws and regulations. The timing and effects of variances from estimated values cannot be accurately predicted. 16 The following risk factors should be considered: Industry Risks Resource exploration and development is a high risk, speculative business. Resource exploration and development is a speculative business, characterized by a high number of failures. Substantial expenditures are required to discovernew properties and to develop the infrastructure, mining and processing facilities at any site chosen for mining. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery or Mineral Reserves will in fact be realized by Kimber or that any identified mineral deposit identified by Kimber will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. Mineral exploration is subject to numerous industry operating hazards and risks, many of which are beyond Kimbers control and any one of which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition and operations. The operations in which Kimber has a direct or indirect interest will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to resource companies. Fires, power outages, labour disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labour are some of the industry operating risks involved in the operation of mines and the conduct of exploration programs. If any of these events were to occur, they could cause injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property. As a result, Kimber could be the subject of a regulatory investigation, potentially leading to penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, Kimber may have to make expensive repairs and could be subject to legal liability. The occurrence of any of these operating risks and hazards may have an adverse effect on Kimbers financial condition and operations, and correspondingly on the value and price of Kimbers Common Shares. Metal prices have fluctuated widely in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future which may adversely affect the amount of revenues derived from production of Mineral Reserves. The commercial feasibility of Kimbers properties and its ability to arrange funding to conduct its planned exploration projects is dependent on, among other things, the price of gold and silver. Depending on the price to be received for any minerals produced, Kimber may determine that it is impractical to commence or continue commercial production. A reduction in the price of gold or silver may prevent Kimbers properties from being economically mined or result in the write-off of assets whose value is impaired as a result of low precious metals prices. Future revenues, if any, are expected to be in large part derived from the future mining and sale of gold and silver or interests related thereto. The prices of these commodities fluctuate and are affected by numerous factors beyond Kimber’s control, including, among others: · international economic and political conditions, · expectations of inflation or deflation, 17 · international currency exchange rates, · interest rates, · global or regional consumptive patterns, · speculative activities, · levels of supply and demand, · increased production due to new mine developments, · decreased production due to mine closures, · improved mining and production methods, · availability and costs of metal substitutes, · metal stock levels maintained by producers and others, and · inventory carrying costs. The effect of these factors on the price of precious and base metals cannot be accurately predicted. If the price of gold and silver decreases, the value of Kimbers assets would be materially and adversely effected, thereby materially and adversely impacting the value and price of Kimbers Common Shares. Exploration activities are subject to geologic uncertainty and inherent variability. There is inherent variability between duplicate samples taken adjacent to each other and between sampling points that cannot be reasonably eliminated. There may also be unknown geologic details that have not been identified or correctly appreciated at the current level of delineation. This results in uncertainties that cannot be reasonably eliminated from the estimation process. Some of the resulting variances can have a positive effect and others can have a negative effect on mining and processing operations. The quantification of Mineral Resources is based on estimates and is subject to great uncertainty. The calculations of amounts of mineralized material are estimates only. Actual recoveries of gold and silver from mineralized material may be lower than those indicated by test work. Any material change in the quantity of mineralization, grade or stripping ratio, or the gold and silver price may affect the economic viability of a mineral property. In addition, there can be no assurance that gold and silver recoveries in small-scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. Notwithstanding pilot plant tests for metallurgy and other factors there remains the possibility that the ore may not react in commercial production in the same manner as it did in testing. Mining and metallurgy are an inexact science and accordingly there always remains an element of risk that a mine may not prove to be commercially viable. Until an un-mined deposit is actually mined and processed, the quantity of Mineral Reserves, Mineral Resources and grades must be considered as estimates only. In addition, the quantity of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources may vary depending on, among other things, metal prices. Any material change in quantity of Mineral Reserves, Mineral Resources, grade, percent extraction of those Mineral Reserves recoverable by underground mining techniques or stripping ratio for those Mineral Reserves recoverable by open pit mining techniques may affect the economic viability of a mining project. 18 The recent unprecedented events in global financial markets have had a profound impact on the global economy, in general and on the mining industry in particular. Many industries, including the precious and base metal mining industry, are impacted by global market conditions. Some of the key impacts of the current financial market turmoil include contraction in credit markets resulting in a widening of credit risk, devaluations and high volatility in global equity, commodity, foreign exchange and precious metal markets, and a lack of market liquidity. A continued or worsened slowdown in the financial markets or other economic conditions, including but not limited to, reduced consumer spending, increased unemployment rates, deteriorating business conditions, inflation, deflation, volatile fuel and energy costs, increased consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, changes in interest rates and tax rates may adversely affect Kimbers growth and profitability potential. Specifically:  the global credit/liquidity crisis could impact the cost and availability of financing and Kimbers overall liquidity;  the volatility of gold and silver prices may impact Kimbers future revenues, profits and cash flow;  volatile energy prices, commodity and consumables prices and currency exchange rates impact potential production costs; and  the devaluation and volatility of global stock markets impacts the valuation of Kimbers equity securities, which may impact its ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity. These factors could have a material adverse effect on Kimbers financial condition and results of operations. Increased operating and capital costs may adversely affect the viability of existing and proposed mining projects. Until the recent events in the global financial markets, increases in the prices of labour and materials, to some extent caused by an increase in commodity prices, including the prices of the metals being mined by the industry, led to significantly increased capital and operating costs for mining projects. Increasing costs are a factor that must be built in to the economic model for any mining project. Significant operating cost increases as experienced by the industry in recent years prior to the recent financial crisis had the effect of reducing profit margins for some mining projects. Such increases in both operating and capital costs need to be factored into economic assessments of existing and proposed mining projects and may increase the financing requirements for such projects or render such projects uneconomic. Company Risks Kimber faces substantial competition within the mining industry from other mineral companies with much greater financial and technical resources and may not be able to effectively compete which would have an adverse effect on Kimbers financial condition and operations. The mineral resource industry is intensively competitive in all of its phases, and Kimber competes with many companies possessing much greater financial and technical research resources. Competition is particularly intense with respect to the acquisition of desirable undeveloped gold and silver properties. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such undeveloped properties include the staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and purchase such properties, and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties. Competition could adversely affect Kimbers ability to acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future. 19 Kimbers exploration efforts may be unsuccessful in locating viable Mineral Resources. Resource exploration and, if warranted, development is a speculative business, characterized by a number of significant risks, including, among other things, unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but also from finding mineral deposits, which, though present, are insufficient in volume and/or grade to return a profit from production. There is no certainty that the expenditures that have been made and may be made in the future by Kimber related to the exploration of its properties will result in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery or Mineral Reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. If Kimber is unable to develop acceptable overall gold and silver recovery levels, the Carmen deposit may not be a viable project and Kimber will have to continue to explore for a viable deposit or cease operations. Recovery levels for gold and silver are based upon metallurgical testing of samples taken from drill samples. Numerous factors may affect the recoverability of gold and silver from any given rock and tests of such samples may not be representative of recoveries to be obtained from the entire deposit. Currently, Kimbers metallurgical recovery tests for gold currently have an acceptable average of over 90%. However, silver recoveries vary significantly across the Carmen deposit, ranging from a low of 8.6% to a high of 97.3%. Kimbers overall silver metallurgical recoveries may not be adequate for the Carmen deposit to be commercially viable. If Kimber Mineral Resource estimates are not indicative of the actual gold and silver that can be mined, the mineable gold and silver that can be recovered from the Carmen deposit may be less than the Mineral Resource estimate and the Carmen deposit may not be a viable project. Assays results from core drilling or reverse circulation drilling can be subject to errors at the laboratory analyzing the drill samples. In addition, reverse circulation or core drilling may lead to samples which may not be representative of the gold and silver ore in the entire deposit. Mineral Resource estimates are based on interpretation of available facts and extrapolation or interpolation of data and may not be representative of the actual deposit. All of these factors may lead to a Mineral Resource estimate which is overstated. If Kimbers Mineral Resource estimates for the Carmen deposit are not indicative of actual recoverable gold and silver, Kimber will have to continue to explore for a viable deposit or cease operations. Kimber has a limited history as an exploration company and does not have any experience in putting a mining project into production. Kimber has only been actively engaged in exploration since 1999. Kimber does not hold any mineral reserves and does not generate any revenues from production. Kimbers success will depend largely upon its ability to locate and develop commercially viable Mineral Reserves, which may never happen. Further putting a mining project into production requires substantial planning and expenditures and Kimber does not have any experience in taking a mining project to production. As a result of these factors, it is difficult to evaluate Kimbers prospects, and its future success is more uncertain than if it had a longer or more proven history. 20 Kimber expects to continue to incur losses and may never achieve profitability, which in turn may harm the future operating performance and may cause the market price of Kimbers Common Shares to decline. Kimber has incurred net losses every year since inception on March 31, 1995 and as of June 30, 2009 had an accumulated deficit of $15,868,777. Kimber incurred a net loss of $2,391,005 for the year ended June 30, 2009 and $2,937,925 for the year ended June 30, 2008. Kimber currently has no commercial production and has never recorded any revenues from mining operations. Kimber expect to continue to incur losses, and will continue to do so until such time, if ever, as its properties commence commercial production and generate sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. The development of new mining operations will require the commitment of substantial resources for operating expenses and capital expenditures, which may increase in subsequent years as Kimber adds, as needed, consultants, personnel and equipment associated with advancing exploration, development and commercial production of its properties. The amounts and timing of expenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing exploration and development, the results of consultants analyses and recommendations, the rate at which operating losses are incurred, the execution of any joint venture or other agreements with others in the future, its acquisition of additional properties, and other factors, many of which are unknown today and may be beyond its control. Kimber may never generate any revenues or achieve profitability. If Kimber does not achieve profitability it will have to raise additional financing or shut down its operations. Kimbers title to its mineral properties and its validity may be disputed in the future by others claiming title to all or part of such properties. Kimbers properties consist of various mining concessions in Mexico. Under the Mexican law, the concessions may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers, which may affect the validity of Kimbers ownership of such concessions. A claim by a third party asserting prior unregistered agreements or transfer on any of Kimbers mineral properties, especially where commercially viable Mineral Reserves have been located, could adversely result in Kimber losing commercially viable Mineral Reserves. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, it may potentially affect Kimbers current operations due to the high costs of defending against such claims and its impact on senior management's time. If Kimber loses a commercially viable Mineral Reserve, such a loss could lower Kimbers revenues or cause it to cease operations if this Mineral Reserve represented all or a significant portion of Kimbers operations at the time of the loss. Kimbers properties are located in Mexico, which can lead to difficulty with changes in political conditions and regulations, currency exchange, in obtaining financing, finding and hiring qualified people or obtaining all necessary services for Kimbers operations in Mexico. All of Kimbers properties, including its principal project, Monterde, are located in Mexico. Mexico has in the past been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, which, if they were to arise again, could cause changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Kimbers mineral exploration and mining activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to Kimbers activities or maintaining its properties. In addition, recent increases in kidnapping and violent drug related criminal activity in Mexico, and in particular Mexican States bordering the United States, may adversely affect Kimbers ability to carry on business safely. The cost of exploration and future capital and operating costs are affected by foreign exchange rates for the Canadian dollar, United States dollar and Mexican peso. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the United States dollar and Mexican peso versus the Canadian dollar could lead to increased costs reported in Canadian dollars or foreign exchange losses in respect to United States dollar or Mexican peso working capital balances held by Kimber. There can be no assurance that foreign exchange fluctuations will not materially adversely affect Kimbers financial performance and results of operations. 21 It may be difficult for Kimber to obtain necessary financing for its planned exploration or development activities because of their location in Mexico. Also, it may be difficult to find and hire qualified people in the mining industry who are situated in Mexico or to obtain all of the necessary services or expertise in Mexico or to conduct operations on its projects at reasonable rates. If qualified people and services or expertise cannot be obtained in Mexico, Kimber may need to seek and obtain those services from people located outside of Mexico which will require work permits and compliance with applicable laws and could result in delays and higher costs to Kimber to conduct its operations in Mexico. The occurrence of the various foregoing factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on Kimbers operations or future profitability. Kimber originally contemplated an open pit mining operation on the Carmen deposit, however it is currently contemplating the possibility of a combined open pit and underground mining operation, the effect of which, if it were to proceed to production, would expose Kimber to increased costs, potential time delays and risks to underground workers. The change in concept from an open pit to a combined open pit and underground mining operation would, if it proceeds on this basis expose Kimber to the inherent risks of underground mining including increased costs, time delays in developing underground operations and safety issues. The development of any mine plan and feasibility study must take these factors into consideration and may negatively impact the viability of the project. If the Carmen deposit is not a viable project as a combined open pit/underground mine Kimber would have to continue to explore for a viable deposit or cease operations. Kimber is subject to numerous government regulations which could cause delays in carrying out its operations, and increase costs related to its business. Kimbers mineral exploration and development activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing operations, taxes, labour standards and occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances, land use, water use, land claims of local people and other matters. No assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail exploration, development or production. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations, or more stringent implementation thereof could substantially increase the costs associated with Kimbers business or prevent it from exploring or developing its properties. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining and exploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on Kimber and cause increases in exploration expenses, capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties. Kimber has not completed an environmental impact statement, nor has it received the necessary permits for water or explosives to conduct mining operations. The department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is SEMARNAT (Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales) and it has broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with environmental regulations or standards. Regulations require that an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a Manifiesto de Impacto Ambiental or MIA, be prepared by a third-party contractor for submittal to SEMARNAT. An MIA is required prior to mine construction. Studies required to support the MIA include a detailed analysis of the following areas: soil, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The regulatory process in Mexico does not have a public review component but proof of local community support for a project is required to gain final MIA approval. A risk analysis must also be prepared in conjunction with the MIA for approval by SEMARNAT. To date this risk analysis has not been prepared 22 A number of other approvals, licenses and permits are required for various aspects of a mines development. The most significant permits for the development of the Monterde Property, other than MIA approval, are water rights concessions, or permits to extract water, issued by the National Water Commission (Comisión Nacional del Agua), and a permit for consumption, use and storage of explosives, or blasting permit, issued by the Mexican National Defence Secretariat (Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional). Failure to obtain the necessary permits would adversely affect progress of Kimbers operations and would delay the beginning of commercial operations. The Monterde Property is located in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico which have been subject to episodes of unusually high rainfall in past years resulting in washouts and erosion of soil. Continuing increased rainfall may result in increased costs and delays in operations. Seasonal rains are a factor that must be considered when carrying on operations in areas such as the Sierra Madre where excessive rain fall may hamper operations. Some other companies carrying on operations in areas of heavy seasonal rains have been severely impacted by the rainfall and on occasion have been required to cease operations. If Kimbers operations are severely impacted by the weather, then it may be required to carry out remedial work and/or cease operations until the seasonal rains come to an end. Kimber depends on key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts but does not maintain key person insurance. Kimber is dependent on a relatively small number of key personnel, the loss of any of whom could have an adverse effect on the operations of Kimber. Kimbers success is dependent to a great degree on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management personnel. The loss of such key personnel, through incapacity or otherwise, would require Kimber to seek and retain other qualified personnel and could compromise the pace and success of its exploration activities. Kimber does not maintain key person insurance in the event of a loss of any such key personnel. Kimber does not have a full staff of technical people and relies upon outside consultants to provide critical services. Kimber has a relatively small staff and depends upon its ability to hire consultants with the appropriate background and expertise as they are required to carry out specific tasks. Kimbers inability to hire the appropriate consultants at the appropriate time could adversely impact Kimbers ability to advance its exploration activities. Certain Kimber directors also serve as officers and/or directors of other mineral resource companies, which may give rise to conflicts. Certain Kimber directors and officers are also directors, officers or shareholders of other companies that are similarly engaged in the business of acquiring, developing and exploiting natural resource properties. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. See ITEM 6. A. DIRECTORS SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES - Directors and Senior Management 23 Kimber will need to raise additional capital though the sale of its securities, resulting in dilution to the existing shareholders, and if such funding is not available, Kimbers operations would be adversely effected. Kimber does not generate any revenues from production and does not have sufficient financial resources to undertake by itself all of its planned exploration programs. Kimber has limited financial resources and has financed its operations primarily through the sale of Kimbers securities such as Common Shares. Kimber will need to continue its reliance on the sale of its securities for future financing, resulting in dilution to existing shareholders. Further exploration programs will depend on Kimbers ability to obtain additional financing which may not be available under favourable terms, if at all. If adequate financing is not available, Kimber may not be able to commence or continue with its exploration programs. Future sales of Kimbers Common Shares into the public market by holders of Kimber options and Warrants may lower the market price, which may result in losses to Kimbers shareholders. As of September 25, 2009 Kimber had 62,086,620 Common Shares issued and outstanding. In addition, as of September 25, 2009, 4,022,000 Common Shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, all of which may be exercised in the future resulting in dilution to Kimbers shareholders. Of these amounts, senior officers and directors of Kimber own, as a group, 5,685,956 Common Shares (9.16%), stock options to acquire an additional 3,010,000 Common Shares, and Warrants to acquire a further 32,541 Common Shares. Kimber may issue stock options to purchase an additional 752,362 Common Shares remaining under its existing stock option plan. Most of these Common Shares, including the Common Shares to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options, are freely tradable. In addition as of September 25, 2009 there were 4,000,000 outstanding Warrants to purchase Common Shares of Kimber at an exercise price of $1.25 per share. Also, as of September 25, 2009 there were 2,000,000 outstanding Warrants to purchase Common Shares of Kimber at an exercise price of $1.80 per share. Sales of substantial amounts of Kimbers Common Shares into the public market, by Kimbers officers or directors or pursuant to the exercise of options or Warrants, or even the perception by the market that such sales may occur, may lower the market price of its Common Shares. Kimber has no history of paying dividends, does not expect to pay dividends in the immediate future and may never pay dividends. Since incorporation, Kimber has not paid any cash or other dividends on its Common Shares and does not expect to pay such dividends in the foreseeable future, as all available funds will be invested primarily to finance its mineral exploration programs. Kimbers business involves risks for which Kimber may not be adequately insured, if it is insured at all. In the course of exploration, development and production of mineral properties, certain risks, and in particular, unexpected or unusual geological operating conditions including rock bursts, cave-ins, fires, flooding and earthquakes may occur. It is not always possible to fully insure against such risks. Kimber does not currently have insurance against all such risks and may decide not to take out insurance against all such risks as a result of high premiums or other reasons. Should such liabilities arise, they could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in increasing costs and a decline in the value of the securities of Kimber. 24 Kimbers activities are subject to environmental liability, which would have an adverse effect on its financial condition and operations. Kimber is not aware of any claims for damages related to any impact that its operations have had on the environment but it may become subject to such claims in the future. An environmental claim could adversely affect Kimbers business due to the high costs of defending against such claims and its impact on senior management's time. Also, environmental regulations may change in the future which could adversely affect Kimbers operations including the potential to curtail or cease exploration programs or to preclude entirely the economic development of a mineral property. The extent of any future changes to environmental regulations cannot be predicted or quantified, but it should be assumed that such regulations would become more stringent in the future. Generally, new regulations will result in increased compliance costs, including costs for obtaining permits, delays or fines resulting from loss of permits or failure to comply with the new regulations. A shortage of supplies and equipment could adversely affect Kimbers ability to operate its business. Kimber is dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out its operations. The shortage of such supplies, equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on Kimbers ability to carry out its operations and therefore have a material adverse effect on the cost of doing business. Risks For U.S. Holders U.S. investors may not be able to enforce their civil liabilities against Kimber or its directors and officers. It may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against Kimber which is incorporated and situated in the Province of British Columbia, Canada and does not have assets located in the United States. With the exception of three (3) directors who are residents of the United States, the officers and directors of Kimber are residents of British Columbia and Ontario, having all or a substantial portion of their assets located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for U.S. shareholders of Kimber to effect service of process on Kimber or these persons within the United States or to enforce judgements obtained in the United States based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against Kimber or its officers and most of its directors. In addition, U.S. shareholders of Kimber should not assume that the courts of Canada (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against Kimber, its officers or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United States, or (ii) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against Kimber, its officers or directors predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United States. As a foreign private issuer, Kimber shareholders may have less complete and timely data. Kimber is a foreign private issuer as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Equity securities of Kimber are accordingly exempt from Sections 14(a), 14(b), 14(c), 14(f) and 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 3a12-3 of the Exchange Act. Therefore, Kimber is not required to file a Schedule 14A proxy statement in relation to the annual meeting of shareholders. The submission of proxy and annual meeting of shareholder information on Form 6-K may result in shareholders having less complete and timely information in connection with shareholder actions. The exemption from Section 16 rules regarding reports of beneficial ownership and purchases and sales of Common Shares by insiders and restrictions on insider trading in our securities may result in shareholders having less data and there being fewer restrictions on insiders activities in Kimber securities. 25 Kimber believes it was a Passive Foreign Investment Company during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and may qualify as a Passive Foreign Investment Company in subsequent years, which could have negative consequences for U.S. investors. Potential investors who are U.S. taxpayers should be aware that Kimber believes that it was a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) for its most recent taxable year and based on current business plans and financial projections, may qualify as a PFIC in subsequent years. See Taxation-United States Federal Income Tax Consequence-Passive Foreign Investment Company. If Kimber is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. taxpayers holding period, then such U.S. taxpayer generally will be required to treat any so-called excess distribution received on its Common Shares, or any gain realized upon a disposition of Common Shares, as ordinary income and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such distribution or gain, unless the taxpayer makes a valid qualified electing fund (QEF) election or a mark-to-market election with respect to the Shares of Kimber. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exceed the amount of the excess distribution received, or the amount of proceeds of disposition realized, by the taxpayer. A U.S. taxpayer who makes a QEF election generally must report on a current basis its share of Kimbers net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which Kimber is a PFIC, whether or not Kimber distributes any amounts to its shareholders. A QEF election will only be effective if Kimber provides certain information to the U.S. holders. There can be no assurances Kimber can, or will comply with these requirements. A U.S. taxpayer who makes the mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the Common Shares over the taxpayers tax basis therein. If Kimber is (or has been) a PFIC and at any time has a non-U.S. corporate subsidiary that is a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally would be deemed to own, and also would be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to, their indirect ownership interests in any such lower-tier PFIC. A mark-to-market election under the PFIC rules with respect to Kimber would not apply to a lower-tier PFIC, and a U.S. Holder would not be able to make such an election with respect to its indirect ownership interest in any lower-tier PFIC. Differences in U.S. and Canadian reporting of Mineral Reserves and Resources Kimbers Mineral Reserve and Resource estimates are not directly comparable to those made in filings subject to SEC reporting and disclosure requirements, as Kimber generally reports Mineral Reserves and Resources in accordance with Canadian practices. These practices are different from those used to report Mineral Reserve and Resource estimates in reports and other materials filed with the SEC. It is Canadian practice to report Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, which are not permitted in disclosure filed with the SEC by United States issuers. In the United States, mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the Mineral Reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of Measured or Indi cated Mineral Resources will ever be converted into Mineral Reserves. Further, "Inferred Mineral Resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Disclosure of "contained ounces" is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC permits issuers to report "resources" only as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit of metal measures. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources contained in this Annual Report, or in the documents incorporated herein by reference, may not be comparable to information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. See GLOSSARY OF TERMS, ITEM 4. D. INFORMATION ON KIMBER Property, Plants, and Equipment - Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Resources, ITEM 4. D. INFORMATION ON KIMBER Property, Plants, and Equipment - The Monterde Property  Non-Reserves - Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources and Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. 26 Risks Related to Kimbers Common Shares For the financial year ending June 30, 2010 and for future financial years, Kimber will be required to obtain an auditors attestation on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, any adverse results from such attestation could result in a loss of investor confidence in its financial reports and have an adverse effect on the price of its Common Shares. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Kimber has furnished a report by management on Kimbers internal control over financial reporting in this Annual Report. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of Kimbers internal control over financial reporting, including a statement as to whether or not Kimbers internal control over financial reporting is effective. In future years, during the evaluation and testing process by Kimbers auditor, the auditor may identify one or more material weaknesses in Kimbers internal control over financial reporting, and the auditor will be unable to attest that such internal control is effective. If Kimbers auditor is unable to attest that Kimbers internal control over financial reporting is effective, Kimber could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on its Common Share price. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may make it more difficult for Kimber to obtain some insurance products, including director and officer liability insurance, and Kimber may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and/or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for Kimber to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors, on committees of its board of directors, or as executive officers.
