Item 1A. Risk Factors - ContinuedNegative press from the SEC inquiry and shareholder litigation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The negative press resulting from the SEC inquiry and shareholder litigation matters has harmed our reputation and could otherwise result in a loss of future business with our counterparties and business partners. It could also adversely affect the publicâ€™s perception of us and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with us. If our business partners and customers curtail their relationships with us, we could experience higher costs of doing business due to less favorable terms and/or the need to find alternative partners. There can be no assurance that our business partners and customers will not attempt to end or curtail their relationships with us.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone34Table of Contents
