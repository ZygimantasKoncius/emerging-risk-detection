D. Risk Factors The following risk factors, together with the other information and ILOGs Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto included elsewhere herein, should be carefully considered in evaluating ILOG and its business before making an investment decision with respect to ILOGs Shares or ADSs. Certain risk factors that affect the software industry generally and technology companies specifically also apply to ILOG. Such factors include: • increased competition for our products and services, including aggressive pricing strategies by competitors; • deferred purchases due to reduced capital investment; • a change in technological developments which are typified by rapid and unpredictable developments; • the effectiveness of our marketing and sales activities; • customer defaults could increase if there is a continued or worsening lack of credit or a significant economic downturn in the U.S., Europe or in Asia that leads to increased bankruptcy filings; • business disruptions due to fires, earthquakes, floods (our offices in France and in western California are located in potential earthquake and/or flood zones), and • theft of our intellectual property or confidential information. Any one or more of these circumstances could have an adverse impact on our business, operating revenues, financial results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 20-F will not result in problems that materially affect the financial aspects of our business and the price of our Shares and ADSs. In addition, there may be other risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial that may adversely affect our Company. 1. Risks relating to IBM public tender offers Our operations and operating income could be adversely affected by the potential acquisition by IBM. On July 28, 2008, the Company and IBM announced that they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding relating to the proposed acquisition of the Company by IBM, for the purpose of acquiring our shares and warrants via public tender offers in the United States and France (the Offers). The announcement was followed on August 26, 2008 by a filing with the AMF of a draft tender offer document by CITLOI, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM, and a draft response document by ILOG. The french offer was approved by the AMF on September 12, 2008 and the AMF approved the tender offer document of CITLOI and the response document of ILOG on such date. On October 14, 2008, CITLOI filed the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC and the Company filed the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The offers commenced on October 14, 2008 and are still ongoing at the time of the filing of this Form 20-F. The estimated amount of the offer is approximately 230 million euros (or approximately 330 millions US dollars on the basis of an exchange rate on September 30, 2008). The announcement of this transaction may affect the timing of our results (see Item 4.B  Seasonality) and/or could have a positive or negative impact on our revenues, if our clients accelerated or delayed, suspended, or abandoned their purchase decisions, until the transaction is completed, respectively. Current or potential clients could hesitate or decline to buy our products or services, due to competitive reasons or as a result of uncertainty tied to the future of our combined product lines with IBM products, and to the technical assistance and support for our current products. If the proposed acquisition were to lead a significant number of clients to delay their purchase decision, or to turn to another vendor, our earnings could be a dversely affected. The potential acquisition could also have repercussions on our revenues if our business partners terminate their relationship because, for example, they believe that IBM is a competitor, or they fear that we might no longer offer products that could operate independently (stand-alone products) if the acquisition were successfully completed. Finally, the time and expense of this acquisition and the uncertainties involved could distract the attention of our officers and employees away from management of the Company and encourage employees to leave the Company. Furthermore, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with this acquisition that will negatively impact our net income and financial condition, even if the offers are not completed. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 12 Back to Contents If the conditions mentioned in the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO of CITLOI, a subsidiary of IBM, and in the Memorandum of Understanding, are not met, the acquisition might not take place, and the price of our Shares and ADSs could decrease. The tender offer filed by CITLOI is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by CITLOI with the SEC on October 14, 2008 which present the conditions set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding. Among other things, CITLOI, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM, will not be required to proceed with the Offers unless it has the right to hold Shares (including those represented by ADSs) representing, at the closing of the Offers, at least 66.67% of the share capital and the voting rights of the Company on a fully-diluted basis. In addition, the offer is subject to antitrust clearance of the transaction by the European Commission under Article 6(1)(b) of the European Union Council Regulation (EEC) No. 139/2004. We cannot guarantee that all of these conditions will be met. In addition, under the provisions of Article 232-11 of the AMF General Regulations, and as described in the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO of CITLOI, the bidder may withdraw its offer: (i) within a period of five days following publication of the timetable of a competing offer or competing higher offer, and (ii) with the prior authorization of the AMF if the Company adopts, during the offer period, measures that modify the substance of the offer, or if the offer becomes irrelevant. If the acquisition were not completed, or if it were significantly delayed, the price of our Shares and ADSs could decrease to the level existing prior to the announcement of the offer, or significantly lower. The failure or delay of IBMs acquisition of us could have negative consequences on our future operations and transactions, as well as on the price of our Shares and ADSs. If the acquisition is not completed, or if it is delayed or withdrawn, we could suffer from a number of adverse consequences that could have a significant negative impact on our business, earnings and the price of our Shares and ADSs, specifically: • the additional work generated by the acquisition, and the uncertainties that it may involve, could lead to a decrease in revenues, and a weakening of our market position that we might not be able to recover from, if the transaction does not take place; • we could be ordered to pay IBM for breach of contract or a break-up fee amounting to €4 million if our Board of directors withdraws or modifies its recommendation regarding the Offers and/or recommends a tender offer from a third party or the tender offer in France is withdrawn pursuant to Article 232-11 of the AMF General Regulations; • we would be obligated to pay our own expenses relating to the acquisition, such as legal and auditors fees, and the fees of our financial advisors, which could be significant and result in a decrease in our net income; • we might not be in a position to take advantage from other market opportunities, or to react to pressures from competition; • the price of our Shares and ADSs could decline, to the extent that the current price of our Shares and ADSs has factored in the success of the acquisition; • we might not be able to retain the personnel that are indispensable to the success of our business; and • we might not be able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as a result of the departure of certain of our employees. The cash amount that shareholders will receive upon the completion of the Offers is based on a fixed amount per share and the price of the ADSs is subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Therefore, the premium relating to our Shares and ADSs price might decrease at the moment of their being tendered in connection with the Offers. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 13 Back to Contents According to the terms of the Offers, the Companys shareholders will receive 10 euros in cash per Share. ADS holders will receive an amount sum in dollars which, converted into euros, will be equal to 10 euros as of the date of the settlement and delivery under of the Offers. Given that the price per Share is fixed, the amount per Share that the Companys shareholders will receive will not change, even if our Share price does change. There will not be an adjustment of the price per Share, nor a right to withdraw the Offers solely because of fluctuations in the Companys Share price. Furthermore, ADS holders are subject to the risk of a decrease in the dollar/euro exchange rate before the closing of the Offers. In that case, the value offered in U.S. dollars for each ADS would decrease. Therefore, the price of the Companys Shares and ADSs during and following the closing of the Offers could be higher than the price at the moment of the Offers closing than their current price or their price at the time of there being tendered in connection with the Offers. 2. Risks concerning our ability to achieve financial results Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly as has the price of our Shares and ADSs and they may continue to do so in the future. Factors causing such fluctuations include: • varying demand for our products and services; • the size, timing and structure of significant license sales and/or royalty payments by customers; • cost overruns on fixed price consulting contracts and fluctuations in the profitability and losses associated with consulting contracts; • the growing complexity of our customers decision making processes; • the size of our consulting services staff, which may or may not track customer demand for our services and difficulties in quickly adjusting the size of the consulting staff in response to market demands which may fluctuate rapidly; • our periodic reliance on third party consultants to meet temporary increases in demand for our services, which results in lower service margins; • seasonality, particularly since a significant proportion of our sales come from Europe, where we generally realize lower revenues in the quarter ending September 30 than in the immediately preceding quarter due primarily to reduced economic activity in the summer months; • general economic conditions and customer spending on software and information technology products; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; • analyst expectations and analyst reports and recommendations; • stock market performance, particularly in the high-tech sector; • the timing of product announcements; and • a change in the competitive landscape due to competitors increased market share or introduction of a well regarded product. Revenues from license fees and/or royalties in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and on sales by the Companys independent software vendors, or ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), distributors and resellers. Our expenses are relatively fixed. Consequently, if revenue levels decline or are below expectations in any quarter, expense levels could be disproportionately high as a percentage of total revenues, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and could result in losses in that quarter. As a result, period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be unduly relied upon to predict future performance. In addition, if our operating results are below the expectations of investors and/or analysts, the price of our Shares and ADSs may fall. We generate all our revenues from three product lines. Any factor adversely affecting any of these product families could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. ILOGs business rules management system (BRMS), optimization and visualization product lines accounted for approximately 43%, 39% and 18% of our license and maintenance revenues in the 2008 fiscal year. We expect that revenues from each of these product lines will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total license and maintenance revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, any factors adversely affecting one or more of these product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 14 Back to Contents In addition, most of our professional services revenue is derived from the implementation of our BRMS products for new and existing customers. As a result, a decline in the demand for our software would result in a decline in the demand for our professional services. The financial industry is important to the deployment of our BRMS product line, especially for IT development of online orders and loan applications systems. The financial industry is subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks that may be influenced by unexpected events, such as the current sub-prime crisis in the United States and the global credit liquidity crisis and stock market declines, negatively impacting several parts of the financial markets. In 2008 fiscal year, the economic and financial conditions of the banking sector had a material negative impact on revenues generated by our BRMS product line (resulting in a 10% contraction of revenues expressed in euros, compared to 19% growth in the 2007 fiscal year for combined license and maintenance revenues). These conditions also had a negative impact on revenues generated by professional services associated with BRMS imple mentation for new and existing clients. If economic and financial conditions in the banking sector continue to deteriorate, we may experience an ongoing decline of BRMS revenues, which will negatively affect our financial results. In addition, during the 2008 fiscal year, the significant rise in oil price had a significant negative impact on the profitability of airline companies, which resulted in a decline in their purchase of information technology, including our products. If the surge of oil prices resumes, the negative impact on demand for our products could continue. We have attempted to increase our professional services revenue, which required us to hire more consultants and increased our overhead that may not be offset by actual professional service revenues, particularly during slow periods, which are unpredictable. In addition, our consulting services engagements are complex and require specific technical skills that we may or may not be able to provide due to competing engagements, which could result in lost revenues and lower than expected margins. In the 2007 and 2006 fiscal years, we significantly increased our professional services activity, which growth significantly slowed down in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the difficulties in the financial industry lowering the demand for ILOG services. As a result, demand for our services temporarily exceeded our internal capacity to staff the consulting engagements under contract, necessitating the hiring of additional third party consultants to fulfil such engagements. The hiring of these additional third party consultants could not be quickly reversed in the 2008 fiscal year in order to take into account the reduction of demand, and the gross profit on professional services significantly decreased during the 2008 financial year. On the last quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company succeeded in adjusting internal and external resources and managed to recover a gross profit margin above 20% . Third party consultants are more costly than the use of our staff consultants. As a result, costs relating to third party consultants represented 25% of total costs of professional services in the 2008 fiscal year and gross profit on professional services activities was 16% in the 2008 fiscal year compared to 22% in the 2007 fiscal year, reflecting the underutilization of our consultants in the 2008 fiscal year. The number of consulting engagements that we have can fluctuate at any given moment in time and is unpredictable. As a result, we cannot be assured that we will have sufficient work to keep our consultants engaged in fee-based projects on a full time basis, thereby potentially increasing our overhead without any corresponding increase in revenues, which could adversely impact our operating results and income. In addition, our professional services require highly technical and specific skills. Our ability to provide professional services has been constrained in the past, and may be constrained in the future, particularly when consultants with requisite skills are occupied on other engagements, which could result in lost revenues. In addition, due to the complex nature of our professional services, the actual margins we earn on professional services could be below the expectations at the outset of the en gagement, which could have a negative impact on our net income and the price of our Shares and ADSs. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 15 Back to Contents We have invested in certain vertical markets by developing industry specific products which may or may not yield any increase in profits, particularly due to the high cost of implementation which we provide at reduced prices as an inducement to the sale of these products. In fiscal year 2008, we continued our work to develop several new optimization products targeted to specific industries. Investments in new products and services are inherently speculative. The revenues we have received from these emerging products have not to date and may not in the future cover the associated development costs, some of which are still ongoing. Commercial success of new products depends on many factors, including our ability to execute our sales strategy with respect to these products, the commercial acceptance of these products by customers and the general economic conditions in these industries, particularly the semiconductor chip manufacturing, transportation and process manufacturing industries. Our current strategy involves absorbing some of the implementation costs as an inducement to the sale of these products. We recently decided to scale back on the fixed cost components of two of the three vertical products we have in development. We cannot be assured that these products will become commercially viable, or will ever achieve profitability. The industry in which we operate is characterized by intense competition and consolidation and collaboration in our industry could further increase competition significantly and result in fewer customer orders, price reductions, reduced transaction sizes, reduced profits and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and we expect product and service offerings and pricing competition to increase. We compete with a number of private and public companies in our individual product lines, however, we do not believe we have any competitor across all three of our product lines. Our competitors include, without limitation, by product line: (i) Business Rule Management Systems: Computer Associates, Corticon Technologies, Fair Isaac, Haley, Microsoft, Pegasystems and Red Hat; (ii) optimization: Cosytec, Dash Associates (now part of Fair Isaac) and SAS; (iii) visualization: Infragistics, SL Corporation and Tom Sawyer. The optimization product line includes supply chain management software applications for which Infor is also a competitor. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical and ma rketing resources, greater name recognition, broader product offerings and a larger installed base of customers than we do. In addition, some of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to develop, promote and sell their products and may be able to offer products cheaper than us. We also face increased competition from companies such as Red Hat, or software developer communities who provide software with some of the functionalities provided in our Rules products on an open source or free basis. In addition, we encounter competition from low cost companies in India, China and other countries, and we compete with companies that provide packaged software with respect to specific applications. In addition, virtually all of our customers have significant investments in their own existing solutions and have the resources necessary to enhance existing products and to develop future products. These customers have or may develop and incorporate competing technologies into their systems, thereby replacing our current or proposed components. This would eliminate their need for our services and components and limit future opportunities. We are, therefore, required t o persuade development personnel within these customer organizations to outsource the development of their software and to provide products and solutions to these customers that cost-effectively compete with their internally developed products. Barriers to entry in our business are generally low and the software industry is currently undergoing consolidation as software companies seek to offer more extensive suites and broader arrays of software products, as well as integrated software and hardware solutions. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current and prospective customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. If one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, we could face significantly increased competition. Competitors and potential competitors could also seek to invest in the development of technologies and solutions internally t hat compete with our products and services. New or enhanced products introduced by existing or future competitors could increase the competition faced by our products. Furthermore, companies larger than us could enter the market through internal expansion or by strategically aligning themselves with one of our competitors and may be able to offer cheaper products than us. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future distributors, resellers, original equipment manufacturers or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to sell through these channels and reducing promotion of our products. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 16 Back to Contents The ongoing market consolidation and/or increased competition resulting from a combination of our competitors or a competitors successful product development or collaboration with our sales partners could result in fewer customer orders, price reductions, reduced transaction sizes, reduced profits and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. See Item 4.B.  Our markets and Competition. The fact that our products require significant implementation costs contributes to the extended length and variability of our sales cycle and we often experience a concentration of transactions in the final weeks of a quarter, which could result in substantial fluctuations in operating results and cause the price of our Shares and ADSs to decline. Because of the horizontal or generic nature of the functionality of our software components, additional development to fit customers particular industries is required. Our vertical products also require significant implementation costs to enable them to work with customers particular operational parameters and requirements. For our customers that are trying to automate very complex problems, the additional development/customization process can prove difficult and expensive, and therefore purchasing decisions are sometimes difficult to predict and capture accurately in our forecasts. Our sales cycle is generally three to six months or longer and varies substantially from customer to customer. As a result, a large number of our software license agreements are consummated in the weeks immediately preceding a quarter end. Our customers are often cautious in making decisions to acquire our products because purchasing our products may involve shifts by the customer to a new software platform or a change in the customers operational procedures. Delays in completing sales and changes in the amount of expected customer orders can arise while customers complete their internal procedures to approve purchase expenditures and test and accept our products. In addition, we have been constrained in the past, and we may be constrained in the future, in our ability to provide professional services due to a lack of resources, which may cause software license sales cycles to be lengthened or re sult in the loss of software license sales. The nature and length of the sales cycle for our products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. We also face difficulty predicting the amount of expected sales and the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur due to the nature and length of the sales cycle for our products. In addition, the complexity of our professional services engagements can result in delayed deliverables or milestones, resulting in delayed receipt of revenues. We rely on forecasted revenues for planning and modeling our earnings guidance before actual sales are consummated. Forecasts, however, are only estimates and actual results may vary for a particular quarter or longer periods of time. Consequently, significant potential discrepancies between actual and forecasted results could limit our ability to plan, budget or provide accurate earnings and profitability guidance, which could adversely affect the price of our Shares and ADSs. Any publicly-stated revenue or earnings projections are subject to this risk. Our business involves more professional services engagements on a fixed price basis than we have undertaken in prior years which presents the risk that the work product may not be accepted when finally delivered and therefore we may not be paid for our time or the cost of the engagement may be more than we receive in revenues. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 17 Back to Contents We are not able to precisely assess the risk relating to fixed price engagements. The number of such contracts is not currently significant, but has been increasing in recent years. If the customer does not accept all or part of the work product that we deliver, we may not receive some or all of the anticipated revenues to offset the costs incurred in performing the engagement, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues, net profit and financial condition. In addition, the risks associated with these engagements include the possibility that we could poorly manage the engagement and not conduct the work in the most cost effective manner. Further, we could underestimate the amount of work that will be required and the engagement could actually result in a loss. Moreover, we could lose other more profitable opportunities because we are required to commit significant resources to a given professional services engagements which may turn out to be unprofitable. We are dependent upon certain major ISVs for a significant part of our revenues. In fiscal year 2008, approximately 16% of our revenues were generated from ISVs which embedded our software components in their applications, which they in turn sell to their customers. In fiscal year 2008, our two largest customers were IBM and SAP A.G., ISVs, that provided 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, of our revenues, and revenues from the eight next largest customers, after IBM and SAP, of which two were ISVs, accounted for a further approximately 1.4% of our revenues. If any or all of the ISVs decided for any reason to replace our components with their own or a competitors technology, discontinued offering any of the applications embedding our components and/or experienced a business downturn, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. 3. Risks that could adversely affect our business operations Our ability to acquire, develop and market new products and product enhancements needs to be timely and directed to changing market and technological requirements or our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. We operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Accordingly, our future success will depend in large part on our ability to improve our current technologies and to acquire, develop and market new products and product enhancements that address changing market and technological requirements on a timely basis. The development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Furthermore, investments in new technology are inherently speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, our ability to execute our sales strategy with respect to these products, the commercial acceptance of these products by custo mers and general economic conditions in the different countries in which we sell our products and in our customers industries. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring, developing and marketing new products or product enhancements, that we will not experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful acquisition, development, introduction or marketing of such products or enhancements or that any new products or product enhancements will adequately address market and technological requirements and achieve market acceptance. As it is customary in the software industry, we have in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products and features, and we may experience such delays in the future. As a result, revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and services may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to integrate acquired products, or develop new products or enhancements to existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, the Companys business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. If our professional services activities fall below customer expectations, we could lose customers or be required to reimburse customers for license and service fees paid to us. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 18 Back to Contents In fiscal year 2008, approximately 27% of our revenues were directly provided by our professional services which are designed to facilitate customer adoption of our products, and accelerate their deployment, so that further license and maintenance revenues can be generated for us. If our professional services fail to meet or satisfy customer expectations, we could lose customers and we may be required to reimburse customers for license and service fees paid to us. Currency fluctuations could result in lower profitability for us in euro terms and the reporting of exchange losses. We operate on a multinational basis and a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the euro, our financial reporting currency for the financial statements included in this annual report. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the euro have caused and will continue to cause euro translated amounts to vary from one period to another. Approximately 46% of our sales revenues and 36% of our operating expenses in fiscal year 2008 were denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remainder in euros and, to a lesser extent, other currencies. An increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar will result in lower profitability in euro terms assuming no change in revenue and cost structure. See Item 5  Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Also, currency exchange rate movements of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables recorded by the Company and each of its subsidiaries, including their respective inter-company accounts, result in the reporting of realized and unrealized exchange gains or losses in our income statement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the constantly changing currency exposures and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results. In order to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into foreign exchange derivative financial instruments to protect against foreign currency rate improvements relative to the euro for anticipated cash flows from transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries. While we have a policy of hedging our short-term currency exposures associated with anticipated cash flo ws from transactions with subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than the euro, there can be no assurance that this policy will be successful and/or properly executed. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States, France, and in certain other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, by our ability to generate taxable income in foreign jurisdictions in order to utilize foreign tax losses, and by the valuation of our deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, but there can be no assurance that our assessments will be deemed accurate by one or more of the taxing authorities to which we are subject in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Errors in our software products could result in warranty or product liability claims against us. The software products we offer are inherently complex. Software products frequently contain undetected errors or failures, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Despite our preliminary testing and use by current and potential customers, errors may not be detected in our products and product upgrades which may require us to refund license and maintenance fees paid or to pay damages. Persistent or pervasive problems with undetected errors or failures could negatively affect our reputation in the industry. Our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability and other claims due to unforeseen or undetected errors. It is possible, however, that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements, especially unsigned shrink-wrap licenses, may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions. A product liability claim, whether or not successful, could be time-consuming and costly and thus could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations or financial position. In addition, we sometimes grant our customers longer than normal warranty periods or provide additional non-standard warranties. We currently have limited insurance against product liability risks or errors and omissions coverage, and there can be no assurance that the current levels of insurance coverage we do have are ade quate or that additional insurance would be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 19 Back to Contents The loss of services of any of our key personnel could have a materially adverse impact on our business. Our future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical, sales and senior management personnel, including, Pierre Haren, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, known in France as the Président Directeur Général. We are also particularly dependent upon our technical personnel with expertise in object oriented technology, math programming and artificial intelligence technology. Our recently announced acquisition with IBM could cause key personnel to leave our employment even if the acquisition is not successful, which would negatively impact our business. Our future success will depend on our ability to train, motivate and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Competition for such personnel is intense, especially for technical personnel of the quality of our software architects and scientists. If we were to lose the services of our key technical, sales or senior management personnel or were unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in the future our business could be adversely impacted in a material manner. As a result of our global operations, we are exposed to numerous risks, including logistical difficulties, cultural differences, product localization costs, import and tariff restrictions, adverse foreign tax consequences and fluctuations in currencies. Our engineering and research and development operations are located primarily in France, except for our CPLEX products, which are developed in Incline Village, Nevada, and Sunnyvale, California, and our recently acquired LogicTools products, which are developed in Eugene, Oregon. We expect that a limited amount of research and development work on our existing products will be performed by our office in Shangaï, China. Our sales and marketing operations are located on four continents. These varied locations and the inter-related activities of these groups have in the past led, and in the future could lead, to logistical and communication difficulties. Further, our global operations may be directly affected by adverse economic, health and geopolitical conditions in the countries where we do business. Approximately 46%, 45% and 10% of our revenues in fiscal year 2008 were from North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, respectively. Worldwide operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations; • fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates; • potentially adverse tax consequences; • the costs of localizing products for different countries; • longer accounts receivable collection periods in certain geographic regions, especially Europe, and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; • dependence on different independent resellers; • dependence on different technology standards; • import and export restrictions and tariffs; • difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; • political instability; • disease and related quarantines; • more stringent labor laws, boycotts and/or strikes; • the burdens of complying with multiple, potentially conflicting laws; • the impact of localized business cycles; and • regional economic conditions, cyclicality and instability. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 20 Back to Contents 4. Risks associated with our proprietary technology Intellectual property infringement disputes could cause us significant expense and divert technical and management personnel. There can be no assurance that we will not receive communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe, or may infringe, on their proprietary rights. We cannot prevent third parties from claiming intellectual property infringement against us. We have been subject to such claims in the past. For instance, in fiscal year 2003, a third party asserted that a feature of our ILOG Solver product infringed their patent. We vigorously contested this assertion as being without merit and while we did not change our position in this regard, we reached an agreement to amicably resolve the matter in a manner that had no material financial impact for the Company. In addition, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation to determine the validity of any claims could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks, whether or not such litigation was determined in our favor. As the number of software products in our own industry increases outside of Europe and the functionality of these products further overlap, we believe that software companies may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any such claims against us, with or without merit, as well as claims we initiate against third parties, could be time consuming and expensive to defend or prosecute and difficult to resolve, and could result in product shipment delays. In the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation, we might be required to pay substantial damages, discontinue the use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology or face increased competition from other products. There can be no assurance that licenses to such technology would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.< /P> We depend heavily on our proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop similar technologies that directly compete with our proprietary technology or that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. We also license our products primarily in object code form, which does not allow our customers access to our source code. Source code is the form in which our proprietary technology is most vulnerable to theft, copying or misappropriation. See Item 4.B.  Proprietary Rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, other companies could seek to design around our proprietary technology and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy, use or make copies of our products or aspects thereof, or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult. In addition, the laws of many jurisdictions do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of France and the U.S. In particular, shrink-wrap licenses may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and copyright and trade secret protection for software may be unavailable in certain countries. Under current EU intellectual property laws, software does not benefit from patent protection. Consequently, we rely primarily on the copyright laws of the U.S. and France to protect our proprietary rights. We currently have one pending patent application in Japan, jointly filed with Mitsubishi Chemical Kabushiki Kaisha, one U.S. patent entitled Interactive Generation of Graphical Visualizations of Large Data Structures, and five pending utility patent applications in the U.S. with titles as follows: Method and System for Optimizing Mixed Integer Programming Solutions; Method and System for Optimizing Business Process Management Using Mathematical Programming Techniques; Method and System for Identifying Conflicting Constraints in Mixed Integer Programs; Method and System for Applying Evolutionary Search to Generate Robust Search Strategies; and Method and System for Sequential Compilation and Execution of Rules. We cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our pending or any future patent applications. Furthermore, these and any other patents we obtain in the future may be circumvented, challenged, invalidated or desig ned around by other companies. The objective impossibility to adequately protect our intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect our business and competitive position, operating results and financial condition. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 21 Back to Contents 5. Risks relating to business combinations and investments Past and future acquisitions and minority investments may result in additional liabilities or risks for the Company or the dilution of holders of our Ordinary Shares and ADSs or earnings per Share and ADS. Our business strategy has included, among other things, seeking to acquire or making minority investments in companies with complementary product lines, technologies or businesses. Such acquisitions and investments could potentially result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and write-offs related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our profitability. Were we to pursue one or more acquisitions in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate such transactions, achieve the expected rates of return, integrate the acquired assets and business or the acquired companies employees successfully into our working environment, and/or retain either our or the acquired companies key employees. Similarly, investments in minority interests may not achieve our expected rates of return and are subject to a dditional risks, including a lack of control or ability to implement our preferred strategies at such companies whose strategies and interests may differ from ours. Such acquisitions and minority investments could also create product liability issues, and could result in a significant diversion of management attention away from the day to day operations of the Company, or result in significant acquisition costs that may not be recovered if the transaction is not completed. In addition, acquisitions and minority investments can result in a dilution of the position of our existing shareholders and our earnings per Share and ADS if we used Shares to make acquisitions or investments, as well as result in unanticipated legal risks and costs, and liabilities. Limitations imposed by French law and our by‑laws may prevent or delay an acquisition by ILOG using its Shares. As a French company listed on the Euronext Paris stock market, we are subject to certain requirements not generally applicable to corporations organized in the U.S. For example, our shareholders are subject to voting procedures that are more complicated than for U.S. companies generally. Shareholder approval at an extraordinary shareholders meeting must be obtained for any new Shares issued in connection with a business combination, even if we are the surviving entity, or for an acquisition of assets in exchange for our shares. The presence, at such a meeting, in person or by proxy, of shareholders holding one-fourth of the voting Shares upon first notice, and one-fifth of the voting Shares upon second notice, is required for a quorum. The increasing practice of U.S. shareholders not to exercise their voting rights may prevent us from obtaining a quorum for such a meeting and thus impair our abil ity to obtain shareholder approval for acquisitions, mergers and/or corporate reorganizations. 6. Other risks of owning ILOG Shares and ADSs Changes in accounting principles may affect our reported earnings and operating income. Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as revenue recognition for software and treatment of goodwill, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules, their interpretation, or changes in our products or business could significantly change our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Holders of ADSs may be subject to additional risks related to holding ADSs rather than Shares. Because holders of ADSs do not hold their Shares directly, they are subject to the following additional risks: • fluctuations in the exchange rate for converting euros into U.S. dollars may affect the value of ADSs. Specifically, if the relative value of the euro against the U.S. dollar declines, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro trading prices of Shares on Euronext and the trading price of ADSs in the United States would decline; the U.S. dollar equivalent of the proceeds that a holder of ADSs would receive upon the sale in France of any Shares withdrawn from the Depositary and the U.S. dollar equivalent of any cash dividends paid in euros on the Shares represented by ADSs would also decline; 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 22 Back to Contents • in the event of a dividend or other distribution, if exchange rates fluctuate during any period of time when the Depositary cannot convert euros into U.S. dollars, the ADS holder may lose some or all of the value of the distribution. There can be no assurance that the Depositary will be able to convert any currency at a specified exchange rate or sell any property, rights, shares or other securities at a specified price, or that any of such transactions can be completed within a specified time period; • in order to vote at general shareholders meetings, ADS holders who are not registered on the books of the Depositary are required to transfer their ADSs a certain number of days before a general shareholders meeting into a blocked account established for that purpose by the Depositary. Any ADS transferred to this blocked account will not be available for transfer during that time. ADS holders who are registered on the books of the Depositary must give instructions to the Depositary not to transfer their ADSs during this period before the general shareholders meeting. ADS holders must therefore receive voting materials from the Depositary sufficiently in advance in order to make these transfers or give these instructions. There can be no guarantee that ADS holders will receive voting materials in time to instruct the Depositary to vote. It is pos sible that ADS holders, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote at all; • ADS holders may not receive copies of all reports from the Depositary or us in a timely manner or at all; and • the Depositary and we may amend or terminate the Deposit Agreement without ADS holders’ consent in a manner that could prejudice ADS holders. Limitations imposed by French law and our by‑laws could prevent an acquisition of us. French law requires any person, acting alone or in concert, who comes to own more than 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, one-third, one-half, two-thirds, 90% or 95% of our outstanding shares or voting rights, or whose shares or voting rights fall below any of these percentages, to inform us and the AMF within five trading days of crossing the applicable threshold percentage. A person acquiring, alone or in concert, more than 10% or 20% of our share capital or voting rights must include in the report a statement of the persons intentions relating to future acquisitions or participation in the management of our company for the following 12-month period. Shareholders who fail to comply with these requirements may be deprived of voting rights for a period of up to five years and may, in some cases, be subject to fines. Under AMF regulations, and subject to limited exemptions granted by the AMF, any person, act ing alone or in concert, who comes to own more than one third of our share capital or voting rights, must initiate a public tender offer. In addition, French labor laws generally impose an obligation on an entity acquiring a business or product line to assume the role of employer for the French employees affiliated with the business or product line being acquired, and unlike in other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the Companys French employees have contractual and legal rights to continued employment post acquisition. This may make it difficult or serve as a deterrent for an international entity with no presence in France to acquire our Company or one of our product lines. It may not be possible for shareholders to effect service of legal process, enforce judgments of courts outside of France or bring actions based on securities laws of jurisdictions other than France against ILOG, its executive officers or directors. ILOG and a majority of its executive officers and directors are residents of France and other countries other than the United States. In addition, many of the assets of ILOG and such persons are located in whole or in substantial part outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for shareholders to effect service of legal process within the United States upon us or most of these persons, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, judgments of U.S. courts, including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be enforceable in French courts. As a result, our shareholders who obtain a judgment against us or such persons in the United States may not be able to require us or such persons to pay the amount of the judgment. 2007/2008 FORM 20-F | ILOG | 23 Back to Contents
