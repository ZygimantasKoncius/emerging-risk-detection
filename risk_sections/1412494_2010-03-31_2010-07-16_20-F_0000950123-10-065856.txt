Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business and IndustryFluctuations in our clients annual IT budget and spending cycle and other factors can cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Operating Results Revenues For the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we generated total revenues of $65.9 million, $106.3 million, and $169.1 million, respectively. We currently derive our revenues from two sources: software development and other services. Software development revenues consist of revenues from the sale of software, assistance in implementation and customization of that software, and PCS. Other services revenues include revenues from ATM maintenance services and ancillary services. Due to our customers contracting and purchasing practices, we do not have a significant amount of software development backlog at any time such that our software development backlog at any one time would be typically less than the next three months revenue. 43 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the revenues generated by each of the two sources: Year Ended March 31, 2008 March 31, 2009 March 31, 2010 % of Total % Changes % of Total % Changes % of Total % Changes Revenues Revenues from 2006 Revenues Revenues from 2008 Revenues Revenues from 2009 ($ in thousands, except percentages) Revenues by source: Software Development 55,147 83.7 % 67.6 % 89,559 84.3 % 62.4 % 145,200 85.9 % 62.1 % Other Services 10,769 16.3 % 10.5 % 16,737 15.7 % 55.4 % 23,857 14.1 % 42.5 % Total Revenue 65,916 100.0 % 54.6 % 106,296 100.0 % 61.3 % 169,057 100.0 % 59.0 % Software Development Software development revenues constituted 83.7%, 84.3% and 85.9% of our total revenues for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Categorization of software development revenues Our software development revenues can be categorized by:  development methodology,  type of solutions and services, and  client type. Development Methodology. Depending on the development methodology, our software solutions can be categorized as custom-designed software and standardized software. We also enter into stand-alone maintenance contracts for a portion of our custom-designed software covering the period after the initial PCS period has expired, with this revenue recorded as software maintenance.  Custom-designed software development. We provide a broad range of custom-designed software development services primarily to large banks and insurance companies. These projects usually take approximately six months to complete and involve design and implementation of new solutions or significant customization of our software and, in some cases, third party software to meet our clients needs. We typically receive a lump sum fee payable according to negotiated payment schedules. Each projects fee is based on our assessment of the man-hours involved, the size and complexity of the project, competitive pressure, strategic value of the project, cross-selling opportunities and our relationship with the client. The contract value less amounts deferred for the provision of bundled PCS services based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, is recognized as revenue over the customization and implementation period using the percentage of completion method based on the efforts expended. We recognize the deferred PCS portion of the contract value on a straight-line basis over the PCS term, which is normally one year.  Standardized software development. We leverage our customized-software development efforts, including the related platforms, modules and elements, and our internal research and development efforts to develop standardized software solutions. We made our first significant sales in 2003. Our standardized solutions do not require significant customization and require limited implementation time, generally one to two months. Compared to similar custom-designed solutions, the price of standardized solutions does not vary significantly. Our standardized solutions typically include PCS, normally for one year. Since we do not have VSOE for standardized software arrangements, costs related to PCS are insignificant and the PCS period is no more than one year, we recognize the entire contract value upon customer acceptance. In determining their IT spending with us, our clients purchase our solutions based on the functionality offered and not on whether the solution is customized or standardized. Consequently, we elect to provide a customized or standardized offering based on our software development status. We prefer to deliver a standardized solution where possible as standardized solutions command pricing similar to customized solutions with significantly less customization and implementation requirements. However, our suites of standardized solutions are limited, take time to develop and can become outdated over time. 44 Table of Contents When addressing for the first time a specific IT need, we normally first develop a custom- designed solution. In some cases, through our own research and development activities or additional modifications to the customized solution, we are able to develop a standardized solution available for sale to other clients. Our decision to develop a standardized solution is based on our assessment of whether sufficient broader market demand exists for that solution and the level of additional customization required implementing the solution for different clients. A typical standardized software solution normally takes one to two years to develop. Once developed, a standardized solution replaces custom development revenues for that solution for one to two years until the standardized solution itself becomes outdated, due to banking systems changes or changes in market requirements. At that time, the development cycle begins again and we offer clients a customized solution or we need to start developing through our own research and development activities a new product. We are currently developing our next suite of standardized solutions. We expect to rely on our customized software solutions and to a lesser extent standardized solutions for revenue growth given the lead-times to either develop or improve customized solutions into a standardized solution and uncertainties around whether a particular customized solution can be developed into a standardized solution.  Software maintenance. In addition to our standard PCS, we offer stand-alone maintenance contracts, primarily for the custom-designed solutions, typically for a one-year period and renewable annually. Revenues from software maintenance are recognized ratably over the contract service period. The table below sets forth our revenues categorized based on development methodology for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively: Year Ended March 31, 2008 March 31, 2009 March 31, 2010 % of % of % of Applicable % Changes Applicable % Changes Applicable % Changes Revenues Revenues from 2006 Revenues Revenues from 2008 Revenues Revenues from 2009 ($ in thousands, except percentages) Software Development Revenue by development methodology: Customized 32,183 58.3 % 141.6 % 58,282 65.1 % 81.1 % 93,262 64.2 % 60.0 % Standardized 18,007 32.7 % 4.2 % 28,219 31.5 % 56.7 % 44,719 30.8 % 58.5 % Maintenance 4,957 9.0 % 116.0 % 3,058 3.4 % (38.3 %) 7,219 5.0 % 136.1 % Total software development 55,147 100.0 % 67.6 % 89,559 100.0 % 62.4 % 145,200 100.0 % 62.1 % Type of Software Solutions. Our software solutions can be broadly classified as: channel-related, business-related, management-related, and business intelligence. Our business intelligence software solutions focus on supporting banks decision making processes. The table below sets forth our revenues from these solution categories: Year Ended March 31, 2008 March 31, 2009 March 31, 2010 % of % of % of Applicable % Changes Applicable % Changes Applicable % Changes Revenues Revenues from 2006 Revenues Revenues from 2008 Revenues Revenues from 2009 ($ in thousands, except percentages) Software Development Revenue by solution type: Channel 8,763 15.9 % 10.4 % 10,878 12.1 % 24.1 % 13,864 9.5 % 27.4 % Business 11,379 20.6 % 52.6 % 14,652 16.4 % 28.8 % 22,240 15.3 % 51.8 % Management 18,744 34.0 % 78.3 % 36,205 40.4 % 93.2 % 55,774 38.4 % 54.1 % Business Intelligence 15,308 27.8 % 380.3 % 27,575 30.8 % 80.1 % 53,089 36.6 % 92.5 % Others 953 1.7 % (75.0 %) 249 0.3 % (73.9 %) 233 0.2 % (6.4 %) Total software development 55,147 100.0 % 67.6 % 89,559 100.0 % 62.4 % 145,200 100.0 % 62.1 % As our clients sought to improve their internal systems, they invested more in management-related software solutions and services, which accounted for 34.0%, 40.4% and 38.4% of our total software development revenues in the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Management-related solutions generated revenue of $18.7 million, $36.2 million and $55.8 million in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Management-related solutions include solutions for enterprise resource management and credit and risk management. As the market matures and we face greater competition, we do not expect our future growth rates for these solutions to be as high as our historical growth rates. 45 Table of Contents Beginning in 2005, our clients sought to improve their data mining and data analysis capabilities by implementing better business intelligence systems. Our revenues from business intelligence solutions constituted 27.8%, 30.8% and 36.6% of our total software development revenues during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Business intelligence solutions generated revenue of $15.3 million, $27.6 million and $53.1 million, in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The demand for business intelligence was driven by our customers building out data warehouses and business intelligence applications to conduct business and decision-making analysis in order to better understand their customers behavior and the effectiveness of their products. We expect business intelligence solutions to be one of our highest growth areas in fiscal 2011. Client Type. We provide software solutions and post-implementation solution support services primarily to leading financial institutions, insurance companies and enterprises in China. Our software development revenues can be categorized by our four different client types which are Big Four Banks, Other Banks, insurance clients and enterprises. The Big Four Banks category includes the four largest state banks in China which are the Agriculture Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank. Other Banks excludes the Big Four Banks and includes national commercial banks, policy banks, city banks, rural credit unions and China Post Bank. Our Insurance clients include both property and life insurance providers in China. Enterprises are entities not involved in financial services and include government entities and large state enterprises. Excluding PCS, our contracts for providing software development services are generally less than one year. Our contracts for providing stand-alone maintenance services are generally for one year, renewable on an annual basis. When dealing with Big Four Bank clients we sign contracts with both the head office and branches. However, we expect revenue contribution from sales to Big Four Bank clients to decrease as a percentage of our revenues and believe our future growth will be increasingly attributed to growth in sales to Other Banks, insurance clients and enterprises. The following table sets forth our software development revenues by client: Year Ended March 31, 2008 March 31, 2009 March 31, 2010 % of % of % of Applicable % Changes Applicable % Changes Applicable % Changes Revenues Revenues from 2006 Revenues Revenues from 2008 Revenues Revenues from 2009 ($ in thousands, except percentages) Software Development Revenue by client: Big Four Banks 27,482 49.7 % 5.2 % 42,002 46.9 % 52.8 % 63,092 43.5 % 50.2 % Other Banks 17,648 32.1 % 216.7 % 34,563 38.6 % 95.8 % 54,168 37.3 % 56.7 % Insurance 5,401 9.8 % 1,250.3 % 9,854 11.0 % 82.4 % 21,830 15.0 % 121.5 % Enterprises 4,616 8.4 % 481.4 % 3,140 3.5 % (32.0 %) 6,110 4.2 % 94.6 % Total software development 55,147 100.0 % 67.6 % 89,559 100.0 % 62.4 % 145,200 100.0 % 62.1 % Factors affecting our software development revenues Our revenues from software development and operating results are significantly affected by the following factors: Mix of software sales. Our revenue growth during fiscal 2010 was driven by both customized and standardized revenue growth. Our revenue from customized software solutions increased 60.0% from $58.3 million in fiscal 2009 to $93.3 million in fiscal 2010. Sysnet contributed $5.2 million to our customized software revenue in fiscal 2010. Other than Sysnet, customized revenue increased 51.1%. Our revenue from standardized software solutions increased 58.5% from $28.2 million in fiscal 2009 to $44.7 million in fiscal 2010. Our maintenance revenue increased 136.1% from $3.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $7.2 million in fiscal 2010 due to a larger installed product base as well as the acquisition of Sysnet, which contributed $1.5 million in maintenance revenue. Other than Sysnet, maintenance revenue increased 87.7%. Standardized software solutions as a percentage of software development revenues were 32.7%, 31.5% and 30.8% for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively and most of the growth has been organic. As standardized software involves significantly less development and implementation time while commanding similar prices, the increased standardized software sales increase our gross margin and allow us to more efficiently utilize our software development, delivery and sales resources. 46 Table of Contents From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 our revenue growth was driven primarily by customized revenue growth. Compared to fiscal 2008 our customized software solution revenues in fiscal 2009 grew 81.1% from $32.2 million to $58.3 million. In contrast, our standardized software solution revenues grew by 56.7%, from $18.0 million in fiscal 2008 to $28.2 million in fiscal 2009. Customized software solutions revenues represented 65.1% of software development revenues for fiscal 2009 compared to 58.3% for fiscal 2008. The increase in the customized revenue mix was due to a number of factors including the growth in our business intelligence solutions, mainly sold as a customized solution and the fastest growing area for Longtop, and solutions for the insurance sector which at this time are mainly sold as a customized solution. In fiscal 2008, we began focusing on Other Banks and insurance clients and delivered them a customized solution as we did not have standardized solutions available.  Ability to anticipate need for and develop relevant solutions. Our continued revenue growth depends on our ability to timely anticipate and respond to market demand for software solutions meeting the needs of Chinas financial institutions. Recently, our highest growth area has been our business management and business intelligence software solutions. As noted above, we expect this trend to continue as our clients seek to improve their data mining and data analysis capabilities. Our other solutions are more mature and we expect they will continue to grow, but at slower rates.  Addition and retention of clients. The retention and growth of our existing key clients and the addition of new clients contribute to our revenue growth by providing a growing market for our solutions and by expanding cross-selling opportunities. A significant portion of our revenues are generated from sales to Big Four Bank clients. We plan to continue to diversify our client base of financial institutions and increase our sales to more national and city commercial banks and insurance companies, while maintaining the sales to our existing key clients. We also plan to sell some of our treasury function and financial control solutions to companies in other industries, including the tobacco, automobile and oil industry. As we diversify our client base, our aggregate revenues and percentage contributions of revenues from Big Four Bank clients may decline.  Seasonality. Most financial industry clients plan and budget for their IT investment on an annual basis in the last quarter of each calendar year and do not finalize their annual budget until the first quarter of the following calendar year. Also, the Chinese New Year holiday typically falls between late January and February of each year. As a result, relatively few contracts are signed in the first calendar quarter, with an increase in the second calendar quarter and with most of our contracts getting signed and completed in the third and fourth calendar quarters. These factors result in the first and second calendar year quarters generally being our lowest revenue quarters. Due to the annual budget cycles of most of our clients, effective April 1, 2007, we changed our fiscal year end to March 31 in order to better estimate demand for our solutions and services in a given fiscal year. Other Services. Other services revenues include revenues from the ATM maintenance services segment and the ancillary services segment, consisting of system integration services and other miscellaneous services. These revenues constituted 16.3%, 15.7% and 14.1% of our total revenues for the years ended March 31 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We recognize these revenues as the services are performed or ratably over the contract period. Contract periods are typically within one year. Other services revenue is not a growth business for us and we believe that our other services revenue will increase at substantially lower rates than our software development revenue. 47 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our cost of revenues and operating expenses, both as an absolute amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated. Year Ended March 31, 2008 2009 2010 % % % ($ in thousands, except percentages) Total revenues 65,916 100.0 106,296 100.0 169,057 100.0 Cost of revenues: Software development 21,138 32.1 26,294 24.7 45,880 27.1 Other services 4,517 6.9 10,123 9.5 17,465 10.3 Total cost of revenues 25,655 39.0 36,417 34.2 63,345 37.4 Gross profit 40,261 61.0 69,879 65.8 105,712 62.6 Operating expenses: Research and development 3,838 5.8 5,172 4.9 8,219 4.9 Sales and marketing 10,393 15.8 10,961 10.3 20,966 12.4 General and administrative 19,633 29.8 9,359 8.8 13,983 8.3 Impairment of Goodwill  0.0  0.0 1,982 1.2 Total operating expenses 33,864 51.4 25,492 24.0 45,150 26.8 Income from operations 6,397 9.6 44,387 41.8 60,562 35.8 Cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues includes costs directly attributable to our software development and other services.  Software development costs. These consist of costs for the design, implementation, delivery and maintenance of our software solutions and amortization of intangibles related to our software development revenues. Software development costs are primarily headcount-related costs that include payroll, employee benefits, bonuses, travel and entertainment and share-based compensation to our development staff, and overhead costs that are allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. We consider most of our software development costs to be variable and expect these costs to increase as our customized revenues grow. Of our total software development cost substantially all relate to the cost of developing and implementing our customized software solutions. We also expect to hire more software development engineers at potentially higher costs per person. As a result, we expect our gross margins to decline in the next few years. Our software delivery share-based compensation expenses were $7.8 million, $1.6 million and $2.5 million during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.  Other services costs. Costs associated with ATM maintenance include headcount-related costs for our maintenance staff and spare parts inventory costs. Costs related to ancillary services are primarily headcount-related expenses. We expect other services costs to increase proportionately with revenues from these services. Our other services share-based compensation expenses were $229,000, $252,000 and $428,000 during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Operating expenses. Operating expenses consist of research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill.  Research and development expenses. These include expenses related to our research and development center and supporting departments that are not otherwise attributed to software development. They are primarily headcount-related expenses that include payroll, employee benefits, bonuses, travel and entertainment and share-based compensation to our research and development staff, and overhead costs that are allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. We also incur expenses for training our research and development staff and for professional fees of consultants in connection with our research and development activities. We expense research and development costs when incurred. To enhance our standardized solution products, we plan to invest aggressively in research and development, which can be expected to result in research and development increasing from 2010 levels as a percentage of revenue. Our research and development share-based compensation expenses were $1.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. 48 Table of Contents  Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses include headcount-related expenses, allowance for doubtful accounts and, to a lesser extent, third party advertising and promotional expenses related to our sales and marketing functions. As we do not undertake significant advertising or promotion activities, these expenses are primarily headcount-related expenses that include payroll, employee benefits, commissions paid to our employees, travel and entertainment, share-based compensation to our sales and marketing staff and overhead costs that are allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. Our sales and marketing share-based compensation expenses were $4.7 million, $1.5 million and $2.4 million during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.  General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily include costs related to our finance, legal, human resources and executive office functions, gains or losses on fixed assets and provisions for other receivables less government subsidies related directly to our operating expenses. These departmental costs are primarily professional fees and expenses related to headcount. Headcount-related expenses include payroll, bonuses, employee benefits, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment and overhead costs that are allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. We expect our general and administrative expenses, excluding share- based compensation, to increase in absolute amounts and be steady as a percentage of our revenues due to expected increases in professional fees, board of directors compensation and costs related to investor relations and director and officer insurance. Our general and administrative share-based compensation expenses were $14.0 million, $1.9 million and $1.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The amount of our share-based compensation expense that was recorded as operation expense was $20.1 million, $3.7 million and $4.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Share-based Compensation Expenses We adopted our 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan in November 2005. We have reserved 8,550,000 ordinary shares as of the date of this annual report for issuance of our stock options and restricted share units under our 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan. For a description of our 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan, see Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan. Since the adoption of the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan, we have made various stock option grants to some of our directors, employees and consultants. From the inception of our 2005 Plan through March 31, 2010, 4,372,740 options to purchase ordinary shares had been granted, of which 1,179,900 stock options had been forfeited, and 1,780,650 restricted share units had been granted, of which 97,150 restricted share units had been forfeited. We recognize share-based compensation, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, and therefore only recognize compensation expenses for those shares expected to vest over the vesting period of the award, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on actual employee turnover. Our share-based compensation expenses for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were $28.2 million, $5.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2010, we had $24.5 million in total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of forecasted forfeitures, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3.2 years. 49 Table of Contents During the year ended March 31, 2008, we granted a total of 112,500 options and 636,650 restricted share units with vesting terms of four years and recorded share-based compensation expense of $28.2 million of which $3.4 million for share-based compensation from stock options and restricted share units issued directly by our company. An additional $24.8 million of the share-based compensation expense related the sale in 2006 by Well Active International Limited, or Well Active, of approximately 5 million of our ordinary shares to our officers and employees at a price of $4.83 per share, paid for with a promissory note. In October 2007, Well Active cancelled promissory notes and accrued interest for 4,790,550 shares, which resulted in share-based compensation expense of $24.8 million. No amounts under promissory notes were due by employees to Well Active as at March 31, 2008. During the year ended March 31, 2009, we did not grant any options, but we did grant 368,500 restricted share units primarily with vesting terms of four years, and we recorded share-based compensation expense of $5.6 million. During the year ended March 31, 2010, we did not grant any options, but we did grant 775,500 restricted share units primarily with vesting terms of four years, and we recorded share-based compensation expense of $7.7 million. Determination of Fair Value of Share-based Compensation We are responsible for estimating the fair value of the options we granted and other share-related transactions. The determination of fair value requires us to make complex and subjective judgments about our projected financial and operating results. It also requires making certain assumptions such as cost of capital, general market and macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, comparable companies, price volatility of our shares, expected lives of options and discount rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions could significantly affect the amount of employee share-based compensation expense we recognize in our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to becoming a public company on October 25, 2007, we determined the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying the restricted share units based on the closing ordinary share price on the date of grant. Subsequent to becoming a public company on October 25, 2007, we did not issue any stock options. Prior to becoming a public company on October 25, 2007, we determined the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying the options and transferred shares by employing two valuation methods: the discounted cash flow method under the income approach and the guideline companies method under the market approach. The discounted cash flow method is a method within the income approach whereby the present value of future expected net cash flows is calculated using a discount rate. The guideline companies method incorporates certain assumptions, including the market performance of comparable listed companies as well as our financial results and growth trends, to derive our total equity value. Other assumptions used in deriving the fair values include the following: (i) no material changes in the existing political, legal, fiscal and economic conditions in China; (ii) no material changes in tax law in China or the tax rates applicable to our subsidiaries; and (iii) no material deviation in market conditions from economic forecasts. In addition to the above, to reflect the fact that we were a private company at the time of each of our valuations performed prior to March 31, 2007, a 25% lack of marketability discount, or LOMD, was applied to the derived equity value. The LOMD was supported with reference to both qualitative studies and quantitative analysis. The qualitative studies examine prices paid in private transactions for shares of companies that subsequently became publicly-traded through an IPO. We also considered empirical studies based on prices paid for restricted stock. The restricted stock studies analyze transactions in restricted shares where marketability at the end of the required holding period was virtually assured, since the subject companies shares were already publicly traded. We also used two quantitative valuation methods, including the option pricing method (implied from a put option) and the Longstaff Regression Analysis, which resulted in a LOMD range of 19.4% to 26.8%. Given the transaction costs necessary to implement the put options, the restricted stock regression analysis and the qualitative factors, we determined that 25% was the proper LOMD. 50 Table of Contents We determined the fair value of the options on the date of grant by using the binomial option-pricing method after considering: average risk-free rate of return, which was between 3.36% and 4.80%, volatility which was between 54.33% and 57.20% and an assumption of no dividends. If different assumptions were used, our share-based compensation expenses, net income and income per share could have been significantly different. As of March 31, 2010 we have fully recognized all of the compensation expense from the grants made in 2006. As of March 31, 2010, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from the grants made during three months ended March 31, 2007 is expected to be recognized over the remaining one year of the vesting period for the options. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances We began our operations as a provider of general IT services to the financial services industry in 1996 and began focusing on software development for the financial services industry in 2001. The primary driver of our revenue growth since inception has been organic business development, supplemented to a lesser extent by strategic acquisitions. The following are some of our recent acquisitions and strategic alliances:  In February 2006, we entered into the outsourcing business by establishing Longtop International, with three other shareholders, and later acquired the interests from the other shareholders in January 2007. We subsequently disposed of our interest in LTI through a dividend in kind to our existing shareholders in July 2007;  In March 2006, we assumed certain aspects of the China business of S1 Corporation (S) Pte.

Ltd., or Huashang. Both companies provide domain name sales and online hosting services. Because regulations in China currently restrict or prevent foreign-invested entities from engaging in value-added telecommunication services, including online hosting services, we acquired and currently hold Hooyoo, and hold the assets acquired from Huashang, through a VIE arrangement, under which two of our employees hold all of the equity interests in Longtop Online (formerly, Xiamen Bizcn Network Co., Ltd.), which is the sole parent of Hooyoo and holds the assets acquired from Huashang. We control Longtop Online, however, through a series of contractual arrangements with the two employees.  In February 2009, we acquired Beijing Jactus Ruanbo Software and Technology Co., Ltd., or Jactus, a leading third-party testing company focused on Chinas financial industry. We acquired Jactus in order to increase our share in the market for such services.  In December 2008, we entered into an arrangement with S1, whereby we are assisting S1 in the implementation of S1s customer relationship management platform at one of Thailands largest banks. This is our first significant contract outside of China, as we are providing services in Thailand as well as from our China delivery centers.  In May 2009, we acquired Sysnet Data Co. Limited and its subsidiary Sysnet Info-tech Corporation, or Systnet, an IT service provider focused on Chinas insurance industry. The purchase price consisted of a fixed cash consideration of $20.5 million and contingent cash consideration of up to $7.9 million, which was payable upon Sysnet achieving certain financial and operational milestones during the 2009 and 2010 calendar years. Sysnet achieved the 2009 calendar year financial and operational milestones and we paid contingent consideration of $3.7 million prior to March 31, 2010. In January 2010, we agreed to waive the financial and operational milestones for the calendar year of 2010 and to pay the remaining $586,000 and $3.7 million of contingent consideration in April 2010 and 2011, respectively.

The purchase price consisted of a fixed cash consideration of $50.4 million and contingent earnout payments and other contingent consideration. Base earnout payments are payable if Giantstone meets certain post-tax net profit performance targets for the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2011. Additional earnout payments are payable to the extent the aforementioned base post-tax net profit performance targets are exceeded, with no limit on the additional earnout amount. Other contingent consideration up to $879,000 will be payable in 2015 if Giantstone achieves other operational milestones during the period from 2010 to 2014.

We currently plan to conduct further acquisitions and form additional strategic alliances to maintain or grow our revenues. 52 Table of Contents Taxation We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Under the current law of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income or capital gains tax. In addition, dividend payments are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. Longtop BVI, our subsidiary organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, is not subject to income or capital gains tax. In addition, dividend payments are not subject to withholding tax in the British Virgin Islands. Our subsidiary in Hong Kong is subject to a profit tax at the rate of 16.5% on assessable profit determined under relevant Hong Kong tax regulations. We conduct substantially all of our business and earn substantially all of our net income through our PRC operating subsidiaries which have applicable tax rates that range from 10% to 25%, dependent on tax holidays or preferred tax treatment, as discussed below. Prior to January 1, 2008, our subsidiaries in China were governed by the Income Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China concerning Foreign Investment Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises and local income tax laws (the PRC Income Tax Law). Pursuant to the previous PRC Income Tax Law, wholly-foreign-owned enterprises were subject to tax on PRC taxable income at a statutory rate of 33% (30% state income tax plus 3% local income tax), 15% where the subsidiary was located in a special economic zone or 15% for certain technology enterprises which were classified as high and new technology enterprises (HNTE) and established in the State High and New Technology Industrial Development Zones designated by the State Council or the New Technology Industrial Development Experimental Zone of Beijing. Furthermore, HNTE were exempted from Chinese state corporate income tax for two years (three years for those established in the New Technology Industrial Development Experimental Zone of Beijing), beginning with their first profitable year of operation after utilizing any tax losses carried forward from prior years, and were entitled to a 50% tax reduction, to a rate of 7.5%, for the subsequent three years and a reduction to a rate of 15% thereafter. During the nine months ended December 31, 2007, substantially all of our operations in the PRC were subject to tax at 15% as they were located in a special economic zone. In March 2007, the Chinese government enacted the Corporate Income Tax Law, and promulgated related regulations, which were effective January 1, 2008. The Corporate Income Tax Law, among other things, imposes a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. HNTE will still enjoy a favorable tax rate of 15% provided they can meet the qualifying criteria. The previous income tax laws and rules, which stipulated income tax rates for domestic and foreign invested enterprises at different rates, expired upon the effectiveness of the Corporate Income Tax Law. The Corporate Income Tax Law provides a five-year transitional period for those entities established before March 16, 2007, which enjoyed a favorable income tax rate of less than 25% under the previous income tax laws and rules, to gradually change their rates to 25%. On December 26, 2007, the State Council issued the Notice of the State Council Concerning Implementation of Transitional Rules for Enterprise Income Tax Incentives (Circular 39). Based on Circular 39, certain specifically listed categories of enterprises which enjoyed a preferential tax rate of 15% are eligible for a graduated rate increase to 25% over the 5-year period beginning from January 1, 2008. Specifically, the applicable rates under such an arrangement for such enterprises would be 18%, 20%, 22%, 24% and 25% for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and thereafter, respectively. As most of our income is earned in the Xiamen special economic zone, during the three months ended March 31, 2008, we applied an effective tax rate of 18% for income subject to taxation in China. Longtop System, which accounts for the majority of Longtops taxable income, FEnet, Sysnet and Giantstone have been designated as a HNTE effective from 2008 and will be subject to an income tax rate of 15% as long as it qualifies as a HNTE. During 2010, other than subsidiaries qualified as HNTE, the Companys subsidiaries in the PRC were subject to tax at rates ranging from 20% to 25% depending on their location within China. 53 Table of Contents In December 2009, we received a notification from the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Commerce, and State Administration of Taxation that its subsidiary, Longtop System, qualified as a Key Software Enterprise for the calendar year ended December 31, 2009, providing a 10% tax rate for income earned during the calender year ended December 31, 2009. Longtop System received a similar preferential tax rate for the 2008 and 2007 calender years. However, due to the significant uncertainty of obtaining similar preferential tax rates for future years, we did not assume Longtop System would continue to enjoy the 10% tax rate after January 1, 2010. Instead, we have used the 15% preferential tax rate in calculation of deferred taxes of Longtop Systems. The Corporate Income Tax Law also imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to a non-resident enterprise outside of China, which arise from profits earned after January 1, 2008. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if there is a favorable tax treaty between mainland China and the jurisdiction or region of the non-resident enterprise. For example, holding companies in Hong Kong that are also tax residents in Hong Kong are eligible for a 5% withholding tax (for the Hong Kong holding company which directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the foreign invested enterprise) on dividends under the Tax Memorandum between China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Since we intend to reinvest our earnings to further expand our businesses in mainland China, our foreign invested enterprises do not intend to declare dividends to their immediate foreign holding companies in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2010, we have not recorded any withholding tax on $125 million in retained earnings of our foreign invested enterprises in China. Uncertainties exist with respect to how Chinas current income tax law applies to our overall operations, and more specifically, with regard to tax residency status. The Corporate Income Tax Law includes a provision specifying that legal entities organized outside of China will be considered residents for Chinese income tax purposes if their place of effective management or control is within China. The Implementation Rules to the Corporate Income Tax Law provide that non-resident legal entities will be considered China residents if substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. occurs within China. Additional guidance is expected to be released by the Chinese government in the near future that may clarify how to apply the rules to taxpayers. Despite the present uncertainties resulting from the limited PRC tax guidance on the issue, the Company does not believe that its legal entities organized outside of China are residents for Corporate Income Tax Law purposes. If one or more of our legal entities organized outside of China were characterized as China tax residents for the year ended March 31, 2010, the impact would adversely affect our results of operation. Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Value-Added Tax and its implementing rules, all entities and individuals that are engaged in the businesses of sales of goods, provision of repair and placement services and importation of goods into China are generally subject to a value-added tax, or VAT, at a rate of 17% (with the exception of certain goods which are subject to a rate of 13%) of the gross sales proceeds received, less any VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayer on the goods or services purchased by it and utilized in the production of goods or provisions of services that have generated the gross sales proceeds. However, pursuant to Certain Policies for Encouraging Software Industry and Integrated Circuits Industry issued in 2000, an enterprise classified as a software enterprise will be entitled to a rebate of its net VAT liability to the extent that it exceeds 3% of the actual VAT burden relating to self-made software product sales (excluding export sales).Such refund will not be treated as taxable income and must be used for funding its software research and development and the expansion of its production capacity. According to the Notice on Certain Policies Related to Value Added Tax, issued in November 2005, an entity that develops software products on commission may be entitled to an exemption of VAT if, according to the contractual arrangement, the copyright of the products developed by it shall be owned by the commissioning party or jointly owned by the developer and commissioning party. Companies in China are generally subject to business tax and related surcharges by various local tax authorities on revenue generated from providing services and revenue generated from the transfer of intangibles such as copyrights. The applicable business tax rate varies from 3% to 5%. However, qualified technology companies may apply for an exemption from business tax for revenues generated from technology development, transfer or related consulting services, according to a notice issued by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation in November 1999. 54 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made, and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could material impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates. The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is derived from two primary sources: (i) software development revenues represent revenues from the development, customization, testing, implementation and licensing of software, consulting and post-contract customer support (PCS), and (ii) other services represent revenue from the maintenance of ATMs, the provision of system integration services which include assisting customers with the procurement and installation of hardware and software and other IT and technology related services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured or, in the case of software arrangements, when collectibility is probable. 1) Software development services Where the software development contracts include multiple elements, we allocate revenues to the various elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. Our VSOE of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately, or for elements not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority which, once established, will not change before being sold separately. We defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements and recognize revenue for the remainder of the contractual arrangement fee attributable to the delivered elements when the basic criteria of software revenue recognition guidance have been met. We recognize revenue on delivered elements only if: (a) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products or services, (b) we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event it does not deliver the undelivered products or services, (c) there is evidence of the fair value for each undelivered product or service, and (d) the revenue recognition criteria otherwise have been met for the delivered elements. Otherwise, revenue on delivered elements is recognized when the undelivered elements are delivered. If the only undelivered element is PCS for which we have established VSOE, we recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for PCS as revenue upon delivery (the residual method). Where PCS revenue is deferred, the PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the PCS term. We periodically negotiate the sale of upgrades and enhancements with our customers. Such arrangements are accounted for separately from the initial sale given that (i) they are not negotiated within a short time frame of each other, (ii) the products from the initial sale are not dependent on delivery of the upgrades or enhancements, (iii) neither the fees for the initial or subsequent sale are subject to refund if one or the other contracts is not fulfilled nor are payment terms for either sale tied to the performance of the other and (iv) the arrangements are not considered a single project. Standardized SolutionsFor software development contracts that do not involve significant modification (standardized solutions), we recognize the entire arrangement fee after the software is implemented and customer acceptance is received, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We accrue the estimated cost of providing PCS at the time the revenue is recorded, as the cost of providing PCS on the standardized solution arrangements is insignificant. 55 Table of Contents Customized SolutionsFor software development contracts that require significant modification or customization of the core software (customized solutions), revenues from the software license and development services are recognized over the customization and implementation period using the percentage of completion method. We measure progress toward completion by comparing direct labor costs incurred to total estimated direct labor costs for the project. Where revisions in estimated contract profits are necessary, they are made in the period in which the circumstances requiring the revision become known. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract estimates. We defer the fair value of PCS as indicated by VSOE and recognizes the revenue ratably over the PCS period. Revenue from PCS renewal, software testing and software consulting arrangements that are not combined with other elements is recognized ratably over the service period, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 2) Other services Revenue from ATM maintenance and ancillary services is recognized as such services are performed or ratably over the contractual period. Costs associated with these contracts are expensed as incurred. Contract periods are generally less than one year. Revenue from system integration services, a component of ancillary services, is recognized as services are performed and is recorded net of amounts paid to suppliers. We obtain manufacturers warranties and support for the third party hardware and software it sells. No warranty costs have been accrued at March 31, 2009 or March 31, 2010. Our management must determine whether to record our system integration revenues using the gross or net method of reporting. With our system integration services we assist clients with the procurement and installation of hardware and software that best meet their system requirements. Determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors, principally whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction. The determination of whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and based on an evaluation of the terms of an arrangement. Based on our assessment, our system integration revenues are recorded on a net basis because we do not take general inventory risk, we do not make changes to third-party products, we have limited involvement in the determination of product or services or supplier selection and in substance the original equipment manufacturers are the primary obligors as the product quality and warranty is provided by the original equipment manufacturer. Our subsidiaries are subject to business tax on the revenues earned for services provided in the PRC. The applicable business tax rate varies from 3% to 5%. Effective April 1, 2008, software development and other services revenues are presented net of business taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to April 1, 2008, the Company deducted business taxes from total gross revenue to arrive at net revenue. This change has been applied retrospectively. Business taxes included in revenue during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $774,000, $1.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. As part of the PRC governments policy of encouraging software development in the PRC, Longtop System is entitled to a refund of value-added tax paid at a rate of 14% of the sales value of certain standardized software products. The amount of the value-added tax refund included in software development revenue was $2.7 million, $3.6 million and $5.5 million for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Revenue in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled receivables, which is included in accounts receivable and amounted to $10.9 million and $25.4 million as of March 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, net of allowances. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. Billings are rendered based on agreed milestones included in the contracts with customers. 56 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivables Our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivables, historical bad debts, customer credit- worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our accounts receivable balances on March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010 were $29.9 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.0 million, and $65.6 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.6 million, respectively. If the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, an additional allowance might be required. Acquisitions We account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Our management makes judgments in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as in estimating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired. We use the income approach in valuing the intangible assets. We measure the fair value of the covenants not to compete based on incremental discounted cash flows computed with and without assumed competition. Key assumptions include discounted cash flow with and without assumed competition and probability of competition. Trade names are valued using the relief from royalty method, which is the discounted cash flow savings accruing to the owner by virtue of the fact that the owner does not have to pay the royalty. Key assumptions include attrituable revenue expected from the trade name, royalty rate and assumed asset life. Customer relationships are valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the existing intangible asset after reduction by an estimated fair rate of return on contributory assets necessary to realize the projected earnings attributable to the intangible asset. Key assumptions used include discounted cash flow, estimated life cycle and customer attrition rates. Backlog is valued using the multi-period excess earnings method based on the discounted cash flow to be generated from acquired customer contracts. Developed technology is valued using the multi-period excess earnings method based on the discounted cash flow and technology attrituion rate. The discounted cash flow includes significant estimates and assumptions, including projected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates calculated based on long-term government bond yields adjusted for various risks, including the size of the acquiree, industry risk and other risk. We determine the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets based on an analysis of all pertinent factors, including our expected use of the asset, any contractual provisions that may limit the life of the asset, the effects of competition, the trends of technological advances, and our historical experience in renewing similar arrangements for renewable intangibles. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the Companys business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment) on an annual basis as of October 1. We perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. Longtop Online and its subsidiaries, engaged in internet services, were acquired by the Company in July 2008 and included in the other services segment. During the year ended March 31, 2010, we determined that an indication of potential goodwill and long-lived asset impairment existed due to continued operating and cash flow losses, despite the our initiatives to improve performance. Longtop Online and its subsidiaries are considered a reporting unit and their associated intangible assets represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. As the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying value, we recognized a full impairment loss of $2.5 million, as the estimated fair value of the intangibles was negligible. We then tested goodwill for impairment and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit, based on a discounted cash flow analysis, and recorded a goodwill impairment of $2.0 million as the implied fair value of goodwill was nil. In computing the discounted cash flow, we used significant unobservable inputs, including projected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates calculated based on long-term government bond yields adjusted for various risk related to the industry, business size and other factors. The remaining report units that were subject to the annual goodwill impairment test had fair values which exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant margin as of the most recent test date. 57 Table of Contents Share-Based Compensation We recognize our share-based compensation to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, restricted share units and other equity-based awards, based on their grant date fair values. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost related to employee options and similar equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which is usually the vesting period. We determine fair value using the Black-Scholes model. Under this model, certain assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the options, the estimated fair value of our ordinary shares and the expected volatility, are required to determine the fair value of the options. In addition, forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. If different assumptions had been used, the fair value of the options, net of estimated forfeitures, would have been different from the amount we computed and recorded. We are responsible for estimating the fair value of the options granted by us and other share-related transactions. The determination of fair value requires us to make complex and subjective judgments about the projected financial and operating results. It also requires making certain assumptions such as cost of capital, general market and macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, comparable companies and our share price volatility, expected lives of options and discount rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions could significantly affect the amount of employee share-based compensation expense it recognizes in its consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to becoming a public company, we determined the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying the restricted shares units based on the closing ordinary share price on the date of grant. Subsequent to becoming a public company, we did not issue any stock options. Prior to becoming a public company, we determined the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying the options and transferred shares by considering a number of factors to determine our aggregate equity value. This analysis included the discounted cash flow method, a method within the income approach whereby the present value of future expected net cash flows is calculated using a discount rate, and the guideline companies approach, which incorporates certain assumptions including the market performance of comparable listed companies as well as our financial results and growth trends, to derive our total equity value. Other assumptions used in deriving the fair values include: no material changes in the existing political, legal, fiscal and economic conditions in China; no material changes in tax law in China or the tax rates applicable to our subsidiaries and; and no material deviation in market conditions from economic forecasts. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. Determination of the fair value of share-based compensation is further discussed in Factors Affecting Our Results of OperationsShare Based Compensation ExpensesDetermination of Fair Value of Share-based Compensation. 58 Table of Contents Income Taxes We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider positive and negative evidence to determine whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a more-likely-than-not threshold. Our ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law. Longtop System, FEnet, Sysnet and Gianstone have been designated as a HNTE, effective January 1, 2008, and will be subject to an income tax rate of 15% for three years as long as they qualify as a HNTE. At the conclusion of the three year period, the qualifying enterprise has the option to renew its HNTE status for an additional three years through a simplified application process if such enterprises business operations continue to qualify for HNTE status. After the first six years, the enterprise would have to go through a new application process in order to renew its HNTE status. We have applied a 15% tax rate in the calculation of deferred taxes as we expect to retain the HNTE status for the foreseeable future. If one or more of HNTE will not renew its HNTE in foreseeable future, the impact would adversely affect our results of operation. The Corporate Income Tax Law also imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to a non-resident enterprise outside of China, which arise from profits earned after January 1, 2008. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if there is a favorable tax treaty between mainland China and the jurisdiction or region of the non-resident enterprise. For example, holding companies in Hong Kong that are also tax residents in Hong Kong are eligible for a 5% withholding tax (for the Hong Kong holding company which directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the foreign invested enterprise) on dividends under the Tax Memorandum between China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Since we intend to reinvest our earnings to further expand our businesses in mainland China, our foreign invested enterprises do not intend to declare dividends to their immediate foreign holding companies in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2010, we have not recorded any withholding tax on $125 million in retained earnings of our foreign invested enterprises in China. 59 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated.

Revenues from the software development and other services segments accounted for 83.7% and 16.3%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2008, 84.3%, and 15.7%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2009, and 85.9% and 14.1%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010. The software development segment consists of the development, customization, testing, implementation, licensing, consulting and maintenance of software in accordance with clients specifications. The ATM maintenance services segment consists of the maintenance of ATMs. The ancillary services segment consists of the procurement of software and hardware on behalf of clients and providing IT management, consulting and supplementary technology related services. We allocate a portion of shared facilities costs to the segments cost of revenues based on headcount and review the performance of segments based on segment gross profit. We do not allocate operating expenses to the segments. Year Ended March 31, 2008 2009 2010 Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Revenues gross profit Revenues gross profit Revenues gross profit ($ in thousands) Reportable segments: Software development 55,147 34,009 89,559 63,265 145,200 99,320 ATM maintenance services 4,275 2,285 7,655 2,978 8,727 1,948 Ancillary services 6,494 3,967 9,082 3,636 15,130 4,444 Total 65,916 40,261 106,296 69,879 169,057 105,712 Year Ended March 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2009 Total Revenues. Total revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, or fiscal 2010, were $169.1 million, an increase of 59.0% from $106.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2009, or fiscal 2009. Other than revenue from Sysnet, total revenues for fiscal 2010 increased by 46.9%.  Software development services segment. Revenues from our software development services increased by 62.1% from $89.6 million in fiscal 2009 to $145.2 million in fiscal 2010. Sysnet, acquired by Longtop in the first fiscal quarter of 2010, contributed 8.4% of this growth with the remaining 53.7% attributable to organic growth.  From a client-type perspective, increased sales to Other Banks and Insurance clients. Software development revenue from the Big Four Banks in fiscal 2010 was $63.1 million, an increase of 50.2% from fiscal 2009, which is consistent with the growth of our software development revenue, other than revenue from Sysnet, of 53.7%. Big Four Banks accounted for 43.5% of software development revenues in fiscal 2010, as compared to 46.9% in fiscal 2009. Our Big Four Banks clients in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 included three of the Big Four Banks and each of the Big Four Banks percentage contribution to our revenue was relatively similar in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, with growth in all of our three Big Four Bank clients. Two of our Big Four Bank clients contributed more than 10% of our software development revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to three of the Big Four Bank clients contributing more than 10% in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 our largest Big Four Bank client accounted for 22% and 22% of our software development revenue, respectively. Software development revenue from Other Banks in fiscal 2010 was $54.2 million, an increase of 56.7% from fiscal 2009. Other Banks excludes the Big Four Banks and includes national commercial banks, policy banks, city banks, rural credit unions and China Post Bank. Other Banks accounted for 37.3% of software development revenues for fiscal 2010, as compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2009. Since 2006, we have strategically focused on diversifying our customer base to reduce reliance on Big Four Banks by developing solutions to meet Other Bank requirements, including through strategic acquisitions, and aligning our sales people to also focus on the Other Bank segment. The growth in software development revenue from Other Banks was attributable to higher revenue per existing customer as opposed to revenue from new customers as we had additional solutions to meet their requirements and improved our cross selling. Other Banks also increased their IT spending to improve their customer service, products and management, and we benefitted from this increased investment. Software development revenue from insurance clients in fiscal 2010 was $21.8 million, an increase of 121.5% from fiscal 2009. We first began targeting the Insurance sector in the later part of 2006. During fiscal 2010, insurance clients accounted for 15.0% of software development revenues, as compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009. Sysnet, which we acquired in June 2009, contributed $6.1 million of Insurance software development revenue in fiscal 2010. Other than Sysnet, revenue from insurance clients for fiscal 2010 increased 59.9% which was attributable to higher revenue per existing customer as opposed to revenue from new customers as we had additional solutions to meet their requirements and improved our cross selling. 61 Table of Contents Software development revenue from Enterprises in fiscal 2010 was $6.1 million, an increase of 94.6% from fiscal 2009. The growth rate for Enterprises was higher than our overall growth rate as we have recently launched new treasury management solutions with our largest customer being the a state owned tobacco group.  Growth in demand for our business intelligence and management-related solutions from a solutions perspective. As our clients sought to improve their internal systems such as office automation, risk management, human resource management, and content management, together with the acquisition of Sysnet which contributed $3.5 million in revenue, our management solutions revenues grew 54.1% to $55.8 million in fiscal 2010 from $36.2 million in fiscal 2009. Business intelligence solutions revenues were $53.1 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of 92.5% from $27.6 million in fiscal 2009. Demand for business intelligence solutions was driven by our customers building out data warehouses and business intelligence applications to conduct business and decision-making analysis in order to better understand their customers behavior and the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns, and to obtain more accurate and timely information to manage their business. There was strong demand primarily from Big Four Banks and Other Banks for our business Intelligence solutions, where we are one of the strongest service providers in China for these solutions.  From a development methodology perspective Our revenue growth during fiscal 2010 was driven by both customized and standardized revenue growth. Our revenue from customized software solutions increased 60.0% from $58.3 million in fiscal 2009 to $93.3 million in fiscal 2010. Sysnet contributed $5.2 million to our customized software revenue in fiscal 2010. Other than Sysnet, customized revenue increased 51.1%. Our revenue from standardized software solutions increased 58.5% from $28.2 million in fiscal 2009 to $44.7 million in fiscal 2010. Our maintenance revenue increased 136.1% from $3.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $7.2 million in fiscal 2010 due to a larger installed product base as well as the acquisition of Sysnet, which contributed $1.5 million in maintenance revenue or 48.4% of the total year on year growth of 136.1%. Standardized software solutions as a percentage of software development revenues were 32.7%, 31.5% and 30.8% for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively and most of the growth has been organic.  Other Services Revenues: Revenues from Other Services increased by 42.5% from $16.7 million in fiscal 2009 to $23.9 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in our Other Services revenues was primarily due to growth in our ATM maintenance and ancillary services segments.  ATM maintenance services segment. Revenues from our ATM maintenance services segment increased by 14.0%, growing from $7.7 million in fiscal 2009 to $8.7 million in fiscal 2010. This growth was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Huayuchang Tongchuang, a provider of ATM maintenance services, which we acquired in fiscal 2009 as well as organic growth in the number of ATMs we were maintaining. At March 31, 2010, we had approximately 13,300 ATM machines under contract for maintenance as compared to approximately 11,000 ATM machines at March 31, 2009. 62 Table of Contents  Ancillary services segment. Revenues from our ancillary services segment increased by 66.6%, from $9.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $15.1 million in fiscal 2010 which was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sysnet, which contributed $5.3 million in ancillary services revenue. Other than Sysnet, ancillary services revenue increased 7.9%. Ancillary services revenue includes revenue from Longtop International Holdings Limited, or LTI, a related party, of $3.2 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $0.9 million in fiscal 2009. Gross Margin; Cost of Revenues. Our gross margins decreased by 320 basis points to 62.5% in fiscal 2010 from 65.7% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the factors explained below.  Software development services costs and gross margin  Software development costs. These consist of design, implementation, delivery and maintenance costs of our software solutions and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Software development costs are primarily headcount-related costs, including payroll, employee benefits, bonuses, travel and entertainment and share-based compensation to our development staff, and overhead costs allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. We consider most of our software development costs to be variable and will increase as our sales grow. Of our total software development costs, substantially all relates to the cost of developing and implementing our customized software solutions.  Software development gross margin. Our software development services gross margin decreased by 220 basis points to 68.4% in fiscal 2010 compared to 70.6% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to (i) our acquisition of Sysnet, which has lower gross margins than we do, (ii) our investment into our software development consulting and professional services business, which has lower incremental gross margins than our software development business, (iii) the location of an increased percentage of our work force in higher cost cities such as Beijing, in order to satisfy customer requirements, and (iv) our acquisition in January 2010 of Giantstone, which incurred expenses but did not contribute revenue in fiscal 2010. As of March 31, 2010, we had 2,492 software development engineers, compared to 1,310 as of March 31, 2009.  Other Services costs and gross margin.  Other Services costs. Costs associated with ATM maintenance include headcount-related costs for our maintenance staff and spare parts inventory costs. Costs related to ancillary services include headcount-related expenses and amortization of backlog arising from acquisitions and an impairment charge of intangible assets.  Other Services gross margin. Gross margins from our Other Services revenue declined by 1270 basis points to 26.8% in fiscal 2010 compared to 39.5% in fiscal 2009, primarily due to a decline in the gross margin of the ATM maintenance and ancillary services segments.  ATM maintenance services segment. Gross margins from our ATM maintenance services segment declined by 1,660 basis points to 22.3% in fiscal 2010 from 38.9% in 2009 due to lower gross margins on Huayuchang Tongchuang, which we acquired during fiscal 2009, lower revenue per ATM due to competition in the market and additional spare parts purchases associated with maintaining additional ATM brands.  Ancillary services segment. Gross margins from our ancillary services segment declined by 1,060 basis points to 29.4% in fiscal 2010 from 40.0% in 2009 due primarily to a $1.6 million impairment of intangible assets recorded in cost of revenues for fiscal 2010 and, to a lesser extent, higher wage costs without corresponding increases in the ancillary services revenue. 63 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses. These include expenses related to our research and development center and supporting departments that are not otherwise attributed to software development. They are primarily headcount-related expenses, including payroll, employee benefits, bonuses, travel and entertainment and share-based compensation to our research and development staff, and overhead costs allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. We also incur expenses for training our research and development staff and for professional fees of consultants in connection with our research and development activities. We expense research and development costs when incurred. Our research and development expenses increased by 58.9%, from $5.2 million in fiscal 2009 to $8.2 million in fiscal 2010, representing 4.9% and 4.9% of total revenues, respectively. This increase was primarily due to additional headcount-related costs as we expanded our investment in research and development through our acquisition of Sysnet and to a lesser extent organically. At March 31, 2010, we had 279 research and development staff as compared to 208 at March 31, 2009 (of which 185 were dedicated to software development research). Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses include headcount-related expenses, allowance for doubtful accounts and, to a lesser extent, third-party advertising and promotional expenses related to our sales and marketing functions. As we do not undertake significant advertising or promotion activities, these expenses are primarily headcount-related expenses that include payroll, employee benefits, commissions paid to our employees, travel and entertainment, share-based compensation to our sales and marketing staff and overhead costs that are allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 91.3% from $11.0 million in fiscal 2009 to $21.0 million in fiscal 2010, representing 10.3% and 12.4% of total revenues, respectively. Our sales and marketing expenses year on year increase of 91.3% was higher than revenue growth of 59.0% primarily due to increasing headcount from 287 at March 31, 2009 to 437 at March 31, 2010, as we added presales, solution center, product sales and online business headcount; and $2.0 million in amortization of acquired intangibles in fiscal 2010 as compared to $545,000 in fiscal 2009 which contributed 13.3 percent to the 91.3% increase. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily include costs related to our finance, legal, human resources and executive office functions, gains or losses on the sale or disposal of fixed assets and provisions for other receivables, less government subsidies directly related to our operating expenses. These departmental costs are primarily professional fees and expenses related to headcount. Headcount-related expenses include payroll, bonuses, employee benefits, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment and overhead costs that are allocated based on headcount. Allocated overhead primarily includes office rental, communication costs and depreciation. Our general and administrative expenses increased by 49.4% from $9.4 million in fiscal 2009 to $14.0 million in fiscal 2010, representing 8.8% and 8.3% of total revenues, respectively. This increase was primarily due to additional headcount, which increased from 238 at March 31, 2009 to 303 at March 31. 2010, approximately $1.1 million in acquisition related professional fees which effective April 1, 2009 cannot be included as the cost of an acquisition, and additional professional fees and public company expenses. Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2010, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $2.0 million in our Other Services segment associated with our online business. Other Income (Expenses). Our other income (expenses) decreased from $5.2 million in fiscal 2009 to $4.2 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest income which was $5.6 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to $4.3 million in fiscal 2010 caused by the decline in interest rates. Income Tax Expenses. Our income tax expenses in fiscal 2010 were $5.7 million, an effective tax rate of 8.8%, compared to $6.1 million in fiscal 2009, or an effective tax rate of 12.3%. This difference in effective tax rate was primarily due to the inclusion of a $3.8 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2010 associated with our qualification as a Key Software Company for the 2009 calendar year. This tax benefit reduced our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate by 5.9%. Net Income. As a result of the foregoing, we had net income of $59.1 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to a net income of $43.5 million in fiscal 2009. 64 Table of Contents Year Ended March 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2008 Total Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2009 were $106.3 million, an increase of 61.3% from $65.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2008, or fiscal 2008, primarily due to the reasons below.  Software development services segment. Revenues from our software development services increased by 62.4% from $55.1 million in 2008 to $89.6 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in our software development revenues reflects:  Exchange rate movements. The 62.4% growth in software development revenues reflects an appreciation in the Renminbi to U.S. dollar exchange rate from an average of 7.46 in fiscal 2008 to an average of 6.87 in fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of this appreciation, our total software development revenues increased by 49.6%.  From a client-type perspective, increased sales to Other Banks and Insurance clients. Software development revenue from the Big Four Banks in fiscal 2009 was $42.0 million, an increase of 52.8% from fiscal 2008. Big Four Banks accounted for 46.9% of software development revenues in fiscal 2009, as compared to 49.7% in fiscal 2008, indicating a growth rate approximately in line with our overall software development revenue growth rate. Our Big Four Banks clients in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 included three of the Big Four Banks and each of the Big Four Banks percentage contribution to our revenue was relatively similar in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, with growth in all of our three Big Four Bank clients. Each of the three of our Big Four Bank clients contributed more than 10% of our software development revenue in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 with our largest Big Four Bank client accounting for 24% and 22% in the respective years. The software development revenue from Other Banks in fiscal 2009 was $34.6 million, an increase of 95.8% from fiscal 2008, which was the highest of our four types of clients. Other Banks excludes the Big Four Banks and includes national commercial banks, policy banks, city banks, rural credit unions and China Post Bank. Other Banks accounted for 38.6% of software development revenues for fiscal 2009, as compared to 32.1% in fiscal 2008. Since 2006, we have strategically focused on diversifying our customer base to reduce reliance on Big Four Banks by developing solutions to meet Other Bank requirements, including through strategic acquisitions, and aligning our sales people to also focus on the Other Bank segment. The 95.8% growth was attributable to higher revenue per customer mainly from national commercial banks in fiscal 2009, as we had additional solutions to meet their requirements. National commercial banks also increased their IT spending to improve their customer service, products and management, and we benefitted from this increased investment. Revenue from Insurance clients in fiscal 2009 was $9.9 million and grew 82.4% from fiscal 2008. We first began targeting the Insurance sector in the later part of 2006. During fiscal 2009, Insurance clients accounted for 11.0% of software development revenues, as compared to 9.8% in fiscal 2008. The growth in Insurance in fiscal 2009 was mainly due to sales made to a new customer, a leading insurance agent in China as well as a number of other new insurance clients.  Growth in demand for our business intelligence and management-related solutions from a solutions perspective. Increases related primarily to growth in both management solutions and business intelligence revenues. As our clients sought to improve their internal systems such as office automation, risk management, human resource management, and content management, our management solutions revenues grew 93.2% to $36.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $18.7 million in fiscal 2008. 65 Table of Contents Business intelligence solutions revenues were $27.6 million in fiscal 2009, an increase of 80.1% from $15.3 million in fiscal 2008. Demand for business intelligence solutions was driven by our customers building out data warehouses and business intelligence applications to conduct business and decision-making analysis in order to better understand their customers behavior and the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns, and to obtain more accurate and timely information to manage their business. There was strong demand from both Big Four Banks and Other Banks for our business Intelligence solutions, where we are one of the strongest service providers in China for these solutions.  From a development methodology perspective Compared to fiscal 2008, our customized software solution revenues for fiscal 2009 grew 81.1% to $58.3 million from $32.2 million for fiscal 2008. In contrast, our standardized and maintenance software solution revenues grew at a slower rate as compared to customized solutions, with growth of 36.1%, from $23.0 million in fiscal 2008 to $31.3 million in fiscal 2009. Customized software solutions revenues represented 65.1% of software development revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to 58.3% in fiscal 2008. The increase in the customized revenue mix was due to numerous factors, including our business intelligence solutions growth, the fastest growing area for us in fiscal 2009 and solutions for the Insurance sector. Pricing for our customized and standardized products was relatively stable and was not a factor in changes in our revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009.  Other Services Revenues: Revenues from Other Services increased by 55.4% from $10.8 million in fiscal 2008 to $16.7 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in our Other Services revenues was primarily due to exchange rate movements and growth in our ATM maintenance and ancillary services segments.  Exchange rate movements. The 55.4% growth in Other Services revenues from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 reflects an appreciation in the Renminbi to U.S. dollar exchange rate from an average of 7.46 in fiscal 2008 to an average of 6.87 in fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of this appreciation, our Other Services revenue increased by 43.1 %.  ATM maintenance services segment. Revenues from our ATM maintenance services segment increased by 79.1%, growing from $4.3 million in fiscal 2008 to $7.7 million in fiscal 2009. This growth was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Beijing Huayuchang Co-Founder Technology Development Co., Limited, or Huayuchang Tongchuang, a provider of ATM maintenance services, which we acquired in fiscal 2009. At March 31, 2009, we had approximately 11,000 ATM machines under contract for maintenance as compared to approximately 6,400 ATM machines at March 31, 2008.  Ancillary services segment. Revenues from our ancillary services segment increased by 39.9%, from $6.5 million in fiscal 2008 to $9.1 million in fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue from LTI, a related party, of $1.9 million in 2009 as compared to $125,000 in 2008, revenue from Longtop Online, its wholly-owned subsidiary Hooyoo and the assets of Huashang, which were acquired in 2009, and, to a lesser extent, growth in our professional services and systems integration business. 66 Table of Contents Gross Margin; Cost of Revenues. Our gross margins increased by 4.8% to 65.8% in fiscal 2009 from 61.0% in fiscal 2008. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the factors explained below.  Software development gross margin. Our software development services gross margin increased by 8.9% to 70.6% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in gross margin was due to higher share-based compensation expenses in fiscal 2008, which were $7.8 million as compared to $1.6 million in fiscal 2009. The higher share-based compensation in fiscal 2008 was due to the cancellation by Well Active of principal and interest under promissory notes issued to it in 2006 in payment for ordinary shares Well Active had transferred to our officers and employees, as described above under Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Excluding the impact of the share-based compensation expenses, fiscal 2009 gross margin would have been approximately 3.4% lower than fiscal 2008. This 3.4% decline was due primarily to a higher mix of our software revenue coming from customized solutions, with 65.1% of software development revenue from customized solutions in fiscal 2009 as compared to 58.3% in fiscal 2008, as well as inflation-driven increases in salaries without corresponding increases in pricing. Customized solutions, which typically involve more manpower in development and implementation, have substantially lower gross margins than standardized solutions. Our acquisition of FEnet in October 2007, which primarily delivers customized solutions, also negatively impacted our gross margins in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we hired a significant number of new personnel to meet customized solutions demand. As of March 31, 2009, we had 1,310 software development engineers, compared to 913 as of March 31, 2008.  Other Services gross margin. Gross margins from our Other Services revenue declined by 18.6% during fiscal 2009 to 39.5% due to ATM maintenance and ancillary services segment gross margins decline.  ATM maintenance services segment. Gross margins from our ATM maintenance services segment declined by 14.6% to 38.9% in fiscal 2009 from 53.5% in 2008 due to lower gross margins on Huayuchang Tongchuang, which we acquired during fiscal 2009.  Ancillary services segment. Gross margins from our ancillary services segment declined by 21.1% to 40.0% in fiscal 2009 from 61.1% in 2008 due to an approximately 20.0% gross margin on LTI revenues and higher wage costs without corresponding increases in the ancillary services revenue. Research and Development Expenses. Our research and development expenses increased by 34.8% from $3.8 million in fiscal 2008 to $5.2 million in fiscal 2009, as a result of additional headcount-related costs as we expanded our investment in research and development organically and through our acquisition of FEnet in October 2007. At March 31, 2009, we had 208 research and development staff (of which 185 are dedicated to software development research) as compared to 164 at March 31, 2008. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 5.5% from $10.4 million in fiscal 2008 to $11.0 million in fiscal 2009, representing 15.8% and 10.3% of total revenues, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2008 included $4.7 million of share-based compensation expenses, primarily associated with the cancellation by Well Active during fiscal 2008 of principal and interest under promissory notes issued to it in 2006 in payment for ordinary shares Well Active had transferred to our officers and employees, as described above under Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Excluding the impact of the share-based compensation expenses of $4.7 million and $1.5 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, respectively, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have been relatively unchanged at 8.6% of revenues in fiscal 2008 and 8.9% of revenue in fiscal 2009 indicating sales and marketing grew in line with revenue. At March 31, 2009, we had 287 sales and marketing staff as compared to 129 at March 31, 2008. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 52.3% from $19.6 million in fiscal 2008 to $9.4 million in fiscal 2009, representing 29.8% and 8.8% of total revenues, respectively. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 included $14.0 million of share-based compensation expenses, primarily associated with the cancellation by Well Active during fiscal 2008 of principal and interest under promissory notes issued to it in 2006 in payment for ordinary shares Well Active had transferred to our officers and employees, as described above under Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses of $14.0 million and $1.9 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, respectively, our general and administrative expenses would have increased by approximately 32.1% primarily due to additional headcount, which increased from 200 at March 31, 2008 to 238 at March 31. 2009, and additional professional fees and public company expenses. 67 Table of Contents Other Income (Expenses). Our other income (expenses) increased from $1.4 million in fiscal 2008 to $5.2 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to additional interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering. Income Tax Expenses. Our income tax expenses in fiscal 2009 were $6.1 million, an effective tax rate of 12.3%, compared to $3.5 million in fiscal 2008, or an effective tax rate of 45.6%. The difference between the effective rate of 12.3% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 45.6% for fiscal 2008 was due primarily to higher share-based compensation expenses of $28.2 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to $5.6 million in 2009, which are not tax deductible. Excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are not deductible in China for income tax purposes, the effective tax rate would have been largely unchanged at 9.8% in fiscal 2008 as compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009. Loss from Discontinued Operations. Loss from discontinued operations of $1.3 million in fiscal 2008 related to the disposal of Longtop International Holdings Limited and our outsourcing business. There were no similar disposals in fiscal 2009. Net Income. As a result of the foregoing, we had net income of $43.5 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to a net income of $2.9 million in fiscal 2008.

As a result of these fluctuations, revenues, cost of revenues and resulting margins and operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of results for future quarterly periods, it is difficult for us to project our operating results for any quarter and we believe it is more meaningful to evaluate our business on an annual basis. Contributing factors include our clients annual procurement process and seasonality attributable to the Chinese New Year resulting in the quarters ended March 31 and June 30 generally being our lowest software development revenue quarters. In addition to our success selling our software solutions and services to new and existing customers and the impact of introducing new solutions and services and related timing, the mix of our software development revenues between standardized software sales and customized software sales significantly impact quarterly operating results. We recognize as revenue the full value of our standardized software solutions upfront, provided the other conditions of revenue recognition are satisfied. For our customized solutions, which require significant modification and customization, our cost of revenue is significantly higher than that for our standardized software solutions. In anticipation of our increased reliance on customized software solutions contracts in the near-term, as we produce our next generation of standardized software solutions, we have begun to add significant new headcount resulting in reduced margins. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, and which have maturities of three months or less that are placed with banks and other financial institutions.
