D. Risk Factors Any potential investor should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information contained in this annual report, before making an investment decision. These risk factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also harm our business. The trading price of our ordinary shares could decline due to any, some or all of these risks or other factors, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Increased competition has adversely affected our business and we remain subject to negative effects from regulatory constraints The Hong Kong Governments policies relating to the liberalization of the telecommunications industry in Hong Kong have resulted in increasing competition for us in the markets for local, broadband, mobile and international telecommunications services. In 1995, HKTCs monopoly on fixed-line telecommunications services expired, paving the way for granting new fixed telecommunications network services, or FTNS, licenses to us and three other fixed-line local carriers: Hutchison Global Communications Limited, New World Telecommunications Limited, or New World, and Wharf T&T Limited, or Wharf. The FTNS licenses are valid until 2010 and renewable for an additional period of up to 15 years at the discretion of the Telecommunications Authority, or TA. The Hong Kong Government also granted additional licenses in 2000 for the operation of FTNS over hybrid coaxial networks or local fixed networks based on wireless technologies. Six cellular companies, four of which hold 3G licenses, also operate in the market. One of these six companies is SUNDAY 3G (Hong Kong) Limited, or SUNDAY 3G, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SUNDAY. On January 1, 2003, full liberalization of the local and external FTNS markets took effect following a statement on the issue by the TA on January 11, 2002. See “Item 4.B. Business Overview―Regulation.” The introduction of full liberalization, alternative service providers and alternative technologies (e.g., Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP) for the provision of fixed-line services has increased and will continue to increase competition for us. With full liberalization, the grant of new licenses does not explicitly require capacity or infrastructure investment. However, no new FTNS licenses will be granted to those applicants who primarily rely on interconnection with and access to the infrastructure of other FTNS licensees to roll out their network or provide their services. Since full market liberalization in January 2003, severa l new wireline-based FTNS licenses have been granted. Consequently, our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected. Competition in the market for international direct dial, or IDD, services was initiated in 1999 as a result of the Hong Kong Governments issuance of external telecommunications services, or ETS, licenses to numerous providers. An ETS license gives the licensee the right to lease international private circuits from licensed international facility-based carriers at market rates for the operation of international call services. Further 6 competition with respect to the provision of international services from facilities-based carriers was initiated in 2000 as a result of the Hong Kong Governments granting of additional external fixed telecommunications network services, or EFTNS, licenses. Our market position in the retail market for IDD and other international services has also been affected by the presence of other service providers whose operations may be augmented through strategic alliances with global and/or foreign strategic partners and mobile telecommunications service providers. These developments may make the international retail market even more competitive in the future. Increased competition has resulted and may continue to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share, under-utilization of resources and additional promotional, marketing and customer acquisition expenses. These factors have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In addition, we may continue to restructure our telephony operations to reflect changes from a highly regulated environment to a highly competitive one. We could suffer material adverse effects on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, if we are unable to restructure our operations as required, or in time, to face these competitive challenges. We have previously taken substantial write-offs in light of competitive pressures and rapid advancements in technology and we can give no assurance that similar write-offs will not be required in the future. On January 14, 2005 we exchanged our FTNS license for a new Fixed Carrier, or FC, license. The primary change is our move from an ex ante tariff regime (where TA prior approval of all of our tariff revisions was required) to an ex post tariff regime (where we give the TA notice one day before we effectuate a tariff revision such as a discount, promotion or services bundle). The FC license does not contain any language that suggests we are dominant in any market. These changes were the result of our applications being declared non-dominant and our litigation strategy and will assist our ability to compete on a more level-playing field with other entrants. Nevertheless, our new license does not grant us non-dominance status. There is also a mandated local loop unbundling (i.e., Type II interconnection) requirement for narrowband (e.g., voice te lephony) and broadband (e.g., Internet access). Although it will be phased out by mid-2008, this has facilitated market share acquisition by the other entrants. Continued pricing pressure from our competitors and our new found ability to price competitively may lead to further price declines and more severe competition in the fixed line market. If we are not able to compete effectively within the constraints of our new FC license or if the TAs interpretation of the scope of constraints of the FC license is more stringent than our interpretation, our results of operations, market position and financial condition may be adversely affected. As a further step to monitor and regulate the telecommunications market, the Hong Kong Government enacted the Telecommunications (Amendment) Ordinance 2003, or the 2003 Ordinance, in July 2003, which deals specifically with merger and acquisition activities by carrier licensees in Hong Kongs telecommunications sector. The 2003 Ordinance gives the TA the power to review mergers and acquisitions concerning carrier licensees and to take appropriate actions when it determines that the transaction would substantially lessen market competition without any outweighing public benefits. The TA also has the right to impose additional conditions on the carrier licensee including unwinding the merger or acquisition. A de novo appeal to the Telecommunications (Competition Provisions) Appeal Board, or Competition Board, of the TAs decision is also part of the 2003 Ord inance. The 2003 Ordinance may have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our carrier and fixed line business through mergers and acquisitions. More generally, the Hong Kong telecommunications industry operates under licenses granted by the Office of the Telecommunications Authority in Hong Kong, or together with the TA, OFTA. Our operations could be adversely affected if any of our existing licenses are amended, not renewed or revoked. The industry will be more competitive if new licenses are granted by OFTA to other service providers. The effect of any future regulatory changes on the viability or competitiveness of our business cannot be accurately predicted. New regulatory developments may adversely affect our business Fixed mobile convergence The current regulatory framework in Hong Kong for fixed mobile interconnection is one of mobile party network pays, which essentially means that the mobile operator pays the fixed network operator for sending its 7 traffic to the fixed network operator and also pays the fixed network operator for receiving traffic from the fixed network operator. The practice elsewhere is generally for the originating network of traffic to pay the terminating network of traffic. OFTA has indicated that it will conduct a consultation on this issue which is expected to begin in mid 2006. It has retained a consultant to assist it in this proceeding. The outcome of such consultation and any resulting changes to the current interconnection regime may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Broadband Wireless Access In December 2004, the TA initiated a consultation on licensing broadband wireless access in the 3.4 to 3.6 GHz range. A second consultation was initiated in August 2005. We joined twelve other operators in questioning the timing and content of the TAs proposals. See Item 4.B. Business OverviewRegulation. While the TA is now conducting further discussions and testing with the industry, there can be no assurance that broadband wireless access will not be licensed as originally proposed which could cause significant interference with inbound satellite transmissions to Hong Kong and affect broadcasting, voice and data services. Such interference would adversely affect our quality of service, our reputation and revenues, and ultimately our results of operations. Spectrum Policy Review, or SPR In late 2004, the Commerce, Industry and Telecommunications Bureau indicated that the Hong Kong Government intended to review its spectrum policies in line with similar reviews undertaken in other markets. In addition to spectrum assignments, the review would be expected to address spectrum usage and trading, auctions, interference management and other issues. Depending on the outcome of this review, spectrum could be assigned, obtained, used and traded in a manner which could adversely affect our competitive position, revenues and margins. Universal Service Charges Universal service charges are charges which compensate a company for providing services to low income consumers and for installing and maintaining payphones situated throughout Hong Kong. The TA will likely initiate a consultation to review the manner in which universal service charges are calculated and recovered. The result of this consultation could further decrease revenues from universal service charges and adversely affect our results of operations. Our strategy to develop a profitable mobile business may not be successful On June 22, 2005, we acquired a 59.87% interest in SUNDAY, and thereafter launched a mandatory unconditional cash offer for all of the remaining shares of SUNDAY. We currently hold a 79.35% interest in SUNDAY. We expect SUNDAY to be the core of our mobile business and to help us achieve fixed mobile convergence. However, as a result of competition in the mobile telecommunications market, the costs of developing the 3G business and the limitations under the SEHK Listing Rules on business dealings between SUNDAY and us, we may be limited in our ability to develop a profitable mobile business. The Hong Kong mobile telecommunications market is intensely competitive with six operators providing 2G networks and four operators licensed to provide 3G networks. Hong Kong is one of the most saturated mobile telecommunications markets in the world, and only recently has some consolidation in the market commenced. Prior to its acquisition by us, SUNDAY had established a modest 2G business and had been investing to extend its range of services to encompass 3G services. Nonetheless, SUNDAY was the smallest of all the mobile operators in Hong Kong, with a market share of less than 10%, primarily limited to retail consumers. To successfully compete with the other competitors in the market, and in particular with its 3G investments, SUNDAY would need a relatively rapid adoption of 3G services by customers, a broader customer base, and increased funding to develop the 3 G business. If the intense competition in the market continues, if we are not successful in strengthening the customer base and growing the mobile business, or if there are insufficient funds available to finance the 3G business, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Our 3G competitors have launched their 3G services and have offered very substantial handset subsidies and attractive price promotions to attract new customers and to migrate existing 2G customers to 3G customers. 8 SUNDAY launched its trial 3G data card service in June 2005 and, in conjunction with us, trial-launched 3G services to our selected customers in early 2006. We face severe market competition in the 3G marketplace, and we expect that competition will continue to be intense as a result of the possible entry of new competitors on a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, resale or even facilities basis, consolidation of market leaders, possible unfavorable decisions in the SPR and OFTAs fixed mobile convergence consultation, and the rapid development of new technologies, products and services. There has recently been some consolidation in the mobile telecommunications market in Hong Kong, such as the acquisition of China Resources Peoples Telephone Company Limited, a competitor of ours, by China Mobile (Hong Kong) Limited in 2005, and the merger of Hong Kong CSL Limited and New World PCS Limited which the TA approved in March 2006. These trends and events may create additional pressure on our roaming revenues, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Further business combinations and alliances in the telecommunications industry may create significant new competitors and could harm our business and results of operations. Our ability to compete successfully, particularly with respect to our 3G investments, will depend on the speed of adoption of 3G services by customers, our ability to fund the development of our 3G business, and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in customer preferences, economic conditions and discount pricing strategies by competitors. If we are not successful in doing these things, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Both SUNDAY and we are companies subject to the SEHK Listing Rules. These rules require that certain significant transactions between a listed issuer and its connected persons, such as SUNDAY and us, be subject to disclosure and independent shareholders approval. On April 26, 2006, an extraordinary general meeting of SUNDAY was held to approve transactions to implement the new business model of SUNDAY, the detailed arrangements of which were made public. Unless connected transactions such as the arrangements underlying the new business model are approved by a majority of SUNDAYs independent shareholders, we may not be able to implement such arrangements, which could have material adverse effects on our business strategy and our operations. Additionally, as the detailed arrangements between SUNDAY and us are made public, including to our competitors, the effect on the competitiveness of our business cannot be accurately predicted. Risks associated with increased competition in the Hong Kong pay television market In mid 2003, we launched now TV in Hong Kong, an Internet protocol pay television service. At the end of 2005, we had over 500,000 subscribers and were the second largest pay television provider in Hong Kong in terms of subscriber numbers. We currently offer over 90 channels on now TV, which includes content from local and international content providers. The costs of content can be significant, particularly for exclusive content, and can increase as a result of competition among pay television providers for subscribers. Additionally, as competition for subscribers in the pay television market intensifies, price competition may heighten. Should we be unable to locate, develop or finance the acquisition of new content and retain the existing available content, and if competition in the industry intensifies, this could have a material adverse effect on our pay television business, our financial position and our results of operations. We may not be able to secure or successfully implement new business opportunities or anticipated projects with CNC On January 19, 2005, we, CNC and China Netcom Group Corporation (BVI) Limited, or CNC (BVI), a wholly owned subsidiary of CNC, entered into a subscription agreement (which was amended by a supplemental agreement dated February 7, 2005 between the same parties and a deed of assignment dated March 14, 2005 between the same parties and China Netcom Corporation (BVI) Limited, or China Netcom (BVI), a wholly owned subsidiary of CNC (BVI)), or CNC Subscription Agreement, whereby China Netcom (BVI) agreed to subscribe for 1,343,571,766 new ordinary shares to be issued by us. The new ordinary shares represented approximately 20% of our enlarged issued share capital. On April 1, 2005, CNC through China Netcom (BVI) completed this subscription and became our second largest shareholder. Pursuant to the CNC Subscription Agreement, we have set up a PRC Business Development Committee to advise on possible opportunities for expanding our operations in the PRC and monitor the use of funds allocated and approved by our Board of Directors or relevant committee for such opportunities. Subject to our capital investment 9 procedures and the identification of appropriate investment opportunities, we presently intend to seek to invest up to HK$5,000 million to expand our operations in the PRC. CNC has the right to nominate two out of four members of this committee. In addition, we and CNC entered into a memorandum on February 24, 2005, setting out the parties intention to establish special working teams to explore cooperation opportunities in areas including, inter alia, broadband media, mobile communications, property development and directory business. Although we have made some investments in these areas, we might not be able to secure or successfully implement the new business opportunities or anticipated projects with CNC due to business, economic, regulatory or other constraints and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Risks related to loss of business with competitors of CNC Pursuant to the CNC Subscription Agreement, we agreed in certain circumstances to discuss with CNC opportunities available to us with any entity licensed to provide fixed-line telecommunications services in the PRC relating to (1) the establishment of new joint ventures in the PRC in relation to (a) certain basic fixed-line telecommunications services which are considered of a strategic nature to us or involve a significant investment by us or (b) non-regulated services which involve a significant investment by us or (2) the disposal of a strategic business in the PRC. We are not bound to enter into any agreement with CNC or any member of the CNC group, or the CNC Group, as a preferred partner, and are not precluded from discussing or negotiating with any competitors of the CNC Group, or entering into any agreement or arrangement with them provided that we first not ify CNC of the opportunity and enter into good faith discussions with CNC if CNC expresses an interest in being our partner in the proposed business development opportunity or disposal. As CNC is our second largest shareholder and, in view of the above arrangements, our existing business relationship with competitors of CNC, such as China Telecommunications Corporation, or China Telecom, might be adversely affected, and our ability to develop new business relationships with competitors of CNC may be significantly impaired. As such, this could make us dependent on CNC for new business opportunities in the PRC. If we are unable for any reason to develop new business opportunities in the PRC, maintain existing business relationships in the PRC with competitors of CNC or if we and CNC fail to develop new business opportunities in the PRC, our existing businesses could be significantly disrupted and our expansion plans could be inhibited. As a result, the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operation. Risks associated with PCPD, our property development subsidiary, including the development of the Cyberport project and future property development plans In May 2000, we entered into an agreement with the Hong Kong Government under which we were granted the exclusive right and obligation to design, develop and construct the Cyberport project. See “Item 4.B. Business Overview―Infrastructure―Cyberport” for a more detailed discussion of this project. We have agreed to design, develop and construct the Cyberport project for a maximum fixed cost of approximately HK$15.8 billion, subject to certain adjustments, in accordance with an agreed timetable. The maximum fixed cost was based on a cost assessment conducted by professional quantity surveyors. We are obligated to fund the entire cost of the Cyberport project, as well as other project expenses, to the extent that these costs and expenses are not funded by the sale or pre-sale proceeds from residential units or other specified project income. We are also obligated to fund certain other expenses and any cost overruns, which include any costs above the maximum fixed cost. Cost overruns and these other expenses must be funded from our own resources and cannot be funded by pre-sale or sale proceeds from residential units or other project income. Under the relevant land grant from the Hong Kong Government, sale or pre-sale proceeds must be paid into a stakeholders account maintained by a designated law firm and be applied first towards the settlement of the development costs of the residential units. As at December 31, 2005, an amount of approximately of HK$4,293 million was standing to the credit of such stakeholders account. We expect that such amount will be sufficient to cover all development costs of the Cyberport project based on current estimates and the Group will not be required 10 to provide significant additional direct funding to the project. We have also agreed to indemnify the Hong Kong Government against certain losses, claims and expenses, and other items, including, for example, any losses caused by or arising as a result of our negligence or a breach by us of our obligations under the project agreement. This indemnity remains in effect following the transfer of our interest in Cyber-Port Limited, or the Cyberport Developer, to PCPD. The agreement may be terminated by the Hong Kong Government under certain circumstances, including upon our default on the agreement. As at December 31, 2005, we had invested approximately HK$4,428 million in the Cyberport project. Pre-sales of residential units in the first two phases commenced in 2003 and, despite difficult market conditions in Hong Kong, all 1,204 residential units were sold. Together with the phases launched in 2004 and 2005, more than 1,980 residential units had been sold by December 31, 2005. The cash flow generated from pre-sales of residential units are used to substantially cover existing and future development costs of the Cyberport project. No assurance can be given as to: • when pre-sales and sales of the residential units of future phases will begin, the pricing of these residential units or whether such sales and pre-sales will be successful as these will be affected by the then prevailing property market conditions and risks specific to the property market (including the property policy of the Hong Kong Government as modified and revised from time to time and the changes in interest rates applicable to the mortgage of properties); or • the amount we will have to fund with respect to the Cyberport project and other obligations under the project agreement; or • the level of failures by committed purchasers to complete the purchase of their residential units, of which we are aware of a small number; or • the amount of surplus proceeds, if any, which may ultimately be distributed to us from the Cyberport project. As a result, the above factors may have significant implications for our projections of internal cash flow for the Cyberport project. Were the amount of surplus proceeds from the project to fall below our expectations, or be allocated to us later than forecast, our financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected and our ability to expand our other businesses may be restricted. Various recent changes in the accounting standards in Hong Kong applicable to our infrastructure business could adversely affect our financial results. We own certain investment properties for investment potential, and the investment properties are stated in our balance sheet at their open market value. As a result of a new Hong Kong accounting standard relating to investment property that came into effect on January 1, 2005, any changes in fair value of the investment properties will be directly reported in PCPDs income statement. Accordingly, any reduction in the fair value of the investment properties would adversely affect our financial results. Prior to January 1, 2005, we used the stage of completion method in recognizing the revenues and profits from the pre-sales of residential units. As a result of a new interpretation of a Hong Kong accounting standard relating to revenue recognition that came into effect on January 1, 2005, revenue arising from pre-completion contracts for the sale of development properties entered into on or after January 1, 2005 should be recognized upon the completion of the development properties. We have designated completion to mean the date that the consent to assign the property has been issued by the Hong Kong Lands Department or, in cases where such consent to assign is not required, such other date on which the significant risks and rewards associated with the ownership of the property under the contract pass to the purchaser. Revenues and profits in respect of pre-completion contracts entered into before January 1, 2005, as permitted by the new interpretation, would continue to be recognized based on the stage of completion method. This may result in a deferral of revenue recognition from the pre-sales of residential units in future years and may adversely affect our financial results. On February 7, 2005, PCCW Tower was sold by Partner Link Investments Limited, or Partner Link, a wholly owned subsidiary of PCPD, for cash consideration of HK$2,808 million. Pursuant to a deed of rental guarantee, 11 Partner Link guaranteed a net rental of HK$13,338,000 per month to the purchaser for five years commencing on February 8, 2005, the date following the completion date of the sale. The purchaser appointed Pacific Century Paramount Real Estate Limited, or Pacific Century Paramount, another wholly owned subsidiary of PCPD, as the leasing agent and estate manager of PCCW Tower during the term of the deed of rental guarantee. The deed of rental guarantee can be terminated in limited circumstances, including if the appointment of Pacific Century Paramount as the leasing agent and estate manager is terminated by the purchaser. A payment to the purchaser under the rental guarantee arrangement could materially and adversely affect our prospects and financial position. From time to time, there is some public discussion in Hong Kong regarding the manner in which we were granted the right to participate in the Cyberport project. This could have an adverse effect on the expansion of our future property development plans such as the redevelopment of telephone exchange sites currently held under long-term leases which require approval from the Hong Kong Government, or on the negotiations with the Hong Kong Government for payment of land premium. Our substantial debt could impair our ability to implement our business plan We have incurred significant indebtedness and, subject to limitations imposed by our lenders, may incur indebtedness in the future. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately HK$29,357 million in short-term borrowings and long-term liabilities. As long as we have a substantial amount of debt, the consequences of this debt to our business, among other things, could be to: • limit our ability to take advantage of significant new business opportunities; • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations if market or operational conditions deteriorate; • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payment of our existing debt, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, development and other general corporate requirements; and • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. We are exposed to interest rate risk A significant portion of our outstanding debt and guarantee obligations bear interest at a fixed rate. As a result, any significant decrease in interest rates would not be reflected in our payment obligations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We will be susceptible to risks associated with expanding our operations outside Hong Kong, which could harm our operating results We plan to offer globally the network, operations and management experience and expertise that we have acquired in Hong Kong, particularly to clients and business partners in the PRC, Asia and the United Kingdom, or the U.K. We expect to commit substantial time and development resources to customizing and developing our products and services for markets outside of Hong Kong and to developing relevant sales and support channels. Our ability to expand into these markets may be constrained by the pace of deregulation in individual markets, including the timing of removal of restrictions on foreign participation. In addition, operations outside of Hong Kong will be subject to certain risks, including: • lack of familiarity with the overseas market, such as customer preferences and competitors practices; 12 • multiple and conflicting regulations relating to communications, use of data and control of Internet access; • changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and import and export restrictions, particularly in the PRC; • increased costs associated with complying with the laws of numerous jurisdictions; • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • lack of clarity in the interpretation of laws and regulations, particularly in the PRC; • insufficient protection of intellectual property rights, particularly in the PRC; • changes in political and economic stability; and • potentially adverse tax consequences. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business strategy involves potential business combinations, strategic investments and acquisitions As part of our business strategy, we intend to enter into new business combinations, strategic investments and acquisitions. However, we might not be able to enter into new business combinations, strategic investments and acquisitions due to regulatory or other constraints, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions typically involve a number of risks, including: • the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies; • the potential disruption to our ongoing business and the distraction of our management; • the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services; • unanticipated expenses related to acquired technologies and their integration into existing technologies; • the difficulty of maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; • the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new management and personnel; • potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses; • higher than planned funding requirements to preserve and grow the value of acquired companies or, if we are unable to obtain access to such funds, possible loss of value of the acquired companies; and • adverse effects on our reported operating results due to the amortization of and potential impairment provision for goodwill associated with acquisitions and losses sustained by acquired companies after the date of acquisitions. Our ability to introduce new technologies, to successfully respond to technological developments and to adapt existing technologies may be limited Our operations depend on the successful deployment of continuously evolving technologies, particularly in view of our expansion plans in the broadband market, the convergence of voice, data, video and multimedia on various platforms and responding to technological and industry developments. We cannot be certain that technologies will be developed in time to meet changing market conditions, that they will perform according to expectations or that they will achieve commercial acceptance. The failure of vendor performance or technology performance to meet our expectations or the failure of technology to achieve commercial 13 acceptance could mean that we have to make additional unexpected capital expenditures. In addition, we may not be able to adapt our services to changing market conditions or establish and maintain effective distribution channels for our services. Competitors may adapt more successfully to changing market conditions, establish more effective distribution channels or introduce technologies that make our products and services less competitive. We may be unable to continue to pay dividends in the future We undertook a capital reduction in 2004 in order to allow us to begin paying dividends. For further information, see Item 8.A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information  Dividend Policy. We commenced the payment of dividends in November 2004. However, there can be no assurance that dividends will be declared or paid in the future. We may be unable to, or our Board of Directors may decide not to, pay dividends on our ordinary shares. The declaration or payment of dividends will depend on various factors, including: • attaining positive retained earnings; • our future operations, capital requirements and surplus; • general economic, political and financial conditions; • contractual restrictions; • defeasance of certain outstanding liabilities of the Company; • the amount of any asset impairment; • investment and acquisition policy; and • other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur indebtedness that may prohibit or effectively restrict the payment of dividends. We will be susceptible to risks associated with Reach Ltd., or Reach, our primary international connectivity services provider Reach was formed in February 2001 as a 50:50 venture between Telstra Corporation Limited of Australia, or Telstra, and us and merged the respective international infrastructure assets of both shareholders. See Item 4.B. Business Overview―Reach”. On April 16, 2005, we agreed with Telstra and Reach on a new operating model under which Reach would operate as an outsourcer of telecommunications network services for our group and Telstra and its subsidiaries, or the Telstra Group. As a result of the implementation of this new operating model, Reachs aggregate indebtedness to us was reduced to US$155 million. Due to Reachs current financial condition, we may not receive interest on Reachs remaining indebtedness of US$155 million to us, we may not be able to recover a portion or all of such indebtedness and the US$25 million that we may be required to contribute under a revolving working capital loan facility which we and Telstra agreed to provide in 2004, or the Reach Working Capital Facility, and we may need to restructure Reachs remaining indebtedness of US$155 million to us and the Reac h Working Capital Facility. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For further details on the new operating model for Reach, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects―Transactions with Related Parties.” Our long-term contractual commitments to Reach could affect us in a number of ways, including by: • committing us to fund Reach’s committed payments, which we expect over the 17-year period from March 2005 to 2022 to be approximately US$106 million; 14 • committing us to pay for services from Reach in respect of the indefeasible rights to use the international undersea capacity acquired in April 2005 until the expiry of such rights irrespective of our actual use of such services; • committing us to ensure that Reach continues to operate in the long term as a provider of services to us and Telstra, which may result in further requirements to fund Reach either in the form of debt or equity; and • requiring us to continue to work with Telstra on a joint venture basis and to continue to address any funding issues for the joint venture should they arise, failing which we could lose our ability to use the indefeasible rights to the international undersea capacity acquired in April 2005. In particular, if Reach were unable for any reason to provide us with the services described above, this could disrupt our business. As a result of the above factors, our relationship with Reach could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. Any asset impairment could adversely affect our financial results We own property, plant and equipment, interests in leasehold land held for our own use under operating leases, investments in associates and jointly controlled companies, intangible assets and goodwill and are required to review these assets for impairment at the end of each financial year with reference to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value-in-use. If the carrying value of an asset is higher than its recoverable amount, asset impairment will be charged to the income statement. The recoverable amount is dependent on the prevailing market conditions, nature of the asset, its resale value, its estimated future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money, our ability to deliver business plans and the risks specific to the asset. The c arrying value of property, plant and equipment, interests in leasehold land held for our own use under operating leases, interests in associates and jointly controlled companies, intangible assets and goodwill at December 31, 2005 were HK$16,012 million, HK$661 million, HK$705 million, HK$1,326 million and HK$2,661 million, respectively. As such, any reduction in the recoverable amount of an asset below its carrying value could be charged to the income statement and could adversely affect our financial results. Risk of earnings volatility from the adoption of HKFRSs In order to achieve convergence with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the HKICPA has issued a number of new and revised HKFRSs that became effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005. These new and revised HKFRSs were reflected in our financial statements for the first time for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of the new and revised HKFRSs has no impact on our underlying business operations or cash flow. However, our financial results as reported under these HKFRSs in the income statement may fluctuate significantly. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this matter. The development of VoIP services in Hong Kong could adversely affect us On June 20, 2005, the TA released its policy statement on the regulation of VoIP services in Hong Kong. The TA adopted a two tier licensing regime for VoIP providers and indicated that the first tier providers would have similar rights and obligations as the current FTNS/FC licensees as they would be providing a substitutable voice service. The second tier providers would have fewer rights and obligations, as they would be offering services that would not be substitutable for existing voice services. See Item 4.B. Business Overview Regulation. Depending on the outcome of commercial negotiations and the additional consultations on VoIP services, and the speed at which competitors may offer products to the market, VoIP services could pose a serious competitive threat to our fixed line and IDD business, resulting in reduced revenues and margins. 15 Our business activities in the broadband multimedia and integrated solutions services markets may not be successful We offer broadband multimedia and integrated solutions services in Hong Kong and in overseas markets. These services include wireless broadband Internet access, pay television, consulting, systems development, systems integration, data hosting, web applications and design, outsourcing and managed services and applications service provision. We face many competitors in these areas. A number of our competitors have greater resources and better international brand identity than we do. Many of our competitors have potential advantages over us in the provision of integrated solutions services, including: • longer operating histories; • greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources; • greater name recognition; and • larger customer bases. We expect to commit substantial time and resources to customizing and developing our products and services and to developing relevant sales and support channels. These efforts may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in these areas. In particular, certain technical services contracts which we have with the Hong Kong Government will soon expire and be subject to renegotiation. Any failure to renew such contracts would adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to pursue our strategy with respect to some investments in which we share control or do not have a controlling interest may be limited We have formed ventures with business partners in which we share control or do not have a controlling interest. Our current and future venture interests may involve special risks, including, among others, the possibility that: • a venture partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; • a venture partner or the venture may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to our businesses; • a venture partner may be unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations under the venture agreements; • a venture partner may experience financial difficulties; and • we may not be in a position to control the ventures future growth strategy or operations or its distribution of available cash flows to the same extent it would if it were a subsidiary. Any disputes which may arise over venture obligations or otherwise could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of these ventures. In addition, our current debt burden may restrict our ability to provide further funding to these businesses if the need arises. As a result, there may be a dilution of our interests in such businesses and in our ability to influence their development. Loss of key management and other qualified personnel could weaken our business A small group of key executive officers manages us, and the loss of services of one or more of these key individuals could affect our ability to make successful strategic decisions. Members of our senior management, including our executive directors, have entered into service contracts with us. The contracts with our key executive officers are terminable with notice periods ranging from three to twelve months. We cannot guarantee that these 16 contracts will allow us to retain key employees. Additionally, we do not presently maintain any key person insurance. Our management believes that our growth and success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified managerial, sales, marketing, administrative, operating and technical personnel. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to find additional qualified personnel, could materially and adversely affect our prospects and financial position. Regulatory decisions relating to broadband access services could adversely affect us In November 2000, the TA issued a statement on the regulatory framework for broadband interconnection, including the principles underlying the determination of broadband unbundled local loop arrangements and interconnection charges. Following the approval of OFTA, on October 19, 2001, we published a new wholesale tariff which sets out the terms and conditions upon which other FTNS operators in Hong Kong can interconnect with our copper local loops on an unbundled basis to provide broadband services. Following a series of litigation cases, we have now entered into long term contract and/or tariff arrangements with our three major competitors for unbundled local loops. Any determination of these terms, conditions and rates could pose a competitive threat to our narrowband, broadband and private line businesses, resulting in reduced revenues and margins. The Type II interconnection review was a public consultation initiated by the Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology of the Hong Kong Government on May 23, 2003 to review the policy of compulsory unbundling of local loops due to the changing market landscape, the advent of new or improved technologies and the fact that seven years have passed since narrowband unbundling was implemented. On July 6, 2004, the Executive Council released its decision to ultimately phase out both narrowband and broadband compulsory unbundled local loop by June 30, 2008. In 2005, we entered into a long term supply agreement with Wharf. Nevertheless, until mid-2008 when compulsory local loop unbundling will be withdrawn, any determination proceeding or further actions by the Hong Kong Government may mandate pricing and terms and conditions which, if less favorable to us than those provided in the published tariff, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the Interconnection and Related Competition Issues Statement No. 7 (Second Revision) published on March 18, 2002, OFTA completed a review of its interconnection charging principles initially established in 1995. In Statement No. 7, OFTA reconfirmed that in future determinations for Type II interconnection and Type I interconnection (i.e., interconnection between network gateways) it would continue to use a long run average incremental cost, or LRAIC, approach and apply a current cost standard subject to the use of historical cost on certain items (land, building, copper infrastructure pre-1995) to the costing of network assets. On June 18, 2002, OFTA indicated it could further revise Statement No. 7 to make it applicable to both broadband and narrowband interconnections. On November 12, 2004, OFTA announced that it would review the charging methodology for mobile and value added service interconnection to our FTNS network. See Item 4.B. Business Overview  Regulation. These reviews may result in interconnection charge levels less than those currently in existence and may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. A possible merger of the TA and the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority in 2007 or 2008 and the creation of a new regulator Our telecommunications and pay television/Internet businesses are currently regulated by the TA and the Broadcasting Authority, respectively. It has been publicly announced that the two regulators may be merged into a Communications Authority, which will likely occur in 2007 or 2008. It is unclear whether any of the underlying legislation may be amended or replaced, and whether there may be shifts in the current regulatory positions as a consequence. Any shift in such positions or change in legislation could adversely affect our results of operations. We may not be able to implement anticipated projects if we cannot obtain additional capital We expect to make substantial investments to develop our various businesses, maintain and upgrade our local fixed-line network and market our new and existing services. Accordingly, our operating and capital expenditures in future years may be as high as, or higher than, expenditures in the past. 17 We may find it difficult to generate sufficient internal funds to finance the full extent of these businesses financial requirements. If our operating cash flow does not grow as expected, it is likely that we will need to raise additional financing. Moreover, we may need to raise additional funds through private or public equity or debt financings to fully implement our intended investment plans within our proposed time frame and to fund operating losses in some of our business lines. Given the level of debt which we have committed through bond issues, term loans and working capital facilities, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all for our future expected capital commitments and expenditures. If we cannot raise sufficient additional funds on commercially acceptable terms, we may need to delay or abandon some of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities. We may not be able to realize an adequate return on some of our investments We have invested in early-stage companies in highly volatile industries, with limited operating histories and limited or no revenues. The value of our investments in these businesses may change due to the fluctuating and possible further diminution in value of these holdings. In addition, we will not be able to control or influence the management of the businesses in which we hold minority interests. We may need to invest additional capital in certain of these businesses to permit these businesses to implement their strategies. These businesses ultimately may not be successful. As a result, we may suffer losses because of such investments. We may be assessed taxes from previous years as a result of a dispute with the Inland Revenue Department HKTC is in dispute with Hong Kongs Inland Revenue Department, or IRD, regarding the deductibility of certain finance expenses. The IRD had raised two assessments for part of the disputed finance expenses on April 21, 2005 and February 3, 2006. HKTC lodged an objection to both assessments and successfully obtained a holdover of the tax assessed through the purchase of Tax Reserve Certificates in the amount of HK$308 million. The estimated impact on our tax expense of the dispute may amount to HK$322 million as of December 31, 2005. Based on the information available to date, HKTC has made a provision in 2005 based on the best estimate of the amount that may ultimately be required to settle this dispute. However, if HKTC ultimately loses the dispute and the settlement is more than the tax provided, it could adversely affect our results o f operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud The United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such companys internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal controls over financial reporting. These requirements will first apply to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective. Moreover, even if our managem ent concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still decline to attest to our managements assessment or may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. Furthermore, during the course of the evaluation, documentation and attestation, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remedy in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls, on an ongoing basis, over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessa ry for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur 18 considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An outbreak of bird flu or H5N1 or a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, or other similar outbreaks in the PRC, Hong Kong or certain other Asian countries, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition There have been reports of outbreaks of a highly pathogenic bird flu caused by the H5N1 virus in certain regions of Asia and Europe, with human casualties reported in Cambodia, the PRC, Indonesia, Iraq, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. In the first half of 2003, the PRC, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and certain other Asian countries encountered an outbreak of SARS, a highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia. In April 2004, there were several confirmed cases of SARS in Beijing. The recurrence of the SARS outbreak, or an outbreak of H5N1 or bird flu, or other similar outbreaks in the PRC, Hong Kong or certain other Asian countries may adversely affect our ability to conduct business development, in particular, in Asia. A recurrence or any similar outbreak may have an adverse effect on our customers and the demand for our products and services due to a general slowdow n of the economy and their prolonged effects may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be held liable for information retrieved from or sent through our Internet website Since our mobile communications and data services can be used to download and distribute information to others, there is a risk that we may face claims for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of such material. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type, or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by our insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our shares may be deregistered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act and our ADSs may be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange Inc., or the NYSE The SEC has announced a proposal to relax the requirements for deregistration of securities of foreign issuers such as us under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act. The SEC is considering comments it has received on the proposal and we cannot assure you that our shares will not be deregistered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act or our ADSs will not be delisted from the NYSE. If our shares were deregistered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act, we would no longer be subject to its periodic reporting requirements and holders of our shares and ADSs would need to rely on information we make public in Hong Kong pursuant to the requirements of the SEHK. Delisting of our ADSs from the NYSE would also adversely affect the liquidity of your ADSs. Hong Kongs relationship with the rest of the PRC is unpredictable and could disrupt our business Hong Kong is a special administrative region of the PRC with its own government. Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy from the PRC under the principle of one country, two systems. However, there can be no assurance that our financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected as a consequence of the exercise of the Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. Almost all of our operating assets are located in Hong Kong and a majority of our turnover is derived from operations conducted in Hong Kong. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political situation in Hong Kong and by the general state of the Hong Kong economy and the economies of the surrounding region, particularly the PRC. An economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations From mid-1997 to 2004, many countries in Asia experienced significant economic downturns and related financial difficulties. The decline in the value of most Asian currencies has led to many Asian companies experiencing difficulties servicing foreign currency-denominated debt and thereby defaulting on their debt payments. The economic crisis adversely affected domestic growth rates across the Asia-Pacific region. While economic conditions in many of these countries have improved, our business, results of operations and financial 19 condition could be materially and adversely affected if there are economic downturns in these Asian or other countries in the future. Currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations Although a major part of our outstanding debt and guarantee obligations are denominated in currencies other than Hong Kong dollars, we have entered into a series of hedging transactions to swap these liabilities back into the Hong Kong dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the US dollar since 1983. However, there is no assurance that such a peg will be maintained in the future. Therefore our results of operations and ability to discharge our obligations could be adversely affected by the discontinuation or revaluation of the peg between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar. Risks relating to complicated transactions and contractual arrangements We have entered into a number of complicated transactions and contractual arrangements. These include, among other things, financing and other contracts and instruments, joint ventures, investments, acquisitions and sales agreements and other contractual arrangements. These transactions and contractual arrangements could give rise to differences in interpretation, disputes, claims or other developments which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Shareholders interests may be diluted in the future Our Board of Directors may determine to raise additional financing by offering our ordinary shares or other equity-linked securities to third parties or to our existing shareholders on a non-pro rata basis. Ordinary shares may also be offered as consideration for the acquisition of assets. In addition, we may issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges that rank senior to our ordinary shares. As a result, shareholders interest in us may be diluted and/or become less advantageous as compared to the rights of other security holders. Exercise of influence over us by our Chairman or CNC may conflict with the interests of other holders of our shares and ADSs Li Tzar Kai, Richard is our Chairman and is also chairman and chief executive of the Pacific Century Group and chairman of Pacific Century Regional Developments Limited, or PCRD. As at April 30, 2006, Li Tzar Kai, Richard was deemed to be interested in approximately 26.48% of our issued share capital under the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Ordinance, or the HKSFO. See Item 6.E.Share Ownership. As a result, Li Tzar Kai, Richard may be considered to have significant influence over us. In addition, as at April 30, 2006, CNC held, through China Netcom (BVI), approximately 20% of our issued share capital. See Item 7.A. Major Shareholders. Additionally, as at April 30, 2006, CNC held more than 70% of China Netcom Group Corporation (Hong Kong) Limited, or CNC HK, a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of CNC, which also engages in telecommunications activities in the PRC and Asia-Pacific. As such, CNC might face a potential conflict of interest if there are new business opportunities which are suitable to CNC HK and us. Major business decisions, such as our expansion and investment decisions and changes to our legal and capital structure, require the approval of our Board of Directors. Li Tzar Kai, Richard and/or CNC may be considered to be able to influence these decisions and other matters relating to us. The interests of Li Tzar Kai, Richard or CNC may conflict with the interests of other holders of our shares and ADSs. Further, any such influence of Li Tzar Kai, Richard or CNC, if exercised, may: • delay or prevent a change in control of PCCW; • impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving PCCW; or • discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of PCCW. Although we believe that our relationships with Li Tzar Kai, Richard, the Pacific Century Group and CNC 20 provide us with significant business advantages, these relationships result in various related party, or connected transactions. See Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions for more details. Further, the interests of Li Tzar Kai, Richard may conflict with the interests of CNC as a majority shareholder of CNC HK which may inhibit our operations and delay the process in implementing or developing new business opportunities and this could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. The rights of shareholders under Hong Kong law are different from those under the law of other countries We are a limited company organized under the laws of Hong Kong. The rights of holders of our ordinary shares (including ordinary shares underlying our ADSs) are governed by Hong Kong law and by our Memorandum and Articles of Association. These rights may differ from and, in certain circumstances, be more limited than, the rights of shareholders in corporations incorporated in other countries. For example, a shareholder may only bring a derivative action against us in certain circumstances allowed under Hong Kong law. In addition, the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Hong Kong law may not be as clearly established as, or may receive different interpretation than, under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain jurisdictions in the U.S. The regime for business combinations and similar transactions in Hong Kong is different from that in th e U.S. These differences may affect the rights of minority shareholders in a business combination. You may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings We may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under the deposit agreement, the depositary will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities underlying these rights are either exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. We can give no assurance that we can establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have a registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result. If the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights.
