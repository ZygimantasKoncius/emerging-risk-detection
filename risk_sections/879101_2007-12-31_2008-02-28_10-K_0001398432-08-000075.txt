Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to certain business risks including, among other factors, the following: Loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a REIT and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. New legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. There can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT: · we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; · we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; 13 · unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and · we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities. Adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain properties. The economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: · changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; · local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; · the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; · the ability of tenants to pay rent; · competition from other available properties; · changes in market rental rates; · the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; · changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; · the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and · changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. Downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. Our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. Our performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally. The market for retail space could in the future be adversely affected by: · weakness in the national, regional and local economies; · the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; · ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; · the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and · increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. Failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise, could impact our performance. 14 Our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. At any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. As a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. In addition, lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. In that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all. The occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could impact our performance. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. A tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. A bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds, if at all. We may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. Real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. In addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a REITs ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. Therefore, we may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. We face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert managements attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that it has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. There is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. As we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. In addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. We may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. Also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. We do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. 15 We have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. In these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. As a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with us, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. The co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt. We may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in losses to us. Our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. We have significant international operations that carry additional risks. We invest in, and conduct operations outside the United States. The risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: · currency risks, including currency fluctuations; · unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; · potential adverse tax burdens; · burdens of complying with different permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; · obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; · regional, national and local political uncertainty; · economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; · difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and · reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. Each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which may have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations, and our financial condition. Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain it on favorable terms. The inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: · We could have difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which could materially adversely affect our business strategy; · Our liquidity could be adversely affected; · We may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; · We may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and · We may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. Financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. In addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We may be subject to environmental regulations. Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. We face competition in leasing or developing properties. 16 We face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than us. This results in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: · the extent of institutional investor interest in us; · the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; · the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); · our financial condition and performance; · the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; · an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and · general economic and financial market conditions. We may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in losses to us. Our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in losses to us. Marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. As a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: · limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; · substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; · subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; · the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and · the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. These risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. We invest in mortgage receivables. Our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. In the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. Delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. Furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. A decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. 17 Our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. In these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. In these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. In the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2. Properties Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31, 2007, the Company's real estate portfolio was comprised of interests in approximately 154.6 million square feet of GLA in 1,391 operating properties primarily consisting of neighborhood and community shopping centers, and 19 retail store leases located in 45 states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Chile. This 154.6 million square feet of GLA does not include 17 properties under development comprising 2.5 million square feet of GLA related to the Preferred Equity program, 30 property interest comprising 0.6 million square feet of GLA related to FNC Realty, 401 property interests comprising 2.3 million square feet of GLA related to a net lease portfolio, 55 property interest comprising 2.8 million square feet of GLA related to the NewKirk Portfolio and 20.5 million square feet of planned GLA for 60 ground-up development projects. The Companys portfolio includes interests ranging from 5% to 50% in 471 shopping center properties comprising approximately 72.4 million square feet of GLA relating to the Companys investment management programs and other joint ventures. Neighborhood and community shopping centers comprise the primary focus of the Company's current portfolio. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys total shopping center portfolio, representing 100% of total GLA of 124.0 million from 886 properties, was approximately 96.3% leased. The Company's neighborhood and community shopping center properties, which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures, had an average size of approximately 140,000 square feet as of December 31, 2007. The Company generally retains its shopping centers for long-term investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties. These projects usually include renovating existing facades, installing uniform signage, resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting. During 2007, the Company capitalized approximately $9.1 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately $19.7 million. The Company's neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually "anchored" by a national or regional discount department store, supermarket or drugstore. As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners and operators of shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers. Some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the Company's shopping center properties include The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Linens N Things, Royal Ahold, Bed Bath and Beyond, and Costco. A substantial portion of the Company's income consists of rent received under long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed-base rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers. Although many of the leases require the Company to make roof and structural repairs as needed, a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant, and the Company's standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance. The Company's management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties. Approximately 24.3% of the Company's leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds. Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the Company's revenues from rental property for the year ended December 31, 2007. Minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 99% of the Company's total revenues from rental property for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company's management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the Company's existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing market-rate base rents in the geographic regions where the Company operates, reflecting the potential for future growth. 18 For the period January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007, the Company increased the average base rent per leased square foot in its consolidated portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers from $9.86 to $10.30, an increase of $0.44. This increase primarily consists of (i) a $0.25 increase relating to acquisitions, (ii) a $0.07 increase relating to dispositions or the transfer of properties to various joint venture entities and (iii) a $0.12 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent step-ups within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys consolidated portfolio was 95.9% leased. The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through geographic and tenant diversity. No single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 0.8% of the Company's total shopping center GLA or more than 1.7% of total annualized base rental revenues as of December 31, 2007. The Companys five largest tenants at December 31, 2007, were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Wal-Mart, which represent approximately 3.2%, 2.8%, 2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. The Company maintains an active leasing and capital improvement program that, combined with the high quality of the locations, has made, in management's opinion, the Company's properties attractive to tenants. The Company's management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners. Retail Store Leases In addition to neighborhood and community shopping centers, as of December 31, 2007, the Company had interests in retail store leases totaling approximately 1.8 million square feet of anchor stores in 19 neighborhood and community shopping centers located in 13 states. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 97.4% of the space in these anchor stores had been sublet to retailers that lease the stores under net lease agreements providing for average annualized base rental payments of $4.09 per square foot. The average annualized base rental payments under the Companys retail store leases to the landowners of such subleased stores are approximately $2.54 per square foot. The average remaining primary term of the retail store leases (and, similarly, the remaining primary term of the sublease agreements with the tenants currently leasing such space) is approximately two years, excluding options to renew the leases for terms which generally range from five years to 20 years. The Companys investment in retail store leases is included in the caption Other real estate investments on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Ground-Leased Properties The Company has interests in 79 shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company (or an affiliated joint venture) to construct and/or operate a shopping center. The Company or the joint venture pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements. At the end of these long-term leases, unless extended, the land together with all improvements revert to the landowner. Ground-Up Development Properties The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects which consists of (i) merchant building through the Companys wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which develop neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Mexico for long-term investment (see Recent Developments - International Real Estate Investments and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). The ground-up development projects generally have significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of the construction. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress a total of 60 ground-up development projects including 27 merchant building projects, nine U.S. ground-up development projects and 24 ground-up development projects located throughout Mexico. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress 27 merchant building projects located in 13 states, which are expected to be sold upon completion. These projects had significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2007, the average annual base rent per leased square foot for the merchant building portfolio was $16.48 and the average annual base rent per leased square foot for new leases executed in 2007 was $18.19. Undeveloped Land The Company owns certain unimproved land tracts and parcels of land adjacent to certain of its existing shopping centers that are held for possible expansion. At times, should circumstances warrant, the Company may develop or dispose of these parcels. 19 The table on pages 21 through 33 sets forth more specific information with respect to each of the Company's property interests. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is not presently involved in any litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any litigation threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries that, in management's opinion, would result in any material adverse effect on the Company's ownership, management or operation of its properties taken as a whole, or which is not covered by the Company's liability insurance.

Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters Market Information The following sets forth the common stock offerings completed by the Company during the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. The Companys common stock was sold for cash at the following offering price per share: Offering Date Offering Price March 2006 $40.80 The table below sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share reported on the NYSE Composite Tape and declared dividends per share for the Companys common stock. The Companys common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "KIM". Stock Price Period High Low Dividends 2007: First Quarter $53.60 $43.59 $0.360 Second Quarter $50.36 $36.92 $0.360 Third Quarter $47.58 $33.74 $0.400 Fourth Quarter $47.69 $34.74 $0.400 (a) 2006: First Quarter $42.00 $32.02 $0.330 Second Quarter $40.57 $34.20 $0.330 Third Quarter $43.15 $36.18 $0.360 Fourth Quarter $47.13 $42.13 $0.360 (b) (a) Paid on January 15, 2008, to stockholders of record on January 2, 2008. (b) Paid on January 16, 2007, to stockholders of record on January 2, 2007. Holders The number of holders of record of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, was 3,442 as of January 31, 2008. Dividends Since the IPO, the Company has paid regular quarterly dividends to its stockholders. While the Company intends to continue paying regular quarterly dividends, future dividend declarations will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the actual cash flow of the Company, its financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Company is required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income. The actual cash flow available to pay dividends will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues received from rental properties, the operating expenses of the Company, the interest expense on its borrowings, the ability of lessees to meet their obligations to the Company and any unanticipated capital expenditures. The Company has determined that the $1.48 dividend per common share paid during 2007 represented 56% ordinary income, 35% in capital gains and a 9% return of capital to its stockholders. The $1.35 dividend per common share paid during 2006 represented 66% ordinary income, 28% in capital gains and a 6% return of capital to its stockholders. In addition to its common stock offerings, the Company has capitalized the growth in its business through the issuance of unsecured fixed and floating-rate medium-term notes, underwritten bonds, mortgage debt and construction loans, convertible preferred stock and perpetual preferred stock. Borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities have also been an interim source of funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short-term working capital requirements. The various instruments governing the Company's issuance of its unsecured public debt, bank debt, mortgage debt and preferred stock impose certain restrictions on the Company with regard to dividends, voting, liquidation and other preferential rights available to the holders of such instruments. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Notes 11 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. 36 The Company does not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of its Class F Preferred Stock and Class G Preferred Stock, the financial covenants contained in its public bond indentures, as amended, or its revolving credit agreements will have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to pay dividends in the normal course to its common stockholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which common and preferred stockholders and other interested investors may elect to automatically reinvest their dividends to purchase shares of the Companys common stock or, through optional cash payments, purchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Company may, from time-to-time, either (i) purchase shares of its common stock in the open market or (ii) issue new shares of its common stock for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under the Plan. Total Stockholder Return Performance The following performance chart compares, over the five years ended December 31, 2007, the cumulative total stockholder return on the Companys common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the cumulative total return of the NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return Index (the "NAREIT Equity Index") prepared and published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). Equity real estate investment trusts are defined as those which derive more than 75% of their income from equity investments in real estate assets. The NAREIT Equity Index includes all tax qualified equity real estate investment trusts listed on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System. Stockholder return performance, presented quarterly for the five years ended December 31, 2007, is not necessarily indicative of future results. All stockholder return performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Item 6. Selected Financial Data The following table sets forth selected, historical, consolidated financial data for the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and Notes thereto and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company believes that the book value of its real estate assets, which reflects the historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated depreciation, is not indicative of the current market value of its properties. Historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating performance. 37 Year ended December 31, (2) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands, except per share information) Operating Data: Revenues from rental property (1) $ 681,553 $ 587,547 $ 501,569 $ 488,021 $ 446,096 Interest expense (3) $ 213,674 $ 170,677 $ 126,432 $ 105,898 $ 101,351 Depreciation and amortization (3) $ 189,650 $ 139,263 $ 100,517 $ 94,651 $ 78,817 Gain on sale of development properties (4) $ 40,099 $ 37,276 $ 33,636 $ 16,835 $ 17,495 Gain on transfer/sale of operating properties, net (3) $ 2,708 $ 2,460 $ 2,833 $ - $ 3,177 Benefit for income taxes (5) $ 30,346 $ - $ - $ - $ - Provision for income taxes (6) $ - $ 17,253 $ 10,989 $ 8,320 $ 8,514 Income from continuing operations (7) $ 361,934 $ 345,309 $ 324,894 $ 273,393 $ 234,195 Income per common share, from continuing operations: Basic $ 1.36 $ 1.39 $ 1.38 $ 1.17 $ 0.99 Diluted $ 1.33 $ 1.36 $ 1.36 $ 1.15 $ 0.97 Weighted average number of shares of common stock: Basic 252,129 239,552 226,641 222,859 214,184 Diluted 257,058 244,615 230,868 227,143 217,540 Cash dividends declared per common share $ 1.52 $ 1.38 $ $1.27 $ 1.16 $ 1.10 December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Balance Sheet Data: $ 7,325,035 $ 6,001,319 $ 4,560,406 $ 4,092,222 $ 4,174,664 Real estate, before accumulated depreciation $ 9,097,816 $ 7,869,280 $ 5,534,636 $ 4,749,597 $ 4,641,092 Total assets $ 4,216,415 $ 3,587,243 $ 2,691,196 $ 2,118,622 $ 2,154,948 Total debt $ 3,894,574 $ 3,366,959 $ 2,387,214 $ 2,236,400 $ 2,135,846 Total stockholders' equity Cash flow provided by operations $ 665,989 $ 455,569 $ 410,797 $ 365,176 $ 308,632 Cash flow used for investing activities $ (1,507,611) $ (246,221) $ (716,015) $ (299,597) $ (637,636) Cash flow provided by (used for) financing activities $ $584,056 $ 59,444 $ 343,271 $ (75,647) $ 341,330 (1) Does not include (i) revenues from rental property relating to unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) revenues relating to the investment in retail stores leases and (iii) revenues from properties included in discontinued operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. Executive Summary Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nations largest publicly-traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had interests in 1,973 properties totaling approximately 183 million square feet of GLA located in 45 states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Chile. The Company is self-administered and self-managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 45 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company. In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate-related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services, which primarily focus on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise. In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company also makes selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in managements judgment, priced below the value of the underlying real estate. The Companys strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and dividends. As a result of the improved 2007 performance, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.40 from $0.36, effective for the third quarter of 2007. Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). The Company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial 39 statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate, joint venture investments and realizability of deferred tax assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Real Estate The Companys investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (primarily consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (primarily consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships), assumed debt and redeemable units issued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings and building improvements 15 to 50 years Fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements Terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter (including certain identified intangible assets) The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income. Real estate under development on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments. These assets are carried at cost. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the 40 completion of major construction activity. If, in managements opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable, based upon an allocation of the investments net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. The Companys joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Companys exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment, and due to the lenders exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. The Companys exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments. On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investments value is impaired only if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Long Lived Assets On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if managements estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of impairments and/or valuation allowances. Results of Operations Comparison 2007 to 2006 2007 2006 Increase/(Decrease) % change (all amounts in thousands) Revenues from rental property (1) $ 681.6 $ 587.5 $ 94.1 16.0% Rental property expenses: (2) Rent $ 12.1 $ 11.5 $ 0.6 5.2% Real estate taxes 83.6 74.6 9.0 12.1% Operating and maintenance 90.0 72.7 17.3 23.8% $ 185.7 $ 158.8 $ 26.9 16.9% Depreciation and amortization (3) $ 189.7 $ 139.3 $ 50.4 36.2% 41 (1) Revenues from rental property increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2006 and 2007, providing incremental revenues of approximately $85.5 million, (ii) an overall occupancy increase from the consolidated shopping center portfolio to 95.9% at December 31, 2007, as compared to 95.1% at December 31, 2006, due to growth in rental rates from renewing expiring leases, the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the corresponding period in 2006, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the corresponding period in 2006, resulting from the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities, and the sale of certain properties during 2007 and 2006. (2) Rental property expenses increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2007 and 2006 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. (3) Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2007 and 2006 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income decreased $4.6 million to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $18.8 million for the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to the recognition of accretion income of approximately $6.2 million, resulting from the early prepayment of a mortgage receivable in 2006 partially offset by an overall increase in interest income on mortgage receivables entered into in 2007 and 2006. Management and other fee income increased approximately $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased property management fees and other transaction related fees related to the growth in the Companys co-investment programs. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to personnel-related costs, primarily due to growth within the Companys co-investment programs and the overall continued growth of the Company. Interest, dividends and other investment income decreased approximately $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in realized gains resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities during 2007 as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. Other (expense)/income, net decreased approximately $19.5 million to $10.6 million of an expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $8.9 million in income for the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to (i) the receipt of fewer shares during 2007 as compared to 2006 of Sears Holding Corp. common stock received as partial settlement of Kmart pre-petition claims and (ii) an increase in Canadian withholding charges on profit participation proceeds received during 2007 relating to capital transactions from a Canadian preferred equity investment. Interest expense increased approximately $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is due to higher interest rates and higher outstanding levels of debt during the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the same period in 2006. Benefit for income taxes increased $48.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to the reduction of approximately $31.2 million of NOL valuation allowance and a tax benefit of approximately $10.1 million from operating losses recognized in connection with the Albertsons investment. 42 Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $67.8 million to $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $105.5 million for the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily the result of (i) an increase in equity in income from the Kimco Realty Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP") joint venture investment primarily resulting from profit participation of approximately $39.3 million and gains on sale/transfer of operating properties during 2007 of which the Companys share of gains were $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, (ii) an increase in equity in income from the Kimco Income Opportunity Portfolio ("KIR") joint venture investment primarily resulting from gains on sale of operating properties during 2007 of which the Companys share of gains was $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and (iii) the Companys growth of its various other real estate joint ventures due to additional capital investments for the acquisition of additional operating properties by the ventures throughout 2007 and 2006, partially offset by net operating losses and excess cash distribution from the Albertsons joint venture of approximately $7.9 million during 2007. During 2007, the Company sold, in separate transactions, (i) four recently completed merchant building projects, (ii) 26 out-parcels, (iii) 74.3 acres of undeveloped land and (iv) completed partial sales of two projects, for aggregate total proceeds of approximately $310.5 million and approximately $3.3 million of proceeds from completed earn-out requirements on previously sold projects. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $24.1 million, after income taxes of $16.0 million. As part of the Companys ongoing analysis of its merchant building projects, the Company has determined that for two of its projects, located in Jacksonville, FL and Anchorage, AK, the recoverable value will not exceed their estimated cost. This is primarily due to adverse changes in local market conditions and the uncertainty of those conditions in the future. As a result, the Company has recorded an aggregate pre-tax adjustment of property carrying value on these projects for the year ended December 31, 2007, of $8.5 million, representing the excess of the carrying value of the projects over their estimated fair value. During 2006, the Company sold six recently completed merchant building projects, its partnership interest in one project and 30 out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $260.0 million. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $25.1 million, after income taxes of $12.2 million. These gains exclude approximately $1.1 million of gain relating to one project, which was deferred due to the Companys continued ownership interest. During 2007, the Company (i) disposed of six operating properties and completed partial sales of three operating properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $40.0 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $6.4 million, after income tax of approximately $1.6 million and (ii) transferred one operating property, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2007, to a joint venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling ownership interest for an aggregate price of approximately $4.5 million, which represented the net book value. Additionally, during 2007, two consolidated joint ventures in which the Company had preferred equity investments disposed of, in separate transactions, their respective properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $66.5 million. As a result of these capital transactions, the Company received approximately $22.1 million of profit participation, before minority interest of approximately $5.6 million. This profit participation has been recorded as income from other real estate investments and is reflected in Income from discontinued operating properties in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2006, the Company disposed of (i) 28 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of $270.5 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $71.7 million, net of income taxes of $2.8 million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii) transferred five operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one transferred property. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $442.8 million or $1.65 on a diluted per share basis as compared to $428.3 million or $1.70 on a diluted per share basis for the corresponding period in 2006. This change is primarily attributable to (i) an increase in revenues from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions of operating properties during 2007 and 2006, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from profit participation and gains on sale of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investments in the Companys joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional operating properties throughout 2007 and 2006, 43 (iii) earnings of $75.5 million related to the Albertsons investment monetization, partially offset by, (iv) a decrease in income resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities during the corresponding period in 2006 and (v) a decrease in gains on sale of operating properties in 2007 as compared to 2006. Comparison 2006 to 2005 2006 2005 Increase/(Decrease) % change (amounts in thousands) Revenues from rental property (1) $ 587.5 $ 501.6 $ 85.9 17.1% Rental property expenses: (2) Rent $ 11.5 $ 10.0 $ 1.5 15.0% Real estate taxes 74.6 64.1 10.5 16.4% Operating and maintenance 72.7 58.2 14.5 24.9% $ 158.8 $ 132.3 $ 26.5 20.0% Depreciation and amortization (3) $ 139.3 $ 100.5 $ 38.8 38.6% (1) Revenues from rental property increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2006 and 2005, providing incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately $72.3 million, (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 95.1% at December 31, 2006, as compared to 94.6% at December 31, 2005 and the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects providing incremental revenues of approximately $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the corresponding period in 2005, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005, resulting from the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities, tenant buyouts, and the sale of certain properties during 2005 and 2006. (2) Rental property expenses increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2006 and 2005 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. (3) Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2006 and 2005 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income decreased $8.8 million to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $27.6 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This decrease is primarily due to the recognition in 2005 of a prepayment fee of $14.0 million received by the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan with the Company, offset by accretion income of approximately $6.2 million received in 2006, resulting from an early prepayment of a mortgage receivable in June 2006, which had been acquired at a discount. Management and other fee income increased approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from the Kimsouth portfolio and growth in the Companys other co-investment programs. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to personnel-related costs including the non-cash expensing of stock options granted and the overall continued growth of the Company. Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to greater realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities and increased interest and dividend income as a result of higher cash balances and the growth in the marketable securities portfolio during 2006 as compared to 2005. Interest expense increased $44.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is due to higher interest rates and higher outstanding levels of debt during this period as compared to the same period in the preceding year. 44 Income from other real estate investments increased $20.3 million to $77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $56.8 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased investment in the Companys Preferred Equity program which contributed $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, including $12.2 million of profit participation earned from 16 capital transactions, as compared to $32.8 million for the corresponding period in 2005, including $12.6 million of profit participation earned from six capital transactions and (ii) pre-tax profits of $7.9 million from the transfer of two properties from Kimsouth to a joint venture in which the Company has an 18% non-controlling interest. These profits exclude amounts that have been deferred as a result of the Companys continued ownership interest. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $28.1 million to $105.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $77.5 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) increase in equity in income from the KROP joint venture primarily resulting from profit participation of approximately $22.2 million and gains from the sale of nine operating properties, one land parcel and one out-parcel during 2006 of which the Companys share of gains was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and (ii) the Companys growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties by the ventures throughout 2006 and 2005. During 2006, the Company sold six recently completed merchant building projects, its partnership interest in one project and 30 out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $260.0 million. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $25.1 million, after income taxes of $12.2 million. These gains exclude approximately $1.1 million of gain relating to one project, which was deferred due to the Companys continued ownership interest. During 2005, the Company sold, in separate transactions, 41 out-parcels and six recently completed merchant building projects for approximately $264.1 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $22.8 million, after income taxes of approximately $10.8 million. During 2006, the Company disposed of (i) 28 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of $270.5 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $71.7 million, net of income taxes of $2.8 million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii) transferred five operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one transferred property. During 2005, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million and (iii) transferred 52 operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of approximately $183.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $428.3 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $363.6 million. On a diluted per share basis, net income improved $0.18 to $1.70 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $1.52 for the corresponding period in 2005. These increases are attributable to (i) an increase in revenues from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions in 2006 and 2005, (ii) increased income from other real estate investments primarily due to increased investments in the Companys Preferred Equity program, (iii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from profit participation and gains on sale of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investment in the Companys joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional operating properties throughout 2006 and 2005, (iv) increased gains on sales of operating properties in 2006 and (v) increased income contributed from the marketable securities portfolio in 2006 as compared to 2005, partially offset by, (vi) an increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings during 2006. 45 Tenant Concentrations The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2007, the Companys five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.2%, 2.8%, 2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys capital resources include access to liquidity in the capital markets, mortgage and construction loan financing and immediate access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of approximately $1.8 billion. The Companys cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net cash flow provided by operating activities $ 666.0 $ 455.6 $ 410.8 Net cash flow used for investing activities $ (1,507.6) $ (246.2) $ (716.0) Net cash flow provided by financing activities $ 584.1 $ 59.4 $ 343.3 Operating Activities Cash flows provided from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $666.0 million, as compared to approximately $455.6 million for the comparable period in 2006. The increase of approximately $210.4 million is primarily attributable to increased cash flows due to (i) the acquisition of properties during 2007 and 2006, (ii) an increase in revenues from rental properties due to an overall occupancy increase from the consolidated shopping center portfolio, growth in rental rates from lease renewals and the completion of certain re-development and development projects and (iii) an increase in distributions from joint ventures primarily received from the Companys investment in KROP resulting from the distribution of profit participation proceeds and distributions from the Albertson's investment. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily attributable to (i) cash flow from the diverse portfolio of rental properties, (ii) the acquisition of operating properties during 2007 and 2006, (iii) new leasing, expansion and re-tenanting of core portfolio properties and (iv) growth in the Companys joint venture and Preferred Equity programs. Investing Activities Cash flows used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $1.5 billion, as compared to approximately $246.2 million for the comparable period in 2006. This increase in cash utilization of $1.3 billion resulted primarily from an increase in acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate and real estate under development and a decrease in proceeds received from transferred operating/development properties, partially offset by reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures received in 2007 as compared to 2006. Acquisitions and Redevelopments During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company expended approximately $1.0 billion towards acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) 46 The Company has an ongoing program to reformat and re-tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company expended approximately $70.1 million in connection with these major redevelopments and re-tenanting projects. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these and other redevelopment projects during 2008 will be approximately $90.0 million to $110.0 million. The funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from operating activities and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit. Investments and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company expended approximately $413.2 million for investments and advances to real estate joint ventures and received approximately $293.5 million from reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures. (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) Ground-up Development The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects which consist of (i) merchant building through the Companys wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which develop neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Mexico for long-term investment (see Recent Developments - International Real Estate Investments and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). The ground-up development projects generally have significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress a total of 60 ground-up development projects including 27 merchant building projects, nine U.S. ground-up development projects, and 24 ground-up development projects located throughout Mexico. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company expended approximately $640.9 million in connection with the purchase of land and construction costs related to these projects and those sold during 2007. The Company anticipates its capital commitment during 2008 toward these and other development projects will be approximately $200.0 million to $250.0 million. The proceeds from the sales of completed ground-up development projects, proceeds from construction loans and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these anticipated capital requirements. Dispositions and Transfers During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $359.2 million relating to the sale of various operating properties and ground-up development projects and approximately $69.9 million from the transfer of operating properties to various joint ventures. (See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) Financing Activities Cash flows provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $584.1 million, as compared to approximately $59.4 million for the comparable period in 2006. This increase of approximately $524.7 million resulted primarily from (i) an increase in borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities in 2007 due to increased investment activity during 2007, (ii) an increase in proceeds from mortgage/construction loan financing and (iii) a decrease in the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facilities in 2007 as compared to 2006, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid. It is managements intention that the Company continually has access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys level of debt to total market capitalization was 30%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment-grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time-to-time, seek to obtain funds through additional common and preferred equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure. 47 Since the completion of the Companys IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $5.7 billion. Proceeds from public capital market activities have been used for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground-up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap corporations, most of which are U.S. corporations. During October 2007, the Company established a new $1.5 billion unsecured U.S. revolving credit facility (the "U.S. Credit Facility") with a group of banks, which is scheduled to expire in October 2011. This credit facility, which replaced the Companys $850.0 million unsecured U.S. revolving facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2008, has made available funds to finance general corporate purposes, including (i) property acquisitions, (ii) investments in the Companys institutional management programs, (iii) development and redevelopment costs and (iv) any short-term working capital requirements. Interest on borrowings under the U.S. Credit Facility accrues at LIBOR plus 0.375% and fluctuates in accordance with changes in the Companys senior debt ratings. As part of this U.S. Credit Facility, the Company has a competitive bid option whereby the Company may auction up to $750.0 million of its requested borrowings to the bank group. This competitive bid option provides the Company the opportunity to obtain pricing below the currently stated spread. A facility fee of 0.125% per annum is payable quarterly in arrears. As part of the U.S. Credit Facility, the Company has a $200.0 million sub-limit which provides it the opportunity to borrow in alternative currencies such as Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen or Euros. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. Credit Facility, the Company, among other things, is subject to covenants requiring the maintenance of (i) maximum leverage ratios on both secured and unsecured debt and (ii) minimum interest and fixed coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $259.0 million outstanding under this credit facility, of which approximately $9.0 million (approximately 4.5 million Pounds Sterling) was outstanding under the alternative currency sub-limit. The Company also has a three-year CAD $250.0 million unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. This facility bore interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.45%, and was scheduled to expire in March 2008. During October 2007, the facility was amended to modify the covenant package to conform to the Companys U.S. Credit Facility. The facility was further amended in January 2008, to extend the maturity date to 2011, with an additional one-year extension option, at a reduced rate of CDOR plus 0.375%, subject to change in accordance with the Companys senior debt ratings. Proceeds from this facility are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of Canadian denominated investments. As of December 31, 2007, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility. Additionally, the Company has a three-year MXP 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility bears interest at the TIIE Rate, as defined therein, plus 1.00%, subject to change in accordance with the Companys senior debt ratings, and is scheduled to mature in May 2008 with an additional one-year extension option. Proceeds from this facility are used to fund peso denominated investments. As of December 31, 2007, there was MXP 250.0 million (approximately USD $22.9 million) outstanding under this credit facility. The Company is currently negotiating a five-year fixed rate MXP 1.0 billion term loan. Proceeds from this loan will be used to pay the outstanding balance on the MXP 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and for funding Mexican denominated investments. During August 2007, the Company obtained a $200.0 million unsecured term loan that bore interest at LIBOR plus 0.325%. The term loan was scheduled to mature on December 14, 2007. The Company utilized these proceeds to partially repay the outstanding balance on the Companys U.S. Credit Facility. The term loan was fully repaid in October 2007. The Company has a Medium Term Notes ("MTN") program pursuant to which it may, from time-to-time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Companys debt maturities. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) 48 During April 2007, the Company issued $300.0 million of ten-year Senior Unsecured Notes at an interest rate of 5.70% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes were sold at 99.984% of par value. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $297.8 million, after related transaction costs of approximately $2.2 million. The proceeds from this issuance were primarily used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the Companys U.S. Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. These notes were issued in conjunction with a fourth supplemental indenture, which removed the financial covenant requirements for this issuance and future offerings under the indenture as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company repaid the following senior unsecured notes: (i) its $30.0 million 7.46% fixed rate notes, which matured on May 20, 2007, (ii) its $55.0 million 5.75% fixed rate notes, which matured on June 29, 2007, (iii) its $20.0 million 6.96% fixed rate notes which matured on July 16, 2007, (iv) its $50.0 million 7.86% fixed rate notes, which matured on November 1, 2007, (v) its $50.0 million 7.90% fixed rate notes, which matured on December 7, 2007 and (vi) its $10.0 million 6.70% fixed rate notes, which matured on December 14, 2007. Additionally, the Company repaid its $35.0 million 4.96% fixed rate Senior Unsecured Notes, which matured on November 30, 2007. In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time-to-time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of its ground-up development projects. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had over 390 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. During 2007, the Company (i) obtained an aggregate of approximately $285.8 million of non-recourse mortgage debt on 12 operating properties, (ii) assumed approximately $83.7 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt relating to the acquisition of eight operating properties, including approximately $2.5 million of fair value debt adjustments and (iii) paid off approximately $81.6 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt that encumbered 11 operating properties. During 2007, the Company obtained individual construction loans on five merchant building projects and assumed one loan in connection with the acquisition of a merchant building project. Additionally, the Company repaid construction loans on three merchant building projects. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had a total of 15 construction loans with commitments of up to $360.3 million of which approximately $245.9 million has been funded. These loans had scheduled maturities ranging from one month to 33 months (excluding any extension options which may be available to the Company) and bear interest at rates ranging from 6.78% to 7.48% at December 31, 2007. During May 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR, which is effective for a term of three-years, for the unlimited future offerings, from time-to-time, of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. During October 2007, the Company issued 18,400,000 Depositary Shares (the "Class G Depositary Shares"), after the exercise of an over-allotment option, each representing a one-hundredth fractional interest in a share of the Companys 7.75% Class G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Class G Preferred Stock"). Dividends on the Class G Depositary Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears at the rate of 7.75% per annum based on the $25.00 per share initial offering price, or $1.9375 per annum. The Class G Depositary Shares are redeemable, in whole or part, for cash on or after October 10, 2012, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price of $25.00 per depositary share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. The Class G Depositary Shares are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Company. Net proceeds from the sale of the Class G Depositary Shares, totaling approximately $444.5 million (after related transaction costs of $15.5 million) were used for general corporate purposes, including funding property acquisitions, investments in the Companys institutional management programs and other investment activities. The Company also used a portion of the proceeds to partially repay amounts outstanding under its U.S. Credit Facility. During 2007, the Company received approximately $38.1 million through employee stock option exercises and the dividend reinvestment program. In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and 49 from other investments. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $384.5 million in 2007, compared to $332.6 million in 2006 and $293.3 million in 2005. Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. The Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share payable to shareholders of record on January 2, 2008, which was paid on January 15, 2008. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 28 years. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 5.5 years. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has 79 shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has 19 non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Companys debt maturities and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2007 (in millions): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt, including interest (1)(2) $742.9 $523.6 $500.7 $817.0 $405.8 $2,448.4 $5,438.4 Operating Leases Ground Leases $ 11.4 $ 10.9 $ 9.0 $ 6.7 $ 6.0 $115.6 $ 159.6 Retail Store Leases $ 3.9 $ 3.7 $ 3.6 $ 3.1 $ 2.0 $ 1.3 $ 17.6 (1) maturities utilized do not reflect extension options, which range from six months to two years. (2) for loans which have interest at floating rates, future interest expense was calculated using the rate as of December 31, 2007. The Company has $100.0 million of medium term notes, $25.3 million of senior unsecured notes, $84.4 million of mortgage debt and $260.9 million of construction loans scheduled to mature in 2008. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities, new debt issuances and the sale of completed ground-up development projects. The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering certain of the Companys ground-up development projects and guaranty of payment related to the Companys insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $30.7 million. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The Company does not have any material unrecognized tax benefits, therefore the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. During June 2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest, and acquired all of the common stock of InTown Suites Management, Inc. This investment was funded with approximately $186.0 million of new 50 cross-collateralized non-recourse mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate of 5.59%, encumbering 35 properties, a $153.0 million three-year unsecured credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.325% and is guaranteed by the Company and the assumption of $278.6 million cross-collateralized non-recourse mortgage debt with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.19% to 5.89%, encumbering 86 properties. The joint venture partner has pledged its equity interest for any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to pay. The outstanding balance on the three-year unsecured credit facility was $149.0 million as of December 31, 2007. The joint venture obtained an interest rate swap at 5.37% on $128.0 million of this debt. The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and as such adjustments are recorded in Other comprehensive income. During 2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest, to acquire a property in Houston, Texas. This investment was funded with a $24.5 million one-year unsecured credit facility with an additional one-year extension option, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.375% and is guaranteed by the Company. The outstanding balance on this credit facility as of December 31, 2007 was $24.5 million. During April 2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a 50% non-controlling ownership interest to acquire a property in Visalia, CA. Subsequent to this acquisition the joint venture obtained a three-year $6.0 million three-year promissory note which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75%, and has an extension option of two-years. This loan is jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this loan was $6.0 million. The KimPru joint ventures, entities in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling interest, with Prudential Real Estate Investors ("PREI") through three separate accounts managed by PREI obtained a $1.2 billion two-year credit facility provided by a consortium of banks and guaranteed by the Company. PREI guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. As of December 31, 2007, there was $702.5 million outstanding under this credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.45% and is scheduled to mature in October 2008. During 2006, an entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment, located in Montreal, Canada, obtained a non-recourse construction loan, which is collateralized by the respective land and project improvements. Additionally, the Company has provided a guaranty to the lender and the developer partner has provided an indemnity to the Company for 25% of all debt. As of December 31, 2007, there was CAD $72.6 million (approximately USD $74.0 million) outstanding on this construction loan. In connection with the construction of its development projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require performance and surety bonds be posted to guarantee that the Companys obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately $90.4 million bonds outstanding. Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non-controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $7.1 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $5.5 million (approximately USD $5.6 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2007, relating to various development projects. During 2005, an entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment obtained a CAD $22.5 million (approximately USD $22.9 million) credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center property located in Kamloops, B.C. This facility bears interest at Royal Bank Prime Rate ("RBP") plus 0.5% per annum and is scheduled to mature in March 2008. The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million (approximately USD $7.6 million) on this facility. As of December 31, 2007, there was CAD $21.1 million (approximately USD $21.5 million) outstanding on this facility. During 2005, PL Retail, a joint venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling interest, entered into a $39.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.45% and was scheduled to mature in February 2008. During 2008, the loan was extended to February 2009. This facility is guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. As of December 31, 2007, there was $24.6 million outstanding under this facility. 51 Additionally, during 2005, the Company acquired three operating properties and one land parcel, through joint ventures, in which the Company holds 50% non-controlling interests. Subsequent to these acquisitions, the joint ventures obtained four individual one-year loans aggregating $20.4 million with interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 0.55%. During 2007, one of these properties was sold for a sales price of approximately $10.5 million, including the pay down of $5.0 million of debt. During 2007, two of these term loans were extended until May 2008 and one was extended until October 2008. As of December 31, 2007, there was an aggregate of $15.4 million outstanding on these loans. These loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Merchant Building Joint Ventures At December 31, 2007, the Company has two merchant building projects through unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has 50% non-controlling interests. One project is financed with a $113.0 million ten-year permanent note, which bears interest at a rate of 5.55% per annum. The other project is financed with a term loan, which is 50% guaranteed by the Company, with a commitment of up to $28.0 million of which $28.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007. This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.55%, or 6.78% at December 31, 2007, and is scheduled to mature in September 2008. Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans. Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). These investments include the following joint ventures: Venture KimcoOwnershipInterest NumberofProperties Total GLA(in thousands) Non-RecourseMortgagePayable(in millions) RecourseNotesPayable(in millions) Number ofEncumberedProperties AverageInterestRate WeightedAverageTerm(months) KimPru (c) 15.00% 127 19,837 $2,085.5 $702.5(b) 92 5.66% 70.1 KIR (d) 45.00% 63 13,117 $1,018.7 $ - 61 6.96% 41.4 PL Retail (e) 15.00% 22 5,578 $ 658.2 $ 24.6(b) 22 6.17% 26.0 KUBS (f) 17.89%(a) 43 6,166 $ 770.2 $ - 43 5.70% 89.2 RioCan Venture (g) 50.00% 35 8,199 $ 763.9 $ - 35 6.12% 67.0 (a) Ownership % is a blended rate.

(f) Represents the Companys joint ventures with UBS Wealth Management North American Property Fund Limited. (g) Represents the Companys joint venture with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust. The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. As of December 31, 2007, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $2.9 billion. The Companys share of these non-recourse mortgages was approximately $707.7 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) 52 Other Real Estate Investments The Company maintains a Preferred Equity program, which provides capital to developers and owners of real estate properties. The Company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys net investment under the Preferred Equity Program was approximately $484.1 million relating to 258 properties. As of December 31, 2007, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $1.7 billion. Due to the Companys preferred position in these investments, the Companys share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Companys maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested capital. Additionally, during July 2007, the Company invested approximately $81.7 million of preferred equity capital in a portfolio comprised of 403 net leased properties which are divided into 30 master leased pools with each pool leased to individual corporate operators. These properties consist of a diverse array of free-standing restaurants, fast food restaurants, convenience and auto parts stores. As of December 31, 2007 these properties were encumbered by third party loans aggregating approximately $433.0 million with interest rates ranging from 5.08% to 10.47% with a weighted average interest rate of 9.3% and maturities ranging from 1.4 years to 15.2 years. During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Companys cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income and deferred taxes relating to the investment. As of December 31, 2007, 18 of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $32.1 million. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining 12 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of approximately $48.8 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. Effects of Inflation Many of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("SFAS No. 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. During February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that will (i) partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (ii) remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 53 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In June 2007, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 07-1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies (SOP 07-1). SOP 07-1 sets forth more stringent criteria for qualifying as an investment company than does the predecessor Audit Guide. In addition, SOP 07-1 establishes new criteria for a parent company or equity method investor to retain investment company accounting in their consolidated financial statements. Investment companies record all their investments at fair value with changes in value reflected in earnings. SOP 07-1 was to be effective for the Companys 2008 fiscal year, however, in October 2007 the FASB agreed to propose an indefinite delay, and, in February 2008, the FASB issued a final Staff Position to indefinitely delay the effective date of SOP 07-1. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141(R)"). The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, this Statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) would have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51("SFAS No. 160"). A noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require: (i) the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity, (ii) the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, (iii) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently and requires that they be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions, (iv) when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value, the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment and (v) entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 would have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Item 7A.

The foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated through the use of local currency denominated debt. The Company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk. Item 8.

Item 9B. Other Information Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. On February 27, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors amended and restated the Company's bylaws, effective upon adoption. The full text of the Company's amended and restated bylaws is set forth in Exhibit 3.2 to this 10-K and is incorporated into this Item 9B by reference. The following summarizes these amendments. Voting Requirements for Election of Directors · Previously, the bylaws provided that a plurality vote was sufficient to elect directors. As amended, Article II, Section 5 of the bylaws provides that, except in an election in which the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected, each director must be elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at any meeting that includes the election of directors and at which a quorum is present. · For purposes of the election of directors, a majority of the votes cast means the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against such nominee. Votes cast do not include abstentions and any broker non-votes. · In an election in which the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected, directors will continue to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Director Resignations · If an incumbent director fails to receive the requisite vote in an election, the bylaws require (1) the director to offer to resign from the Board, (2) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board to make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the Board should accept the resignation and (3) the Board to consider the recommendation of the Committee and to publicly disclose its decision regarding the resignation, and the reasons for its decision within 90 days after the date on which the results of the election were certified. 56 · The Committee, in making its recommendation, and the Board, in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers to be relevant. The director whose resignation is being considered may not participate in the recommendation of the Committee or the decision of the Board, except in the event that no nominee for director receives the vote required in the bylaws for election. · If an incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, the director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies, or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement or removal. · If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board, or if a non-incumbent nominee for director is not elected, the Board may fill any resulting vacancy in accordance with the bylaws. Advance Notice Provisions · Article II, Section 12 was added to include advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations for director and stockholder business proposals at annual and special stockholder meetings. The advance notice period for annual stockholder meetings synchronizes the advance notice timing under the bylaws with the federal proxy rules. For annual stockholders meetings, the bylaws generally provide that such advance notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Company not earlier than the 150th day nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. · For special meetings of stockholders, stockholders must notify the Secretary of the Company of director nominations (if the Board has determined that directors will be elected at such special meeting) and other stockholder proposals not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting. · Additionally, the amended bylaws require certain information to be provided by the stockholder making a nomination or proposal, including information about the nominee or proposal, persons controlling or acting in concert with such stockholder and information about any hedging activities engaged in by them. The amended bylaws also establish procedures for the verification of information provided by the stockholder making the proposal. Other Bylaw Amendments · Article II, Section 3 was added to establish procedures and requirements for stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders, including, among other things, addressing issues relating to (1) who may call a special meeting of stockholders, (2) the fixing of a record date for determining stockholders entitled to request a special meeting and stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and (3) setting the time, date and place of special stockholders meetings. · Article II, Section 4 was amended to provide that (1) the chairman of a meeting of stockholders will have the power to adjourn the meeting and (2) a stockholders meeting may be adjourned without further notice (other than a statement at the meeting) to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date. · Article II, Section 7 was amended to (1) provide that a minor irregularity in providing notice of a stockholders meeting will not affect the validity of the meeting, (2) clarify that any business of the Company may be transacted at an annual meeting without being specifically designated in the notice while business transacted at a special meeting must be disclosed in the notice of the special meeting and (3) provide that the Company may postpone or cancel a meeting by making a public announcement. · Article II, Section 8 was amended to provide a more comprehensive list of the powers of the chairman in the conduct of the meeting, including, among other things, complying with state and local laws concerning safety and security. 57 · Article II, Section 10 was added to (1) clarify the procedures for voting stock registered in the name of the Company and other business entities and (2) provide for a procedure by which a stockholder may certify that shares of stock are held for the account of another person. · Article II, Section 11 was added to provide for the appointment and powers of inspectors at stockholders meetings. · Article III, Section 4 was amended to provide that, when a vacancy on the Board of Directors results from an increase in the number of directors, a majority of the entire Board may fill the vacancy. Any other vacancy on the Board may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum. · Article III, Section 5 was added to provide for the holding of regular meetings of the Board without notice other than a resolution setting the time and place for the meetings. · Article III, Section 9 was amended to clarify that, if enough directors have withdrawn from a meeting to leave less than a quorum but the meeting is not adjourned, the action of the majority of the number of directors necessary to constitute a quorum is the action of the Board, unless a greater proportion is required by applicable law, the charter or another provision of the bylaws. · Article III, Section 10 was added to more fully describe the procedures for choosing the chairman and secretary of Board meetings. · Article III, Section 11 was amended to permit unanimous Board consent via electronic transmission. · Article III, Section 13 was amended to provide compensation to the directors who are not officers of the Corporation based on an annual sum for their service on the Board of Directors and its committees. · Article III, Section 14 was added to clarify that directors and officers may rely on information prepared or presented by others whom the director or officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented. · Article III, Section 15 was added to clarify the power of the Board and stockholders to ratify prior actions or inactions by the Company, including matters questioned in litigation. · Article III, Section 16 was added to provide for procedural flexibility in the event of an emergency. · Article IV, Sections 1-2 were added to (1) authorize the Board to delegate any of its powers to a committee, except as prohibited by law and (2) clarify Board committee meeting procedures with respect to notice, quorum and voting. · Article V was amended to clarify that reimbursement of expenses may be in advance of final disposition of a proceeding and that a director or officer who is threatened to be made a party to a proceeding is entitled to indemnification and advance of expenses. Article V was also amended to clarify that rights to indemnification and expense advance provided in the bylaws are not exclusive of other indemnification rights or expense advance. · Article VII, Section 1 was amended to expand the list of permitted officers. · Article VII, Section 5 was added to provide that any officer or agent of the Company may be removed, with or without cause, by the Board if in its judgment the best interests of the Company would be served thereby, but such removal will be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. Article VII, Section 5 was also amended to clarify procedures for the resignation of an officer. · Article VII, Section 7 was amended to clarify that, in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer, the President will be the CEO. · Article VII, Section 11 was amended to delete legacy provisions concerning the giving of bonds by the Treasurer. · Article VIII, Sections 1-3 were added to (1) provide that a stockholder is not entitled to a stock certificate and (2) make updates in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange's recently adopted Direct Registration System eligibility requirements. · In addition to the bylaw amendments summarized above, the Board also added and amended other sections of the Company's bylaws. 58 PART III Item 10.

Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 123 III. Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation 124 IV. Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 132 67 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kimco Realty Corporation: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kimco Realty Corporation and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York February 27, 2008 68 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in thousands, except share information) December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 Assets: Real Estate Rental property Land $ 1,262,879 $ 978,819 Building and improvements 4,917,750 3,984,518 6,180,629 4,963,337 Less, accumulated depreciation and amortization 977,444 806,670 5,203,185 4,156,667 Real estate under development 1,144,406 1,037,982 Real estate, net 6,347,591 5,194,649 Investments and advances in real estate joint ventures 1,246,917 1,067,918 Other real estate investments 615,016 451,731 Mortgages and other financing receivables 153,847 162,669 Cash and cash equivalents 87,499 345,065 Marketable securities 212,988 202,659 Accounts and notes receivable 88,017 83,418 Deferred charges and prepaid expenses 121,690 95,163 Other assets 224,251 266,008 Total assets $ 9,097,816 $ 7,869,280 Liabilities & Stockholders' Equity: Notes payable $ 3,131,765 $ 2,748,345 Mortgages payable 838,736 567,917 Construction loans payable 245,914 270,981 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 161,526 163,668 Dividends payable 112,052 93,222 Other liabilities 265,090 232,946 Total liabilities 4,755,083 4,077,079 Minority interests 448,159 425,242 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity: Preferred Stock , $1.00 par value, authorized 3,232,000 and 3,600,000 shares, respectively Class F Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value, authorized 700,000 shares Issued and outstanding 700,000 shares 700 700 Aggregate liquidation preference $175,000 Class G Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value, authorized 184,000 shares Issued and outstanding 184,000 shares 184 - Aggregate liquidation preference $460,000 Common stock, $.01 par value, authorized 750,000,000 and 300,000,000 shares, respectively Issued 253,350,144 and 251,416,749, shares;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Business Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Company" or "Kimco"), its subsidiaries, affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the operation of neighborhood and community shopping centers which are anchored generally by discount department stores, supermarkets or drugstores. The Company also provides property management services for shopping centers owned by affiliated entities, various real estate joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, in connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building through its wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries including Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI"), which are primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2007, the Company's single largest neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for only 1.7% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues and only 0.8% of the Companys total shopping center gross leasable area ("GLA"). At December 31, 2007, the Companys five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.2%, 2.8%, 2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. The principal business of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is the ownership, development, management and operation of retail shopping centers, including complementary services that capitalize on the Companys established retail real estate expertise. The Company does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Principles of Consolidation and Estimates The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46(R)") or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 74 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, depreciable lives, revenue recognition, the collectability of trade accounts receivable, and the realizability of deferred tax assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Minority Interests Minority interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those entities it consolidates as a result of having a controlling interest or determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of FIN 46(R). Minority interests also include partnership units issued from consolidated subsidiaries of the Company in connection with certain property acquisitions. These units have a stated redemption value or a redemption amount based upon the Adjusted Current Trading Price, as defined, of the Companys common stock ("Common Stock") and provide the unit holders various rates of return during the holding period. The unit holders generally have the right to redeem their units for cash at any time after one year from issuance. The Company typically has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or Common Stock for the issuance of convertible units. The Company evaluates the terms of the partnership units issued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, and EITF D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, to determine if the units are mandatorily redeemable and as such accounts for them accordingly. Real Estate Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. If there is an event or a change in circumstances that indicates that the basis of a property (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable, then management will assess any impairment in value by making a comparison of (i) the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its estimated holding period, and (ii) the net carrying amount of the property. If the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships), assumed debt and redeemable units issued in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141"), at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the initial purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. As final information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. The allocations are finalized within twelve months of the acquisition date. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property "as-if-vacant". The fair value reflects the depreciated replacement cost of the permanent assets, with no trade fixtures included. 75 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued In allocating the purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the value of above-market and below-market leases is estimated based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases and managements estimate of the market lease rates and other lease provisions (i.e., expense recapture, base rental changes, etc.) measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. The capitalized above-market or below-market intangible is amortized to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases. Mortgage debt premiums are amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instrument. Unit discounts and premiums are amortized into Minority interest in income, net over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the units. In determining the value of in-place leases, management considers current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods and costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related costs based on current market demand. In estimating the value of tenant relationships, management considers the nature and extent of the existing tenant relationship, the expectation of lease renewals, growth prospects, and tenant credit quality, among other factors. The value assigned to in-place leases and tenant relationships is amortized over the estimated remaining term of the leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration, all unamortized costs relating to that lease would be written off. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings and building improvements 15 to 50 years Fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements Terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter (including certain identified intangible assets) Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. Real Estate Under Development Real estate under development represents both the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments. These properties are carried at cost. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries, and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of assets held for resale or the current and projected undiscounted cash flows of these assets to be held as long-term investments is less than the net carrying value, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable, based upon an allocation of the investments net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. 76 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The Companys joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Companys exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment; and due to the lenders exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. The Companys exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments. On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investments value is impaired only if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Other Real Estate Investments Other real estate investments primarily consist of preferred equity investments for which the Company provides capital to developers and owners of real estate. The Company typically accounts for its preferred equity investments on the equity method of accounting, whereby earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and based upon an allocation of the investments net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. Mortgages and Other Financing Receivables Mortgages and other financing receivables consist of loans acquired and loans originated by the Company. Loan receivables are recorded at stated principal amounts net of any discount or premium or deferred loan origination costs or fees. The related discounts or premiums on mortgages and other loans purchased are amortized or accreted over the life of the related loan receivable. The Company defers certain loan origination and commitment fees, net of certain origination costs and amortizes them as an adjustment of the loans yield over the term of the related loan. The Company evaluates the collectability of both interest and principal on each loan to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of loss is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rate or to the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateralized. Interest income on performing loans is accrued as earned. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents (demand deposits in banks, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less) includes tenants' security deposits, escrowed funds and other restricted deposits approximating $0.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Cash and cash equivalent balances may, at a limited number of banks and financial institutions, exceed insurable amounts. The Company believes it mitigates risk by investing in or through major financial institutions. Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuers. Marketable Securities The Company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. 77 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued All debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys marketable securities may be impaired. A marketable security is impaired only if managements estimate of fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security. Deferred Leasing and Financing Costs Costs incurred in obtaining tenant leases and long-term financing, included in deferred charges and prepaid expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are amortized over the terms of the related leases or debt agreements, as applicable. Such capitalized costs include salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved in successful leasing efforts. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is achieved. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Management and other fee income consists of property management fees, leasing fees, property acquisition and disposition fees, development fees and asset management fees. These fees arise from contractual agreements with third parties or with entities in which the Company has a partial non-controlling interest. Management and other fee income, including acquisition and disposition fees, are recognized as earned under the respective agreements. Management and other fee income related to partially owned entities are recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated interest. Gains and losses from the sale of depreciated operating property and ground-up development projects are generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate ("SFAS No. 66"), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of sale and subsequent involvement by the Company with the properties are met. Gains and losses on transfers of operating properties result from the sale of a partial interest in properties to unconsolidated joint ventures and are recognized using the partial sale provisions of SFAS No. 66. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Income Taxes The Company has made an election to qualify, and believes it is operating so as to qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined under Section 856 through 860 of the Code. 78 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued In connection with the RMA, which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in certain activities which it was previously precluded from in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code. As such, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these activities. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions Assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign operations are translated using year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in OCI, as a separate component of the Companys stockholders equity. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The effect of the transactions gain or loss is included in the caption Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Derivative/Financial Instruments The Company measures its derivative instruments at fair value and records them in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability, depending on the Companys rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract. In addition, the fair value adjustments will be recorded in either stockholders equity or earnings in the current period based on the designation of the derivative. The effective portions of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in OCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency hedges that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are included in the cumulative translation component of OCI to the extent they are economically effective and are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged investments are sold or otherwise disposed of. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of hedges are recorded in earnings for the current period. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market fluctuations on equity securities. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Additionally, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions. The principal financial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and warrant contracts. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow, fair value or foreign currency hedges (see Note 16). Earnings Per Share On July 21, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split (the "Stock Split") of the Companys common stock which was effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on August 23, 2005, to stockholders of record on August 8, 2005. All share and per share data included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect this Stock Split. 79 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The following table sets forth the reconciliation of earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (amounts presented in thousands, except per share data): 2007 2006 2005 Computation of Basic Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations beforeextraordinary gain $ 359,226 $ 342,849 $ 322,063 Gain on transfer of operating properties, net - 1,394 2,151 Gain on sale of operating properties, net of tax 2,708 1,066 682 Preferred stock dividends (19,659) (11,638) (11,638) Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain applicable to common shares 342,275 333,671 313,258 Income from discontinued operations 30,631 82,950 38,732 Extraordinary gain 50,265 - - Net income applicable to common shares $ 423,171 $ 416,621 $ 351,990 Weighted average common shares outstanding 252,129 239,552 226,641 Basic Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations beforeextraordinary gain $ 1.36 $ 1.39 $ 1.38 Income from discontinued operations 0.12 0.35 0.17 Extraordinary gain 0.20 - - Net income $ 1.68 $ 1.74 $ 1.55 Computation of Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations beforeextraordinary gain for diluted earnings per share (a) $ 342,275 $ 333,671 $ 313,258 Income from discontinued operations 30,631 82,950 38,732 Extraordinary gain 50,265 - - Net income for diluted earnings per share $ 423,171 $ 416,621 $ 351,990 Weighted average common shares outstanding  Basic 252,129 239,552 226,641 Effect of dilutive securities (a): Stock options/deferred stock awards 4,929 5,063 4,227 Shares for diluted earnings per common share 257,058 244,615 230,868 Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain $ 1.33 $ 1.36 $ 1.36 Income from discontinued operations 0.12 0.34 0.16 Extraordinary gain 0.20 - - Net income $ 1.65 $ 1.70 $ 1.52 (a) The effect of the assumed conversion of certain convertible units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, there were approximately 3,017,400, 71,250, and 2,195,400 stock options that were anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 80 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Stock Compensation The Company maintains an equity participation plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which a maximum of 42,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued for qualified and non-qualified options and restricted stock grants. Options granted under the Plan generally vest ratably over a three year term for options granted prior to August 1, 2005 or five year term for options granted after August 1, 2005, expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors at its sole discretion. Restricted stock grants generally vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the grant. In addition, the Plan provides for the granting of certain options to each of the Companys non-employee directors (the "Independent Directors") and permits such Independent Directors to elect to receive deferred stock awards in lieu of directors fees. Prior to January 1, 2003, the Company accounted for the Plan under the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation (an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25). Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 ("SFAS No. 148"), which applies the recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS No. 123") to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. During December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which is a revision of Statement 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Opinion 25. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro-forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2005. The Company began expensing stock based employee compensation with its adoption of the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148, effective January 1, 2003, as a result, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The non-cash expense related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123. There was no difference in amounts for the years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding stock awards in 2005 (amounts presented in thousands, except per share data): 2005 Net income, as reported $ 363,628 Add: Stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income 4,608 Deduct: Total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards (5,206) Pro Forma Net Income  Basic $ 363,030 Earnings Per Share Basic  as reported $ 1.55 Basic  pro forma $ 1.55 81 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Net income for diluted earnings per share $ 351,990 Add: Stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income 4,608 Deduct: Total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards (5,206) Pro Forma Net Income  Diluted $ 351,392 Earnings Per Share Diluted  as reported $ 1.52 Diluted  pro forma $ 1.52 The pro forma adjustments to net income and net income per diluted common share assume fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. The more significant assumptions underlying the determination of such fair values for options granted during the year ended December 2005 were as follows: 2005 Weighted average fair value of options granted $3.21 Weighted average risk-free interest rates 4.03% Weighted average expected option lives 4.80 Weighted average expected volatility 18.01% Weighted average expected dividend yield 5.30% New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("SFAS No. 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. During February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that will (i) partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (ii) remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In June 2007, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 07-1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies ("SOP 07-1"). SOP 07-1 sets forth more stringent criteria for qualifying as an investment company than does the predecessor Audit Guide. In addition, SOP 07-1 establishes new criteria for a parent company or equity method investor to retain investment company accounting in their consolidated financial statements. Investment companies record all their investments at fair value with changes in value reflected in earnings. SOP 07-1 was to be effective for the Companys 2008 fiscal year, however, in October 2007 the FASB agreed to propose an indefinite delay and in February 2008, the FASB issued a final Staff Position to indefinitely delay the effective date of SOP 07-1. 82 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141(R)"). The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, representation, faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, this Statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No 141(R) would have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non-Controlling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements in Amendment of ARB No. 51 ("SFAS No. 160"). A non-controlling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require: (i) the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity, (ii) the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, (iii) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently and requires that they be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions, (iv) when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value, the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any non-controlling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment, and (v) entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identity and distinguish between the interest of the parent and the interest of the non-controlling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 would have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Reclassification Certain reclassification of prior years amounts have been made to conform with the current year presentation. 2. Real Estate: The Companys components of Rental property consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2007 2006 Land $ 1,262,879 $ 978,819 Buildings and improvements Buildings 3,559,464 2,980,369 Building improvements 566,720 301,584 Tenant improvements 549,490 528,479 Fixtures and leasehold improvements 33,932 22,216 Other rental property (1) 208,144 151,870 6,180,629 4,963,337 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (977,444) (806,670) Total $ 5,203,185 $ 4,156,667 83 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued (1) At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Other rental property consisted of intangible assets including $130,598 and $88,328 respectively, of in-place leases, $21,555 and $15,705 respectively, of tenant relationships, and $55,991 and $47,837 respectively, of above-market leases. In addition, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had intangible liabilities relating to below-market leases from property acquisitions of approximately $182.3 million and $120.6 million, respectively. These amounts are included in the caption Other liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. 3. Property Acquisitions, Developments and Other Investments: Operating property acquisitions, ground-up development costs and other investments have been funded principally through the application of proceeds from the Company's public equity and unsecured debt issuances, proceeds from mortgage and construction financings, availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit and issuance of various partnership units. Operating Properties Acquisition of Operating Properties - During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company acquired, in separate transactions, 61 operating properties, comprising an aggregate 4.4 million square feet of GLA, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion including the assumption of approximately $114.3 million of non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering nine of the properties.
