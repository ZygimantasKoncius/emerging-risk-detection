ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in the Companys common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Companys business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on, or that management currently deems immaterial, may also impair the Companys business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Companys common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS The Company Is Subject to Interest Rate Risk The Companys earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Companys control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Companys ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Companys mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Companys net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Companys results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect PAGE 10 on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion related to the Companys management of interest rate risk, see ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT beginning on page 32 in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company Is Subject to Lending Risk There are inherent risks associated with the Companys lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the Company operates as well as those throughout the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 65% of the Companys loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because the Companys loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non- performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion related to commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans, see Loan Portfolio on page 26 in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Companys Allowance for Loan Losses May Be Insufficient The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents managements best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects managements continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside the Companys control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion related to the Companys process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, see Asset Quality beginning on page 27 in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company May Not Be Able to Meet the Cash Flow Requirements of Its Depositors and Borrowers or Meet Its Operating Cash Needs to Fund Corporate Expansion and Other Activities Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors. The overall liquidity position of the bank and the parent company are regularly monitored to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Funding sources include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and non-core deposits. The bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. The bank also can borrow through the Federal Reserve Banks discount window. If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of PAGE 11 operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see Liquidity Risk beginning on page 33 in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Sterling Bancorp Relies on Dividends from Its Subsidiaries Sterling Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the parent companys common stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Sterling National Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay to the parent company. Also, Sterling Bancorps right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors. In the event Sterling National Bank is unable to pay dividends to Sterling Bancorp, Sterling Bancorp may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Companys common stock. The inability to receive dividends from Sterling National Bank could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. See Supervision and Regulation on pages 39 and Note 14 of the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company Is Subject to Environmental Liability Risk Associated with Lending Activities A portion of the Companys loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit the Companys ability to use or sell the affected property. Future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Companys exposure to environmental liability. Although the Company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Companys Profitability Depends Significantly on Local and Overall Economic Conditions The Companys success depends significantly on the economic conditions of the communities it serves and the general economic conditions of the United States. The Company has operations in New York City and the New York metropolitan area, as well as Virginia and other mid-Atlantic territories, and conducts business throughout the United States. The economic conditions in these areas and throughout the United States have a significant impact on the demand for the Companys products and services as well as the ability of the Companys customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Companys deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets, acts of God or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Severe Weather, Natural Disasters or Other Acts of God, Acts of War or Terrorism and Other External Events Could Significantly Impact the Companys Business Severe weather, natural disasters or other acts of God, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Companys ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Companys deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company Operates in a Highly Competitive Industry and Market Area The Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets the Company operates. Additionally, various out-of-state banks have entered the market areas in which the Company currently operates. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, PAGE 12 including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Companys competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Company does. The Companys ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:  The ability to develop, maintain and build upon customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets.  The ability to expand the Companys market position.  The scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands.  The rate at which the Company introduces new products and services relative to its competitors.  Customer satisfaction with the Companys level of service.  Industry and general economic trends. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Companys competitive position, which could adversely affect the Companys growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company Is Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision The Company, primarily through the parent company and the bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect the Companys lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See Supervision and Regulation on pages 39. The Companys Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented The Companys internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Companys controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company May Be Subject to a Higher Effective Tax Rate if Sterling Real Estate Holding Company, Inc. Fails to Qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Sterling Real Estate Holding Company Inc. (SREHC) operates as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. SREHC was established to acquire, hold and manage mortgage assets and other authorized investments to generate net income for distribution to its shareholders. For an entity to qualify as a REIT, it must satisfy the following six asset tests under the Internal Revenue Code each quarter: (1) 75% of the value of the REITs total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, and government securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REITs total assets may consist of securities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value of its total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (4) not more than 10% of the outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (5) not more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; and (6) a REIT cannot own securities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 20% of its total assets. At December 31, 2006, SREHC met all six quarterly asset tests. Also, a REIT must satisfy the following two gross income tests each year: (1) 75% of its gross income must be from qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its gross income must be derived from sources qualifying for the 75% test plus dividends, interest, PAGE 13 and gains from the sale of securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income for the taxable year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status for federal income tax purposes. For 2006, SREHC had met the two annual income tests and the distribution test. If SREHC fails to meet any of the required provisions and, therefore, does not qualify to be a REIT, our effective tax rate would increase. New Lines of Business or New Products and Services May Subject the Company to Additional Risks The Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls. Failure to manage these risks successfully in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. Potential Acquisitions May Disrupt the Companys Business and Dilute Shareholder Value The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are compatible and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:  Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company.  Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.  Difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company.  Potential disruption to the Companys business.  Potential diversion of the Companys management time and attention.  The possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company.  Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company.  Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. The Company regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Companys tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company May Not Be Able to Attract and Retain Skilled People The Companys success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the Company can be intense, and the Company may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Companys key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business because of their skills, knowledge of the Companys market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. The Company has employment agreements with two of its senior officers. The Companys Information Systems May Experience an Interruption or Breach in Security The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Companys customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Companys information systems could damage the Companys reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the PAGE 14 Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys reputation, financial condition and results of operations. The Company Continually Encounters Technological Change The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Companys future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of the customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Companys operations. Many of the Companys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to implement effectively new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to keep pace successfully with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business and, in turn, the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company Is Subject to Claims and Litigation Pertaining to Fiduciary Responsibility From time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Companys performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Companys performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any fiduciary liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK The Companys Stock Price Can Be Volatile Stock price volatility may make it more difficult to resell the Companys common stock when desired and at an attractive price. The Companys stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including, among other factors:  Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations.  Recommendations by securities analysts.  Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company.  News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry.  Perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or its competitors.  New technology used, or services offered, by competitors.  Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or its competitors.  Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated bene­fits from acquisitions.  Changes in government regulation.  Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause the Companys stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. The Trading Volume in the Companys Common Stock Is Less Than That of Other Larger Financial Services Companies Although the Companys common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Companys common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the trading volume of the Companys common stock, significant sales of the Companys common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the Companys stock price to fall. An Investment in the Companys Common Stock Is Not an Insured Deposit The Companys common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Companys common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Companys common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment. PAGE 15 The Companys Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and Shareholders Rights Plan as Well as Certain Banking Laws May Have an Anti-Takeover Effect Provisions of the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, and the Companys stock purchase rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Companys shareholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INDUSTRY The Earnings of Financial Services Companies Are Significantly Affected by General Business and Economic Conditions The Companys operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which the Company operates, all of which are beyond the Companys control. A deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for the Companys products and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Financial Services Companies Depend on the Accuracy and Completeness of Information About Customers and Counterparties In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business and, in turn, the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Consumers May Decide Not to Use Banks to Complete Their Financial Transactions Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and these lower-cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
