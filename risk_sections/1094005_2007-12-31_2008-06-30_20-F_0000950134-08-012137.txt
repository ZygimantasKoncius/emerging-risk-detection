D. Risk Factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Overview We are an online media company and value-added information services provider in China and the global Chinese communities. With a branded network of localized web sites targeting Greater China and overseas Chinese, we provide services through five major business lines including SINA.com (online news and content), SINA Mobile (mobile value-added services MVAS), SINA Community (Web 2.0-based services and games), SINA.net (search and enterprise solutions) and SINA E-Commerce (online shopping). Together these provide an array of services including region-focused online content channels, communication and community-based tools, audio and video streaming, casual games, search and directory, classified listings, MVAS, e-commerce and enterprise e-solutions. In turn, we generate revenues through advertising, MVAS and other fee-based services. Advertising and MVAS are currently the major sources of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue in the near term. The primary focus of our operations is in China, where we derive the majority of our revenues. Our operations in China are conducted primarily through significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Sina.com Technology (China) Co., Ltd., Beijing New Media Information Technology Co. Ltd., Fayco Network Technology Development (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd. and Beijing SINA Internet Technology Service Co. Ltd. and significant VIEs, including the ICP Company, Xunlong, Star VI, Wangxing and the IAD Company. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have accumulated earnings of $123.7 million and $66.0 million, respectively. We have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily using the net proceeds raised through the sale of preference shares prior to our initial public offering and the sale through our ordinary shares in the initial public offering and cash generated from operations. We raised additional capital through the issuance of zero-coupon, convertible, subordinated notes in July 2003. We intend to continue our investment in the development and enhancement of our products, content and services, as well as investment in sales and marketing. If we are unable to generate sufficient net income from our operations in the future, we may have to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek equity or debt financing. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, bad debts, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, financing operations, employee benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see the discussion in the section titled Recent Accounting Pronouncements below and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition Advertising Our advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising and, to a lesser extent, sponsorship arrangements. Online advertising arrangements allow advertisers to place advertisements on particular areas of our web sites, in particular formats and over particular periods of time. Sponsorship arrangements allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our web sites in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period. While the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are certain transactions that contain non-standard business terms and conditions. In addition, we have certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements (arrangements with more than one deliverable) that may include placement on specific properties. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including: 1) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements; 2) when to recognize revenue on the deliverables; and 3) whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition. MVAS We mainly rely on third-party operators for billing and transmission of our MVAS to our users. The determination of whether we are the primary obligor for a particular type of service is subjective in nature and is based on an evaluation of the terms of the arrangement. If the terms of the arrangement with operators were to change and cause us to no longer be the primary obligor to the users, we would have to record our MVAS revenues on a net basis. Consequently, this would cause a significant decline in our net revenues, but should not have a significant impact on our gross margin. During fiscal 2007, approximately 85% of our MVAS revenues were recorded on a gross basis. Due to the time lag between when the services are rendered and when the operator billing statements are received, MVAS revenues are estimated based on our internal records of billings and transmissions for the month, adjusting for prior periods confirmation rates with operators and prior periods discrepancies between internally estimated revenues and actual revenues confirmed by operators. The confirmation rate applied to the estimation of revenue is determined at the lower of the latest confirmation rate available and the average of six months historical rates available, provided that we have obtained confirmation rates for six months. If we have not yet received confirmation rates for six months, revenues would be deferred until billing statements are received from the operators. If subsequent billing statements from the operators differ significantly from managements estimates, our revenues could be materially impacted. In the past, one of the operators has requested resettlement of billings that were settled in previous periods and on which payments have been received. We have accrued for such credits to revenue based on a historical rolling average and the true-ups between accrued amounts and actual credit memos issued have not been significant. If operators request for a resettlement of billings for previous periods at an amount significantly higher than historical average, our revenues could be materially impacted. In addition, our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured, which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition. Income taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of 44 Table of Contents current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, and thus materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), on January 1, 2007. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates in the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These judgments, assumptions and estimates take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts of unrecognized, uncertain tax positions, if any, provided or to be provided for in our consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency Our reporting currency and functional currency are the U.S. dollar and our subsidiaries and VIEs in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan use their respective local currencies as their functional currencies. An entitys functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Management must use judgment in determining an entitys functional currency, assessing economic factors including cash flow, sales price, sales market, expense, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. Impact from exchange rate changes related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency is recorded as a gain and loss in our consolidated statements of operations, while impact from exchange rate changes related to translating a foreign entitys financial statements from the functional currency to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, is disclosed and accumulated in a separate component under the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. Different judgments or assumptions resulting in a change of functional currency may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. For fiscal 2007, our translation adjustment was $19.2 million and our transactional gain was approximately $1.1 million. Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis, or more frequently, if facts and circumstances warrant a review. We make judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. The timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of operations in our current reporting period that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. Application of goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to the reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value of each reporting unit which could trigger impairment. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these reporting units could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. See Note 2 Goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold or use is based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally from three to five years. Judgment is required to determine the estimated useful lives of assets, especially for computer equipment, including determining how long 45 Table of Contents existing equipment can function and when new technologies will be introduced at cost-effective price points to replace existing equipment. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with, SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), since January 1, 2006. We elected modified-prospective method, under which prior periods are not revisited for comparative purpose. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of share options. The determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee share option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. Furthermore, we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, we may need to revise those estimates used in subsequent periods. See Note 13 Stock-based Compensation under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the SFAS 123R disclosures. Marketable securities Our marketable securities are held as available for sale and are reported at fair value. The treatment of a decline in the fair value of an individual security is based on whether the decline is other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is required to assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Our judgment of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on an assessment of factors including our ability and intent to hold the individual security, severity of the impairment, expected duration of the impairment and forecasted recovery of fair value. Changes in the estimates and assumptions could affect our judgment of whether an identified impairment should be recorded as an unrealized loss in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets or as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects its best estimate of amounts that potentially will not be collected. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness and age of receivable balances. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if the operators decide not to pay the Company, additional allowances may be required which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Allowances for doubtful accounts charged to income were $5.3 million, $5.0 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Equity investments Our equity investments are comprised of joint ventures and other privately held companies. We account for equity investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method. For equity investments over which we do not have significant influence, the cost method of accounting is used. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment whenever events and changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the equity investment may not be fully recoverable. The impairment evaluation requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the equity investments. Equity investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other-than-temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the equity investments. The determination of fair value of the equity investments involves considering factors such as current economic and market conditions, the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and undiscounted cash flows and other company-specific information including recent financing rounds. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these 46 Table of Contents privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. Fair value determination, particularly for equity investments in privately-held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the equity investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other-than-temporary. Advertising expenses We expense all advertising costs as incurred and classify these costs under sales and marketing expenses. Advertising expenses include costs related to direct advertising that are intended to acquire subscribers for monthly subscription based and usage based MVAS. Assessing whether costs related to direct advertising should be expensed as incurred or capitalized and amortized over a longer period requires judgment, including determining whether the direct advertising activity has a primary purpose to elicit sales from customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and whether the activities would result in probable future economic benefits. Changes in assumptions could materially affect the manner in which direct advertising costs are expensed. Recent accounting pronouncements In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB14-1 Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB14-1), which requires issuers of convertible debt that may be settled wholly or partly in cash when converted to account for the debt and equity components separately. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP APB14-1 on its consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS142-3 Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS142-3), which amends the factors to be considered in determining the useful life of intangible assets. Its intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure its fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP FAS142-3 on its consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 161 on its consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141R on its consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. In December 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 (SAB 110). Under SAB 110, the Staff will continue to allow companies to use the simplified method for estimating the expected terms of plain vanilla share options beyond December 31, 2007, assuming certain circumstances are met. The adoption of SAB 110 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 160 on its consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. 47 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, companies may elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning fiscal 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No.157 (FSP FAS 157-2), which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). FSP FAS 157-2 partially defers the effective date of Statement 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. The Company will adopt SFAS 157 in 2008, except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in FSP FAS 157-2. The partial adoption of SFAS 157 in 2008 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the remaining SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. A. Operating Results Net revenues Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 % of Change (in thousands, except percentages) YOY YOY 07 & 06 06 & 05 Net Revenues Advertising $ 168,926 69 % $ 120,067 56 % $ 84,999 44 % 41 % 41 % Non-advertising: MVAS 70,489 29 % 86,257 41 % 98,070 51 % -18 % -12 % Others 6,712 2 % 6,530 3 % 10,483 5 % 3 % -38 % Subtotal 77,201 31 % 92,787 44 % 108,553 56 % -17 % -15 % Total net revenues $ 246,127 100 % $ 212,854 100 % $ 193,552 100 % 16 % 10 % The year-over-year increase in total net revenues for 2007 and 2006 was 16% and 10%, respectively. This was primarily due to the year-over-year increase in advertising revenues, partially offset by the year-over-year decrease in MVAS revenues. Advertising revenues as a percentage of total net revenues grew to 69% in 2007 from 56% in 2006 and 44% in 2005 while MVAS revenues declined to 29% in 2007 from 41% in 2006 and 51% in 2005. Advertising. Advertising revenues grew 41% year-over-year in 2007 and in 2006. These increases were primarily due to the increase in the number of advertisers, price and overall average spending per advertiser in China. For 2007, advertising revenues from China accounted for 98% of our total advertising revenues, compared to 97% and 96% of our total advertising revenues for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total number of advertisers in China was approximately 1,080 in 2007, compared to approximately 980 and 790 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Average revenue per advertising customer in China was approximately $150K in 2007, as compared to approximately $120K and $100K in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our top ten customers in aggregate generated approximately 16%, 16% and 15% of our advertising revenues in the PRC in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Automobile, real estate and information technology were our top three advertising sectors, accounting in aggregate for approximately 52%, 53% and 47% of our advertising revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The key sectors contributing to our advertising growth in 2007 included automobile, financial and fast moving consumption goods. Non-advertising. Non-advertising revenues consist of MVAS and, to a lesser extent, fee-based revenues. MVAS revenues declined 18% and 12% year-over-year in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which was the primary reason for the declines of non-advertising revenues in 2007 and 2006. 48 Table of Contents MVAS Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 % of Change (in thousands, except percentages) YOY YOY 07 & 06 06 & 05 2.0G products $ 55,404 79 % $ 73,665 85 % $ 83,745 85 % -25 % -12 % 2.5G products 15,085 21 % 12,592 15 % 14,325 15 % 20 % -12 % Total MVAS revenues $ 70,489 100 % $ 86,257 100 % $ 98,070 100 % -18 % -12 % Revenues from 2.0G products, mostly SMS, IVR, CRBT, decreased 25% and 12% year-over-year in 2007 and 2006, respectively. SMS is the largest component of our MVAS and is the primarily factor for the year-over-year declines in MVAS revenues. Revenues from SMS were $35.8 million, $55.4 million and $71.5 million or 51%, 64% and 73% of total MVAS revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The declines in SMS revenues in 2007 and 2006 were largely due to higher churn rates by our monthly subscription users, less effective means to recruit new users and, in general, tightening operator policies and regulatory environment in China. IVR revenues were $15.5 million, $15.0 million and $7.4 million or 22%, 17% and 7% of total MVAS revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The year-over-year growth of IVR revenues in 2006 was primarily due to increased promotion and the addition of IVR service with China Telecom. Revenues from CRBT increased 32% to $4.1 million in 2007 as a result of increased marketing efforts. It declined 35% in 2006 due to less marketing efforts. Revenues from 2.5G products, including MMS, WAP and Kjava, increased 20% year-over-year in 2007 while declining 12% year-over-year in 2006. MMS increased 7% in 2007 to $4.0 million but declined 41% in 2006. The year-over-year decrease in 2006 was mainly due to certain changes by China Mobile, including the switch to a new billing platform as well as policy changes on monthly subscription service. WAP revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $6.4 million in 2007, compared to a decline of 1% year-over-year in 2006. The increase in WAP revenues in 2007 was mainly due to higher ranking of the Company on the China Mobile Monternet portal. Kjava grew 55% year-over-year to $4.7 million in 2007, compared to a 41% increase in 2006. The increases in Kjava revenues were mainly due to increased game offerings, sales channel and general market demand. In the past, operators have made significant changes to their policies on mobile value-added services in accordance with policy derivatives from MII. The policy changes by the operators have significantly reduced our ability to acquire new MVAS subscribers and increased churn rate of our existing monthly MVAS subscribers. In addition, our MVAS business has been impacted by other regulatory arms in China, such as SARFT. The key policy changes made by operators in 2006 and 2007 included the following:  In July 2006, China Mobile made significant changes to their policy on subscription-based MVAS, which were intended to address a number of issues, including reducing subscriber complaints, increasing customer satisfaction and promoting healthy development of MVAS industry in China. The key changes include requiring double confirmations on new MVAS subscriptions as well as sending SMS reminders to existing monthly subscribers of SMS, MMS and WAP to inform them of their MVAS subscriptions and fee information. In September 2006, China Unicom began enforcing double confirmations on new subscription services. We have not been able to estimate the impact of these policy changes on our results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions, but believe it has reduced and will continue to significantly reduce our ability to acquire new monthly MVAS subscribers and increase the churn rate of our existing monthly MVAS subscribers. Revenues from subscription-based MVAS in 2007 accounted for approximately 37 % of our total MVAS revenues.  In August 2007, the MII tightened the regulations over direct advertising in China. This change reduced the effectiveness of our direct advertising on MVAS and increased the difficulties of new user recruitment. We have not been able to estimate the impact of such changes on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, but believe it has had and will continue to have a significant negative impact to our MVAS business. Revenues from direct-advertising-based MVAS in 2007 accounted for approximately 24 % of our total MVAS revenues.  In April 2007, China Unicom changed its service fee settlement method with service providers from estimated collection to actual collection. As a result of the switch, fee settlement, based on the receipt of billing statement, with China Unicom has taken up to four months, which has negatively impacted our cash flow. In addition, if we are unable to rely on historical confirmation rates from China Unicom as a result of the change in fee settlement method, we may need to defer recognition of such revenues until the billing statements are received. Revenues billed via China Unicom in 2007 were $16.7 million.  In July 2007, China Mobile began implementing a score and ranking system that attempts to reward service providers based on certain factors, such as revenue size, revenue growth rate and user complaint volume. A low score or ranking by any of our 49 Table of Contents mobile entities would significantly result in a negative impact to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Revenues billed via China Mobile in 2007 were $51.6 million.  In December 2007, the MII unified the dialing codes of each service provider by adding a four-digit code to each service providers product. This complicates the purchasing process of MVAS and may reduce the effectiveness of our direct advertising and increase the difficulties of new user recruitment. We are unable to estimate the impact of such changes on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition at this time. Operators, such as China Mobile and China Unicom, and governmental bodies, such as the MII and SARFT, may announce additional measures or regulations in the future, which may adversely impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are in the process of developing and promoting new products that we believe are not subject to recent policy and regulations changes made by operators and governmental bodies. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop any such new products, that any such products will achieve market acceptance or that such products will not be affected by future changes in rules and regulations. Other non-advertising revenues Other non-advertising revenues include enterprise services such as paid search and directory listings, e-commerce and other fee-based services, such as paid email services and causal games. Other non-advertising revenues increased 3% in 2007 and decreased 38% in 2006. The year-over-year decrease in other non-advertising revenues in 2006 was mainly due to revenue declines from paid search and directory listings, loss of revenues from the sale of our online hotel-booking business in the third quarter of 2005 and the sale of our interest in an online auction joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2005. Revenues from paid search and directory listings accounted for 41%, 55% and 58% of our other non-advertising revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Costs of revenues Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 % of Change % of Change YOY 07 & 06 YOY 06 & 05 (In thousands, except percentages) Costs of revenues: Advertising $ 63,466 $ 42,529 $ 27,627 49 % 54 % Non-advertising: MVAS 29,339 34,255 33,814 -14 % 1 % Other 1,897 2,626 1,666 -28 % 58 % Subtotal 31,236 36,881 35,480 -15 % 4 % Total costs of revenues $ 94,702 $ 79,410 $ 63,107 19 % 26 % Costs of revenues increased 19% and 26% year-over-year in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases were mainly contributed by higher costs of advertising revenues. Advertising. Costs of advertising revenues primarily consist of expenses associated with the production of our web sites, which include fees paid to third parties for Internet connection, content and services, personnel-related costs and equipment depreciation expenses associated with our web site production. Costs of advertising revenues also include the business taxes on advertising sales in the PRC. Business taxes, surcharges and cultural business construction fees levied on advertising sales account for approximately 8.5% of the advertising revenues in China. Costs of advertising revenues increased 49% and 54% year-over-year in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases were due to higher content fees, Internet connection costs associated with the additional bandwidth and web production costs driven by an increase in web production personnel, as well as the increase in business taxes associated with higher advertising revenues. These increases were driven by the need to provide additional resources to support our web traffic and advertising revenue growth. Costs of advertising revenues for 2007 and 2006 included stock-based compensation of $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Non-advertising. Costs of non-advertising revenues consist mainly of fees paid to third-party operators for their services relating to the collection of our MVAS revenues and for using their transmission gateways and fees or royalties paid to third-party content providers for services and contents associated with our MVAS. Costs of non-advertising revenues also include business 50 Table of Contents taxes and surcharges levied on non-advertising sales in the PRC. Business taxes and surcharges levied on non-advertising revenues are approximately 3.3% for mobile related revenues and 5.5% for other non-advertising revenues. Costs of MVAS revenues decreased 14% year-over-year in 2007 and increased 1% year-over-year in 2006. Fees retained by or paid to operators for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $16.5 million, $24.7 million and $24.7 million, respectively, or 23%, 29% and 25%, respectively, of our MVAS revenues. Fees paid to third party content providers and channel distributors for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $11.4 million, $7.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively, or 16%, 9% and 6%, respectively, of our MVAS revenues. Historical cost of MVAS revenue trends may not be indicative of future results, as the operators in China have made changes to the way service fees are charged. For example, starting in January 2007, we were required to switch from using our own platform for the delivery of IVR services to that of China Mobile. Consequently, China Mobiles service fees for IVR increased from 15% to 30%. China Mobile, China Unicom and other operators may further change their fee policies, which may have a material and adverse impact to our results of operation, financial position and cash flow. Costs of other non-advertising revenue also include costs for providing our enterprise services and other fee-based services. For 2006, costs of other non-advertising revenues include a $1.1 million write-off of prepaid royalty related to our iGame based on managements assessment of the game business. Gross profit margins Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Gross profit margins: Advertising 62 % 65 % 67 % Non-advertising: MVAS 58 % 60 % 66 % Other 72 % 60 % 84 % Subtotal 60 % 60 % 67 % Overall 62 % 63 % 67 % Overall gross margin decreased one percentage point year-over-year to 62% for 2007 and dropped four percentage points year-over-year to 63% for 2006. Advertising. The year-over-year decrease in advertising gross profit margin in 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to the increased investment in our web site production and Internet connection. In addition, starting January 1, 2006, we began to expense stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R. Stock-based compensation for 2007 and 2006 both accounted for approximately 1% of our advertising revenues. We expect to continue to increase our investments in the production of web content and Internet connection in absolute dollars to maintain our competitiveness. Non-advertising. The majority of the costs associated with non-advertising revenues are variable costs. Gross margin for non-advertising revenues remained flat at 60% in 2007 but decreased seven percentage points year-over-year to 60% for 2006. Gross margin for MVAS decreased two percentage points and six percentage points, respectively, year-over-year in 2007 and 2006. These decreases were mainly driven by the increased transmission and content provision and channel distribution costs as a percentage of our MVAS revenues. We expect further increases in fees paid to operators and content providers as a percentage of MVAS revenues, which will result in continuing decline in MVAS gross margin in the future. Operating expenses Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 % of change (In thousands, except percentages) % of net % of net % of net YOY YOY revenues revenues revenues 07 & 06 06 & 05 Sales and marketing expenses $ 50,555 21 % $ 49,972 23 % $ 51,690 27 % 1 % -3 % Product development expenses $ 21,942 9 % $ 19,573 9 % $ 15,268 8 % 12 % 28 % General and administrative expenses $ 26,738 11 % $ 27,172 13 % $ 18,820 10 % -2 % 44 % 51 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses, sales commissions, advertising and promotional expenditures and travel expenses. The year-over-year increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2007 was primarily due to higher sales commissions and corporate branding spending, which was partially offset by lower promotional expenditures from the MVAS business. The year-over-year decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2006 was primarily due to lower promotional expenditures from the MVAS business, partially offset by higher payroll-related expenses, such as sales commissions from the advertising business, bonuses, and stock-based compensation expenses. Marketing expenses related to MVAS were $12.5 million, $13.7 million and $21.2 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Stock-based compensation expenses were $1.2 million and $1.5 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Product development expenses. Product development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses incurred for the enhancement to and maintenance of our web sites as well as costs associated with new product development and enhancement for products such as blog, video podcasting, email and search engine. The year-over-year increases for 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to increases in headcount and higher depreciation expenses, resulting from additional purchases of capital equipment. Product development expenses in 2007 and 2006 also included stock-based compensation of $1.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively. We expect our product development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near future. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation costs, professional service fees, and provisions for doubtful accounts. Our general and administrative expenses also include expenses relating to the transfer of the economic benefits generated from our VIEs in the PRC to our subsidiaries, which were $6.7 million, $5.9 million and $5.0 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in 2007 was mainly due to the decrease in bonus expenses and professional fees, partially offset by the increase in expenses relating to the transfer of the economic benefits generated from our VIEs in the PRC to our subsidiaries. The year-over-year increase in 2006 was mainly due to the increase in provision for doubtful accounts, as a result of the increase in advertising revenues, increase in expenses relating to the transfer of the economic benefits generated from our VIEs in the PRC to our subsidiaries, increase in personnel compensation and the addition of stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expenses were $4.1 million and $4.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangibles was approximately $1.2 million, or less than 1% of total net revenues, in 2007, compared with $1.8 million, or 1%, in 2006 and $3.2 million, or 2%, in 2005. As of December 31, 2007, the net carrying amount of our intangible assets represents purchased technology, which is being amortized over its useful life through 2014. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on intangible assets, including estimates of amortization expenses for future periods. Interest and other income Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Interest Income $ 11,522 $ 8,510 $ 6,551 Other Income 1,209 39  $ 12,731 $ 8,549 $ 6,551 The year-over-year increases on interest income in 2007 and 2006 were due to higher balances of cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments as well as higher interest rates overall in 2007 and 2006. Other income mainly represents net transaction gain or loss on our foreign currency transactions. Amortization of convertible debt issuance cost As a result of our issuance of zero-coupon, convertible, subordinated notes in July 2003, we recorded convertible debt issuance cost of approximately $2.7 million. This amount was amortized on a straight-line basis over four years ending in June 2007. The amortization expense for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively. 52 Table of Contents Gain on sale of business and equity investments, net The following summarizes the gain and (loss) on the sale of business and investments: Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Bravado $  $ 161 $ 1,487 COAL   2,649 Shanghai NC Soft  2,006  Others 830 (134 )  $ 830 $ 2,033 $ 4,136 % of total net revenues * 1 % 2 % * Less than 1% During the third quarter of 2005, we sold our online hotel business Bravado Investments Limited Bravado to Elong Inc. Total gain from the sale was $1.6 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we sold our 33% interest in COAL (a.k.a. 1Pai.com), an online auction joint venture with Yahoo!, to Alibaba.com, and recorded a gain of $2.6 million from the sale. During second quarter of 2006, we sold our 51% interest in Shanghai NC SINA, a game joint venture with NC Soft, to NC Soft, and recorded a gain of $2.0 million from the sale. During the second quarter of 2007, we sold our equity investment in a private company and recorded a gain of $0.8 million from the sale.

The increase in effective income tax rate from 5% in 2005 to 7% in 2006 was due to the phasing out of tax holidays of certain of our legal entities, while the increase to 9% in 2007 was primarily due to higher taxable income generated by higher tax rate entities. The EIT Law and the Implementing Rules became effective as of January 1, 2008. Although many implementation issues of the EIT Law remain unclear, based on our current understanding of the EIT Law, we expect significantly higher effective tax rate in the future. Prior to the EIT Law, our subsidiaries and VIEs were governed by the Previous IT Law and were generally subject to enterprise income tax at a statutory rate of 33% (30% state income tax plus 3% local income tax). The EIT Law supplemented by the Implementing Rules supersedes the Previous IT Law and unifies the enterprise income tax rate for FIEs and domestic enterprises at 25%. New and high technology enterprises will continue to enjoy a preferential tax rate of 15%, but must meet the criteria defined under the EIT Law and related regulations. The EIT Law provides a five-year transitional period for certain 53 Table of Contents entities that had enjoyed a favorable income tax rate of less than 25% under the Previous IT Law and was established before March 16, 2007, during which period the applicable enterprises income tax rate shall gradually increase to 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides grandfather treatment for new and high technology enterprises that received special tax holidays under the Previous IT Law, which allows them to continue to enjoy their tax holidays until expiration. Most of our FIEs operations in China would enjoy an effective income tax rate of 7.5% in 2008 under the Previous IT Law and some of our VIEs would enjoy a favorable income tax rate of less than 25% under the Previous IT Law. The Companys ultimate effective tax rate starting in 2008 will depend on many factors, including but not limited to, whether certain of the Companys FIEs in China will receive the new and high technology enterprise status under the EIT Law. If the Companys FIEs fail to receive the new and high technology enterprise status, the Companys PRC consolidated effective tax rate may increase significantly to as high as 27%. The EIT Law also provides that enterprises established under the laws of foreign countries or regions but whose de facto management body is located in the PRC be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax at the rate of 25% for its global income. The Implementing Rules of the EIT Law merely defines the location of the de facto management body as the place where the exercising, in substance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties, etc., of a non-PRC company is located. The determination of tax residency requires a review of surrounding facts and circumstances of each case. If SINA is treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, SINA will be subject to PRC tax on worldwide income at a uniform tax rate of 25% starting from January 1, 2008. The EIT Law also imposes a 10% withholding income tax on dividends generated on or after January 1, 2008 and distributed by a resident enterprise to its foreign investors, if such foreign investors are considered as non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with such foreign investors establishment or place within China, unless such foreign investors jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Such withholding income tax was exempted under the Previous IT Law. The Cayman Islands, where we are incorporated, does not have such a tax treaty with China. According to the arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion in August 2006, dividends paid by an FIE to its foreign investors in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5% (if the foreign investor owns directly at least 25% of the shares of the FIE). A majority of our subsidiaries in China are directly invested and held by Hong Kong registered entities. If we are regarded as a non-resident enterprise and our Hong Kong entities are regarded as resident enterprises, then our Hong Kong entities may be required to pay a 10% withholding tax on any dividends payable to us. If our Hong Kong entities are regarded as non-resident enterprises, then our subsidiaries in China will be required to pay a 5% withholding tax for any dividends payable to our Hong Kong entities. In either case, the amount of funds available to us, including the payment of dividends to our shareholders, could be materially reduced. In addition, because there remains uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules, if we are regarded as a PRC resident enterprise, we cannot guarantee that any dividends to be distributed by us to our non-PRC shareholders will not be subject to a withholding tax, nor can we guarantee that any gains realized by such non-PRC shareholders from the transfer of our shares will not be subject to a withholding tax. If we are required under the EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our non-PRC shareholders or any gains realized by our non-PRC shareholders from transfer of the shares, their investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, the Company may decide not to distribute its retained earnings and maintain such cash onshore to reinvest in its PRC operations. During 2007, we reassessed our deferred tax assets assuming the 25% effective tax rate under the EIT Law. Historically, deferred tax assets were calculated using old statutory rate 33% or applicable preferential rates of 7.5% or 15% of the respective legal entities. As a result of the reassessment, we wrote down $0.4 million in deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2007. Our VIEs are wholly owned by our employees and controlled by us through various contractual arrangements. To the extent that these VIEs have undistributed after-tax net income, we have to pay taxes on behalf of its employees when dividends are distributed from these local entities in the future. Such dividend tax rate is 20%. For further information on our tax structures and inherent risks see If tax benefits available to us in China are reduced or repealed, our results of operations could suffer significantly and your investment in our shares may be adversely affected. under Risk Factors in Part I Item 1A. See also Note 8  Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes. 54 Table of Contents B. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 477,999 $ 362,751 $ 300,689 Working capital $ 377,608 $ 267,116 $ 297,910 Shareholders equity $ 494,976 $ 387,813 $ 319,622 We have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily using the $97.5 million raised through the sale of preference shares, the $68.8 million raised from the sale of ordinary shares in the initial public offering and the $97.3 million raised from the sale of zero-coupon, convertible, subordinated notes in July 2003, as well as cash generated from operations. On July 7, 2003, we issued $100 million aggregate amount of zero-coupon, convertible, subordinated notes (the Notes) due 2023 in a private offering, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $97.3 million. The Notes were issued at par and bear no interest. The Notes are convertible into our ordinary shares, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, at an initial conversion price of $25.79 per share, subject to adjustments for certain events. Upon conversion, we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of ordinary shares, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares. During 2007, one million dollars of the Notes were converted as SINA ordinary shares, resulting in a balance of $99.0 million in outstanding Notes as of December 31, 2007. We may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes on or after July 15, 2012, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes. The purchasers may require us to repurchase all or part of the Notes for cash on July 15 annually from 2007 through 2013, and on July 15, 2018, and upon a change of control, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes. Based on the circumstances and information provided to us as of December 31, 2007, we do not believe that it is likely the purchasers will require us to repurchase the Notes in 2008. We filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 for the resale of the Notes and the ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, which Registration Statement is no longer effective. One of the conditions for conversion of the Notes to SINA ordinary shares is that the sale price (defined as closing per share sales price) of SINA ordinary shares reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time. The specified thresholds are i) during the period from issuance to July 15, 2022, if the sale price of SINA ordinary shares, for each of any five consecutive trading days in the immediately preceding quarter, exceeds 115% of the conversion price per ordinary share, and ii) during the period from July 15, 2022 to July 15, 2023, if the sale price of SINA ordinary shares on the previous trading day is more than 115% of the conversion price per ordinary share. The closing price of our ordinary shares on December 31, 2007, the last trading day of 2007, was $44.31. For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the sale price of SINA ordinary shares exceed 115% of the conversion price per ordinary share for five consecutive trading days. The Notes are therefore convertible into SINA ordinary shares for the quarter ending March 31, 2008 in accordance with threshold (i) described above. Upon a purchasers election to convert the Notes in the future periods, we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of ordinary shares, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2007, we had $478.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet the future requirements of our operating activities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, we may sell additional equities or obtain credit facilities to enhance our liquidity position or to increase our cash reserve for future acquisitions. The sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The following tables set forth the movements of our cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented. Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 89,065 $ 63,097 $ 58,273 Net cash used in investing activities (5,857 ) (850 ) (133,810 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 19,037 9,979 7,015 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 6,244 2,541 3,164 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 108,489 74,767 (65,358 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 163,177 88,410 153,768 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 271,666 $ 163,177 $ 88,410 55 Table of Contents Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 was $89.1 million. This was primarily attributable to our net income of $57.7 million, adjusted by non-cash related expenses including depreciation of $13.4 million, stock-based compensation of $8.7 million, amortization of intangible assets of $1.2 million, allowance for doubtful accounts of $5.3 million, amortization of convertible debt issuance cost of $0.3 million, and a net increase in cash from working capital items of $2.7 million, offset by gains from the sale of investments of $0.8 million. The net increase in working capital items was mainly due to increase in account receivables which resulted from the significant increase in our advertising revenues during 2007, partially offset by the increase in income tax payable and accrued liabilities for items such as ad agency rebates, content fees, bandwidth costs, sales commissions, bonuses, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 was $63.1 million. This was primarily attributable to our net income of $39.9 million, adjusted by non-cash related expenses including depreciation of $9.9 million, stock-based compensation of $9.5 million, amortization of intangible assets of $1.8 million, allowance for doubtful accounts of $5.0 million, amortization of convertible debt issuance cost of $0.7 million, and net losses from equity investments of $0.7 million, offset by gains from the sale of businesses and investments of $2.0 million and a net decrease in cash from working capital items of $2.2 million. The net decrease in working capital items was mainly due to increase in account receivables which resulted from the significant increase in our advertising revenues during 2006, partially offset by the increase in income tax payable and accrued liabilities such as sales rebates, content fees, bandwidth costs, sales commission, bonuses, and overall marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2005 was $58.3 million. This was primarily attributable to our net income of $43.1 million, adjusted by non-cash related expenses including depreciation of $9.6 million, amortization of intangible assets of $3.2 million, an impairment charge on investment in Tidetime Sun of $3.2 million, allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.3 million, amortization of convertible debt issuance cost of $0.7 million, and net losses from equity investments of $2.8 million, offset by a gain from the sale of business of $4.1 million and a net decrease in cash from working capital items of $2.3 million. The decrease in working capital items was mainly due to decrease in accrued liabilities such as customer advance, withholding tax from employees and sales rebates offset by decreased accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets. The decrease in account receivables resulted from better collection. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2007 was $5.9 million. This was primarily due to equipment purchases of $12.2 million and investment in a private company of $1.3 million. This was partly offset by the net proceeds from the maturities of short-term investments of $5.6 million and the sales of equity investment of $2.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities for 2006 was $0.9 million. This was primarily due to equipment purchases of $14.1 million and additional consideration related to Crillion acquisition of $11.3 million. This was partly offset by the net proceeds from the maturities of short-term investments of $18.0 million, the sales of equity investments of $5.3 million, Bravado of $0.6 million and Tidetime Sun of $0.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities for 2005 was $133.8 million. This was primarily due to the net purchase of short-term investments of $90.5 million, additional considerations related to acquisitions of Bravado, Crillion and Davilhill totaling $26.1 million, equipment purchases of $15.4 million and additional equity investments of $3.0 million. This was partly offset by the proceeds of $1.7 million from the sale of Bravado. Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, and was primarily related to the proceeds from the exercise of share options. 56 Table of Contents C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. Not applicable. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any unconsolidated third parties. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. Moreover, we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. F. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments due by period Less than one One to Three to More than Total year three years five years five years ( In thousands) Operating lease obligations $ 7,333 $ 4,691 $ 2,642 $  $  Purchase commitments 43,232 34,029 8,724 434 45 Total contractual obligations $ 50,565 $ 38,720 $ 11,366 $ 434 $ 45 Operating lease obligations include the commitments under the lease agreements for our office premises. We lease office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates beginning 2005 through 2010. Rental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $4.9 million, $3.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Based on the current rental lease agreements, future minimum rental payments required as of December 31, 2007 are $4.7 million, $2.6 million and $77,000 for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The majority of the commitments are from our office lease agreements in the PRC. Purchase commitments mainly include minimum commitments for Internet connection fees associated with web site production, content fees associated with web site production and MVAS, advertising serving services and marketing activities. There are uncertainties regarding the legal basis of our ability to operate an Internet business and telecom value-added services in China. Although the country has implemented a wide range of market-oriented economic reforms, the telecommunication, information and media industries remain highly regulated. Not only are such restrictions currently in place, but in addition regulations are unclear as to in which specific segments of these industries companies with foreign investors, including us, may operate. Therefore, we might be required to limit the scope of our operations in China, and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Amounts of Compensation Paid and Benefits Granted Compensation In 2007, we paid an aggregate of approximately $1.9 million in cash compensation to our executive officers and non-employee directors as a group. Our executive officers are eligible to receive cash bonuses which are paid on the basis of their success in achieving designated individual goals and the Companys success in achieving specific company-wide goals. Specifically, our executive officers were eligible to earn a cash bonus based on 2007 Company performance pursuant to the 2007 Management Bonus Plan (the 2007 Bonus Plan). Under the 2007 Bonus Plan, a total bonus pool of up to 1% of 2007 adjusted net income before taxes was established upon the satisfaction of certain performance goals set up by the Compensation Committee. The aggregate amount of such incentive cash bonuses awarded under the 2007 Bonus Plan has been included in the above total amount of cash compensation to our executive officers and non-employee directors as a group. Effective as of June 23, 2006, each non-employee director receives an annual cash retainer of $20,000, the Chair of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual cash retainer of $5,000 and the Chair of the Compensation Committee receives an additional annual cash retainer of $3,000.

In November 2007, we granted an aggregate of 200,000 shares of restricted share units, half of which were serviced-based and the other half were performance-based, to our executive officers as a group. Our executive officers are not required to pay any consideration to the Company at the time of grant of a restricted share unit. We will settle the award in our ordinary shares upon the achievement by our executive officers of the vesting conditions prescribed by our Board of Directors. Restricted share units that do not vest as prescribed will be forfeited. In December 2007, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 84,000 of our ordinary shares to our non-employee directors as a group.

Share Incentive Plans Our board of directors and shareholders approved the issuance of up to 5,000,000 common shares upon exercise of awards granted under the 2007 Share Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan). The 2007 Plan permits the granting of share options, share appreciation rights, restricted share units and restricted shares. The 2007 Plan has a five-year term with a fixed number of shares authorized for issuance. The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be granted subject to awards under the 2007 Plan during any given fiscal year will be limited to 3% of the total outstanding shares of the Company as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year, plus any shares remaining available under the share pool for the immediately preceding fiscal year. Share options and share appreciation rights must be granted with an exercise price of at least 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Concurrently with the adoption of the 2007 Plan, all remaining shares available for grant under the Companys existing 1999 Stock Plan, 1999 Executive Stock Option Plan and 1999 Director Stock Option Plan were forfeited.

The Company will also reimburse such executive officer over the twelve months following termination (or in the case of Mr. Chao, over the Severance Period) for health insurance benefits with the same coverage provided to such executive officer prior to his or her termination, provided that reimbursement for the first six months shall be paid on the six-month anniversary of such executive officers termination date and reimbursement for any remaining health insurance benefits shall be paid on the first day of each month during which such executive officer receives such health insurance benefits. Any unvested share options or shares of restricted stock held by such executive officer as of the date of his or her Involuntary Termination will vest as to that number of shares that such executive officer would have vested over the twelve-month period following his or her termination (or in the case of Mr. Chao, during the Severance Period) if he or she had continued employment with the Company through such period, and such executive officer shall be entitled to exercise any such share options through the date that is the later of (x) the 15th day of the third month following the date the share options would otherwise expire, or (y) the end of the calendar year in which the share options would otherwise expire. Such executive officer is not eligible for any severance benefits if his employment is terminated voluntarily or if he or she is terminated for cause. In the event that an executive officer voluntarily elects to terminate his or her employment, he or she will receive payment(s) for all salary and unpaid vacation accrued as of the date of his termination of employment and his or her benefits will be continued in accordance with our then-existing benefits plans and policies in effect on the date of termination and in accordance with applicable law. In the event that an executive officers employment is terminated for cause, then he or she shall not be entitled to receive payment of any severance benefits, but he will receive payment(s) for all salary and unpaid vacation accrued as of the date of such termination and his or her benefits will be continued in accordance with our then-existing benefits plans and policies in effect on the date of termination and in accordance with applicable law. In the event that an executive officers employment with the Company terminates as a result of his or her death or disability, such executive officers estate or representative will receive the amount of such executive officers target bonus for the fiscal year in which the death or disability occurs to the extent that the bonus has been earned as of the date of such death or disability, as determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee based on the specific corporate and individual performance targets established for such fiscal year. In addition, the change of control agreement between the Company and the executive officers, as further described below under Terms of Potential Payments  Change of Control, provides that if the termination is by reason of death or disability, such executive officer will be entitled to continued payment of his or her full base salary at the rate then in effect on the date of termination for a period of one year from the date of termination. Terms of Potential Payments  Change of Control In addition to the employment agreements described above, the Company has also entered into a change of control agreement with its executive officers. Under the change of control agreements, in general, a change of control shall be deemed to occur if (i) any person or entity acquires more than fifty percent or more of the combined voting power of the Companys outstanding securities, (ii) during any period of two consecutive years there is an unwelcome change in a majority of the members of our board of directors, (iii) we merge or consolidate with another organization (other than a merger where our shareholders continue to own more than fifty percent of the combined voting power and with the power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors), (iv) our shareholders approve a complete liquidation or an agreement for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Companys assets, (v) there occurs any other event of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act. The change of control agreement provides for certain severance benefits in the event of a change of control as well as in the event of an involuntary termination after a change of control. Upon a change of control in which the successor corporation does not assume outstanding options, all such options shall become fully vested and exercisable. In addition, if an executive officers employment with the Company terminates without cause or if he or she resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the change of control agreements) within 24 months following a change of control, such executive officer will receive a pro-rata amount of the full value of any targeted annual bonus for the year in which he terminates, 100% of his or her annual base salary and 100% of his or her targeted annual bonus for the year in which he or she terminates, reimbursement in full of the applicable insurance premiums for him or her and his or her eligible dependents for first eighteen months that he or she and his or her dependents are eligible for health insurance coverage if a continuance of health insurance benefits are elected, continued D&O insurance coverage for six years after his or her termination, and an acceleration of all stock awards that are unvested as of his or her termination date. The change of control agreement also provide for a payment of an amount equal to the full value of the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code should the executive officer be subject to the excise tax on golden parachute payments under the Internal Revenue Code. Except as set forth above, we have no service contracts with any of our directors that provide benefits to them upon termination. D. Employees As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 2,080 full-time employees, approximately 2,030 of whom are employed in China with the remaining employed in the United States of America, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Commercial Contracts In February 2008, we moved our business and operations related to our real-estate and home decoration channels into a new subsidiary. The new subsidiary entered into a ten-year licensing agreement with E-House (China) Holdings Limited (eHouse). Mr. Charles Chao, Chief Executive Officer and a director of SINA, is a board member of eHouse. Under the agreement, eHouse will provide its CRIC database to our new subsidiary to support its business-to-consumer website targeted at real estate and home decoration consumers. Both SINA and eHouse will each contribute $2.5 million cash into the Companys new subsidiary. In return, SINA and eHouse will receive 66% and 34% interest, respectively, in the Companys subsidiary. In April 2007, SINA.com Technology (China) Co. Ltd., one of our subsidiaries, entered into an agreement with BroadVision Inc. (BroadVision). Mr. Pehong Chen, a director of SINA, is the controlling stockholder of BroadVision and is currently serving as its Chairman, CEO and President. As of March 23, 2007, Mr. Chen beneficially owned approximately 39% of common stock of BroadVision. Under the agreement, BroadVision will provide customization and hosting service for our HR information management system in China. We paid BroadVision a total of RMB1,000,000 or $0.12 million in 2007, including RMB500,000 or $0.06 million for system implementation service and another RMB500,000 or $0.06 million for the software subscription, and starting from 2008, we will pay a yearly subscription fee of RMB500,000 or $0.06 million for the software subscription and system upgrade, feature enhance and technical support. Under the agreement, we have an option to buy out the software license from BroadVision on a non-exclusive basis by paying a lump-sum amount (RMB2,000,000 or $0.24 million, RMB1,500,000 or $0.18 million, or RMB1,000,000 or $0.12 million for buy-out in 2008, 2009 or 2010 or later, respectively) plus a 22% of the buy-out amount for maintenance services. During the year 2007, a VIE of the Company entered into technical support contracts with a 19%-owned, privately-held, equity-invested company. Technical support services fees charged by the privately-held, equity-invested company to the VIE was $0.4 million during the year and no amount was due to it as of December 31, 2007. Control Agreements PRC law currently limits foreign equity ownership of companies that provide certain Internet related, MVAS and advertising businesses. To comply with these PRC regulations, we operate our websites and provide certain online services in China through a series of contractual arrangements with our VIEs, which are PRC domestic companies, and their shareholders. Such contractual arrangements are as follows:  Our subsidiary STC agreed to provide Yan Wang, our former Chief Executive Officer and current Chairman of the Board, an interest-free loan of RMB300,000 for purposes of providing capital to Beijing SINA Internet Information Services Co., Ltd. and RMB300,000 for purposes of providing capital to Guangdong SINA Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. The entire principal amount of each of these loans is currently outstanding. Each of these loans was extended as replacement for loans previously extended to Mr. Wang by BSIT in the same principal amounts disclosed above and on the same terms as described below, except where noted, which loans were replaced by the STC loans due to BSIT being dissolved by the Company. 69 Table of Contents  STC also agreed to provide Tong Chen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Editor, interest-free loans totaling RMB300,000 for purposes of providing capital to Guangdong SINA Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. In addition, STC has agreed to provide Tong Chen interest-free loans totaling RMB4,500,000 for purposes of providing capital to Beijing SINA Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. and an interest-free loan of RMB200,000 for purposes of providing capital to Beijing SINA Infinity Advertising Co., Ltd. The entire principal amount of each of these loans is currently outstanding. Each of these loans was extended as replacement for loans previously extended to Mr. Chen by BSIT in the same principal amounts disclosed above and on the same terms as described below, except where noted, which loans were replaced by the STC loans due to BSIT being dissolved by the Company.  STC agreed to provide Hong Du, our Chief Operating Officer, an interest-free loan of RMB5,350,000 for purposes of providing capital to Beijing SINA Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. The entire principal amount of the loan is currently outstanding. The loan was extended as replacement for the loan previously extended to Ms. Du by BSIT in the same principal amount as disclosed above and on the same terms as described below, except where noted, which loans were replaced by the STC loans due to BSIT being dissolved by the Company.  The aforementioned capital investments in the VIEs are funded by SINA and recorded as interest-free loans to the PRC officers and employees. Such interest-free loans are extended solely for subscription of the shares of the VIEs, and the transfer of ownership of the shares in the VIEs, as directed by SINA, is the requisite form of repayment of such interest-free loans. These are not personal loans. Under various contractual agreements, employee shareholders of the VIEs are required to transfer their ownership in these entities to our subsidiaries in China when permitted by PRC laws and regulations or to our designees at any time, and all shareholders of the VIEs are obligated to waive their right of first refusal or any other rights that are restrictive on such requested transfer. In addition, our employee shareholders of the VIEs have pledged their shares in the VIEs (and all rights relating thereto) as collateral for non-payment of (i) the interest-free loans and (ii) fees on technical and other services due to us. Except as set forth above, employee shareholders of the VIEs are not otherwise permitted to transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber their ownership of VIEs without STCs written approval. All voting rights with respect to the shares of the VIEs are assigned to us. We have the power to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of the VIEs. Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, we have also entered into exclusive technical agreements and other service agreements with the VIEs, under which these subsidiaries provide technical services and other services to the VIEs in exchange for substantially all net income of the VIEs. In addition to the terms described above which were also applicable to the BSIT loans, STC has entered into a letter agreement with the PRC officers and employees that provides for (i) the cancellation of such officers and employees obligations under the contractual agreements upon the transfer or acquisition of shares held by such officers and employees and (ii) the indemnification of such officers and employees for any liability incurred in the course of discharging such officers and employees obligations under any of the contractual agreements. Employment and Compensation Agreements We have entered into employment and compensation arrangements with our directors and executive officers as described in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees above. Indemnification Agreements We have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors containing provisions which may require us, among other things, to indemnify our officers and directors against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as officers or directors, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature, and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified.
