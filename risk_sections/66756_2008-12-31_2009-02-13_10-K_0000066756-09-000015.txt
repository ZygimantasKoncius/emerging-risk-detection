Item 1A. Risk Factors Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements, including those contained in this Form 10-K, should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading: “Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995” located on page 5 of this Form 10-K and the factors described below. The risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer if the concerns set forth below are realized. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted if our Large Power Customers experience an economic down cycle or fail to compete effectively in the global economy. Our 12 Large Power Customers accounted for approximately 36 percent of our 2008 consolidated operating revenue (one of these customers accounted for 12.5 percent of consolidated revenue). These customers are involved in cyclical industries that by their nature are adversely impacted by economic downturns and are subject to strong competition in the global marketplace. An economic downturn or failure to compete effectively in the global economy could have a material adverse effect on their operations and, consequently, could negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to remarket this energy at similar prices. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We are subject to prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of the United States Congress, state legislatures, the FERC, the MPUC and the PSCW. These governmental regulations relate to allowed rates of return, financings, industry and rate structure, acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, operation and construction of plant facilities, recovery of purchased power and capital investments, and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition (including but not limited to transmission costs). These governmental regulations significantly influence our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from our customers. We are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the agencies that regulate our business. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain current rates of return depends upon regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot assure that rate adjustments will be obtained or current authorized rates of return on capital will be earned. Minnesota Power and SWL&P from time to time file rate cases with federal and state regulatory authorities. In future rate cases, if Minnesota Power and SWL&P do not receive an adequate amount of rate relief, rates are reduced, increased rates are not approved on a timely basis or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through rates, we may experience an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and operations results from future regulatory activities of any of these agencies. Our operations could be significantly impacted by initiatives designed to reduce the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as carbon dioxide from our generating facilities. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed within Minnesota, among a group of midwestern states that includes Minnesota, in the United States Congress and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels. We currently use coal as the primary fuel in 94 percent of the energy produced by our generating facilities. We cannot be certain whether new laws or regulations will be adopted to reduce GHGs and what affect any such laws or regulations would have on us. If any new laws or regulations are implemented, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if implementation costs are not fully recoverable from customers. We are participating in research and study initiatives to mitigate the potential impact of carbon emissions regulation to our business. There is no assurance that our current reduction efforts will mitigate the impact of any new regulations. The cost of environmental emission allowances could have a negative financial impact on our operations. Minnesota Power is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations which cap emissions and could require us to purchase environmental emissions allowances to be in compliance. The laws and regulations expose us to emission allowance price fluctuations which could increase our cost of operations. We are unable to predict emission allowance pricing or regulatory recovery of these costs. We are pursuing a current cost recovery mechanism with the MPUC. ALLETE 2008 Form 10-K 20 Risk Factors (Continued) Our operations pose certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air quality, water quality, waste management, reclamation and other environmental considerations. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs, as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations, particularly with regard to laws relating to power plant emissions. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot predict the financial or operational outcome of any related litigation that may arise. There are no assurances that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations, which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating such costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. The operation and maintenance of our generating facilities involve risks that could significantly increase the cost of doing business. The operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, the dependence on a specific fuel source, or the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, the occurrence of any of which could result in lost revenue, increased expenses or both. A significant portion of Minnesota Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago. In particular, older generating equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to keep operating at peak efficiency. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvements due to changing environmental standards and technological advances. Minnesota Power could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce power, including failure caused by breakdown or forced outage, as well as repairing damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events. Further, our ability to successfully and timely complete capital improvements to existing facilities or other capital projects is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful, we could be subject to additional costs and/or the write-off of our investment in the project or improvement. Our electrical generating operations must have adequate and reliable transmission and distribution facilities to deliver electricity to its customers. Minnesota Power depends on transmission and distribution facilities owned by other utilities, and transmission facilities primarily operated by MISO, as well as its own such facilities, to deliver the electricity we produce and sell to our customers, and to other energy suppliers. If transmission capacity is inadequate our ability to sell and deliver electricity may be hindered. We may have to forego sales or we may have to buy more expensive wholesale electricity that is available in the capacity-constrained area. In addition, any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact the satisfaction of our customers with our service. In our operations the price of electricity and fuel may be volatile. Volatility in market prices for electricity and fuel may result from: · severe or unexpected weather conditions; · seasonality; · changes in electricity usage; · transmission or transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies; · availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources; · changes in supply and demand for energy; · changes in power production capacity; · outages at Minnesota Power’s generating facilities or those of our competitors; · changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude oil and refined products; · natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events; and · federal, state, local and foreign energy, environmental, or other regulation and legislation. Since fluctuations in fuel expense related to our regulated utility operations are passed on to customers through our fuel clause, risk of volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity mainly impacts our non-rate base operations at this time. ALLETE 2008 Form 10-K 21 Risk Factors (Continued) We are dependent on good labor relations. We believe our relations to be good with our 1,529 employees. Failure to successfully renegotiate labor agreements could adversely affect the services we provide and our results of operations. 729 of our employees are members of either the IBEW Local 31 or Local 1593. The labor agreement with Local 31 at Minnesota Power and SWL&P expired on January 31, 2009. Both parties have agreed to extend the current agreement until a new agreement is signed. Negotiations are proceeding as anticipated and we remain optimistic of achieving a ratified agreement. The labor agreement with Local 1593 at BNI Coal expires on March 31, 2011. A downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our real estate business. The ability of our real estate business to generate revenue is directly related to the Florida real estate market, the national and local economy in general and changes in interest rates. While conditions in the Florida real estate market may fluctuate over time, continued demand for land is dependent on long-term prospects for strong, in-migration population expansion. Our real estate business is subject to extensive regulation through Florida laws regulating planning and land development which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations. Development of real property in Florida entails an extensive approval process involving overlapping regulatory jurisdictions. Real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (Growth Management Act). In addition, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive DRI application. The Growth Management Act, in some instances, can significantly affect the ability of developers to obtain local government approval in Florida. In many areas, infrastructure funding has not kept pace with growth. As a result, substandard facilities and services can delay or prevent the issuance of permits. Consequently, the Growth Management Act could adversely affect the cost and our ability to develop future real estate projects. Changes in the Growth Management Act or DRI review process or the enactment of new laws regarding the development of real property could adversely affect our ability to develop future real estate projects. Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of pension and postretirement health benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding and increase annual expense. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations to these plans and the Company holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. If we are not able to retain our executive officers and key employees, we may not be able to implement our business strategy and our business could suffer. The success of our business heavily depends on the leadership of our executive officers, all of whom are employees-at-will and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete. If we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. We may have difficulty in retaining and attracting customers, developing new services, negotiating favorable agreements with customers and providing acceptable levels of customer service. We rely on access to financing sources and capital markets. If we do not have access to sufficient capital in the amount and at the times needed, our ability to execute our business plans, make capital expenditures or pursue acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth could be impaired. We rely on access to capital markets as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flow from operations. If we are not able to access capital on satisfactory terms, the ability to implement our business plans may be adversely affected. Market disruptions or a downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access financial markets. Such disruptions could include a severe prolonged economic downturn, the bankruptcy of non-affiliated industry leaders in the same line of business or financial services sector, deterioration in capital market conditions, volatility in commodity prices or events such as those currently being experienced in the United States and abroad.
