Item 1A. Risk Factors Significant factors that could impact the Companys business operations include, without limitation, the following: Availability or retention of retail space. In those countries where the Company maintains leadership in the gum segment, the Companys ability to retain preferred retail space allocation will impact results. If the Company is not able to retain this allocation, the Companys results could be negatively impacted. Availability of raw materials. The Company uses many raw materials to manufacture chewing gum and other confectionery products including sugar, corn syrup, flavoring oils, polyols and high intensity sweeteners. While these products are generally readily available on the open market, if the Company is unable to maintain the availability, pricing and sourcing of these raw materials, the Companys results could be negatively impacted. Changes in demographics and consumer preference. The Company operates in an increasingly competitive industry. As such, the Companys continued success is dependent upon its ability to continue to create and market products which appeal to diverse consumers. Failure to adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics and product preferences, the failure of new or existing products to be favorably received or the Companys inability to otherwise adapt to changing customer and consumer needs could result in increased capital, marketing or other expenditures or may result in a decrease in category share growth, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results. Changes in foreign currency and marketplace conditions. Manufacturing and sales of a significant portion of the Companys products are outside the United States. The majority of countries in which the Company operates tend to be politically, socially and economically stable. To the extent there is political or social unrest, civil war, terrorism or significant economic instability, the results of the Companys business in such countries could be negatively impacted. In addition, given the global nature of our business, we earn revenue, pay expenses, incur liabilities and hold assets in a variety of foreign currencies which we translate into U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes at the then-applicable exchange rate. Consequently, volatility in foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. Increased competition, discounting and other competitive actions. The Company competes worldwide with other well-established manufacturers of confectionery products, including chewing gum. In addition, the Companys results may be negatively impacted by ineffective advertising, or by our failure to sufficiently counter aggressive competitive actions. In addition, discounting and other competitive actions may also make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its operating margins. Underutilization of or inadequate manufacturing capacity. Unanticipated movements in consumer demands could result in inadequate manufacturing capacity or underutilization of the Companys manufacturing capacity, which could negatively impact manufacturing efficiencies and costs. 4 Governmental regulations. Government regulations with respect to import duties, tariffs, taxes and environmental controls, both in and outside the United States, could negatively impact the Companys costs and ability to compete in domestic or foreign marketplaces. Labor stoppages. To the extent the Company experiences any material labor stoppages, such disputes or strikes could negatively affect shipments from suppliers or shipments of finished product. Outcome of integrating acquired businesses. The Companys inability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results or expectations of the business.
