ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued Conflicts of Interest. Existing and future officers and directors may have other interests to which they devote time, either individually or through partnerships and corporations in which they have an interest, hold an office, or serve on boards of directors, and each may continue to do so. As a result, certain conflicts of interest may exist between the Company and its officers and/or directors that may not be susceptible to resolution. All potential conflicts of interest will be resolved only through exercise by the directors of such judgment as is consistent with their fiduciary duties to the Company and it is the intention of management to minimize any potential conflicts of interest. Voting Control. As a result of the acquisition of SO Entertainment, certain persons, either individually or acting together, are able to elect a majority of Directors or to authorize or defeat any proposal presented to the stockholders for action.
