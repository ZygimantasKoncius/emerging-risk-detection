Risk Factors. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in certain of our other filings with the SEC, the following risks and uncertainties, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by us or by any forward-looking statement contained herein. Prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings. We have many business risks including those related to our financial performance, investments in our common stock, operating our business and legal matters. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or focused on may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be profitable. As measured under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), we have incurred a net loss in each of the last five fiscal years. We incurred a net loss of $355.0 million in fiscal 2009, $11.9 million in fiscal 2008 and $21.8 million in fiscal 2007. We can give no assurance that we will be consistently profitable, if at all. The effects of the recession in the United States and general downturn in the global economy, including financial market disruptions, could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. The United States economy is in recession and there has been a general downturn in the global economy. A continuation or worsening of these conditions, including the ongoing credit and capital markets disruptions, could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For example:  We may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers and prospective customers. During the last quarter, some customers advised us of their intention to slow deployments to conserve cash. Such customer attitudes could continue to affect out business, financial condition and cash flows adversely.  We may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors.  We may incur increased costs or experience difficulty either in making future borrowings under our credit facility or otherwise in obtaining financing for our operating activities, investing activities (including the financing of any future acquisitions) or financing activities. Credit and commercial risks and exposures could increase if the financial condition of our customers declines. A substantial portion of our sales are to customers in the telecommunications industry. These customers may require their suppliers to provide extended payment terms, direct loans or other forms of financial support as a condition to obtaining commercial contracts. We expect that we may provide or commit to financing where appropriate for our business. Our ability to arrange or provide financing for our customers will depend on a number of factors, including our credit rating, our level of available credit and our ability to sell off commitments on acceptable terms. More generally, we expect to routinely enter into long-term contracts involving significant 18 Table of Contents amounts to be paid by our customers over time. Pursuant to these contracts, we may deliver products and services representing an important portion of the contract price before receiving any significant payment from the customer. As a result of the financing that may be provided to customers and our commercial risk exposure under long-term contracts, our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes. Over the past few years, certain of our customers have filed with the courts seeking protection under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of the applicable jurisdiction, or have experienced financial difficulties. As a result of the more challenging economic environment, we saw some increase in the number of our customers experiencing such difficulties in 2008, and we expect that trend to intensify if global economy deteriorates further in 2009. That trend may be exacerbated in many emerging markets, where our customers are being affected not only by recession, but by deteriorating local currencies and a lack of credit. Upon the financial failure of a customer, we may experience losses on credit extended and loans made to such customer, losses relating to our commercial risk exposure and the loss of the customers ongoing business. If customers fail to meet their obligations to us, we may experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of reserves, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Our customers may not pay for products and services in a timely manner, or at all, which would decrease our cash flows and adversely affect our working capital. Our business requires extensive credit risk management that may not be adequate to protect against customer nonpayment. A risk of non-payment by customers is a significant focus of our business. We expect a significant amount of future revenue to come from international customers, many of whom will be startup telecom operators in developing countries. We do not generally expect to obtain collateral for sales, although we require letters of credit or credit insurance as appropriate for international customers. For information regarding the percentage of revenue attributable to certain key customers, see the risks discussed in the factor below titled Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business. Our historical accounts receivable balances have been concentrated in a small number of significant customers. Unexpected adverse events impacting the financial condition of our customers, bank failures or other unfavorable regulatory, economic or political events in the countries in which we do business may impact collections and adversely impact our business, require increased bad debt expense or receivable write-offs and adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and operating results. Part of our inventory may be written off, which would increase our cost of revenues. In addition, we may be exposed to inventory-related losses on inventories purchased by our contract manufacturers. In fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $29.8 million for product transition and $3.4 for purchase obligations from contract manufacturers. In fiscal 2008, we recorded charges of $14.7 million for inventory impairment charges resulting from post-merger product transitioning and product end-of-life events. Inventory of raw materials, work in-process or finished products may accumulate in the future, and we may encounter losses due to a variety of factors, including:  Rapid technological change in the wireless telecommunications industry resulting in frequent product changes;  The need of our contract manufacturers to order raw materials that have long lead times and our inability to estimate exact amounts and types of items thus needed, especially with regard to the frequencies in which the final products ordered will operate; and  Cost reduction initiatives resulting in component changes within the products. Further, our inventory of finished products may accumulate as the result of cancellation of customer orders or our customers refusal to confirm the acceptance of our products. Our contract manufacturers are required to purchase inventory based on manufacturing projections we provide to them. If our actual orders from our customers are lower than these manufacturing projections, our contract manufacturers will have excess inventory of raw materials or finished products which we would be required to purchase. In addition, we require our contract manufacturers from time to time to purchase more inventory than is immediately required, and to partially assemble 19 Table of Contents components, in order to shorten our delivery time in case of an increase in demand for our products. In the absence of such increase in demand, we may need to compensate our contract manufacturers. If we are required to purchase excess inventory from our contract manufacturers or otherwise compensate our contract manufacturers for purchasing excess inventory, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We also may purchase components or raw materials from time to time for use by our contract manufacturers in the manufacturing of our products. These purchases are based on our own manufacturing projections. If our actual orders are lower than these manufacturing projections, we may accumulate excess inventory which we may be required to write-off. If we are forced to write-off this inventory other than in the normal course of business, our business, financial condition, results of operations could be materially affected adversely. We may undertake further restructurings which may adversely impact our operations, and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future restructurings. We continue to restructure and transform our business to realign resources and achieve desired cost savings in an increasingly competitive market. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we undertook restructuring activities implemented within the merger restructuring plans approved in connection with the January 26, 2007 merger between the Microwave Communications Division of Harris Corporation and Stratex Networks, Inc. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced a new restructuring plan (the Fiscal 2009 Plan) to reduce our worldwide workforce. These restructuring plans included the consolidation of facilities and operations of the predecessor entities in Canada, France, the U.S., China, Brazil and, to a lesser extent, Mexico, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. If we consolidate additional facilities in the future, we may incur additional restructuring and related expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have based our restructuring efforts on assumptions and plans regarding the appropriate cost structure of our businesses based on our product mix and projected sales among other factors. These assumptions may not be correct and we may not be able to operate in accordance with our plans. Should this occur we may determine that we must incur additional restructuring charges in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will realize all of the anticipated benefits of the restructurings or that we will not further reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce or exit, or dispose of, certain businesses and protect lines. Any decision by management to further limit investment, exit, or dispose of businesses may result in the recording of additional restructuring charges. As a result, the costs actually incurred in connection with the restructuring efforts may be higher than originally planned and may not lead to the anticipated cost savings and/or improved results. Our average sales prices may decline in the future. Currently, manufacturers of digital microwave telecommunications equipment are experiencing, and are likely to continue to experience, declining sales prices. This price pressure is likely to result in downward pricing pressure on our products and services. As a result, we are likely to experience declining average sales prices for our products. Our future profitability will depend upon our ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies, reduce costs of materials used in our products, and to continue to introduce new lower-cost products and product enhancements. If we are unable to respond to increased price competition, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Because customers frequently negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates, we may be required to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how, or if, cost reductions can be obtained. As a result, current or future price reduction commitments and any inability on our part to respond to increased price competition, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may experience additional impairment charges for our intangible assets or goodwill. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $279.0 million to write-off all of our goodwill prior to the acquisition of Telsima and $32.6 million for a majority of our Stratex trade name indefinite lived-asset. As a result, the remaining value of the Stratex trade name was $0.4 million as of July 3, 2009 and it has a useful life of six months. As of July 3, 2009, the net carrying value of our total definite-lived intangible assets, and recently acquired goodwill from the Telsima acquisition totaled approximately $84.1 million and $3.2 million. 20 Table of Contents Our intangible assets are subject to impairment testing in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets and our goodwill is subject to an impairment test in accordance with Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We review the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including a lack of recovery in the market price of our common stock or the fair value of our debt, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the intangible assets, and mergers and acquisitions could result in the need to reassess the fair value of our assets and liabilities which could lead to an impairment charge for any of our definite-lived intangible assets or goodwill. An impairment charge related to our intangible assets or goodwill could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which it is incurred. Our effective tax rate could be highly volatile and could adversely affect our operating results. Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:  The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;  Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;  Increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;  Changes in available tax credits;  Changes in share-based compensation expense;  Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;  Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and  The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.  The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could impact our results of operations for future periods adversely. Termination of our transitional services agreements with Harris before we have established our own fully independent administrative and other support functions could impair our ability to operate our business effectively and materially increase our general and administrative expenses. On January 26, 2007, we completed our merger with Stratex Networks, Inc. Prior to the merger, we were a division of Harris Corporation and we relied on administrative and other resources of Harris to operate our business. In connection with the merger, we entered into a transition services agreement with Harris to retain the ability to use these Harris resources at our option, some for a specified term, which pursuant to an amendment in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, will expire September 30, 2010. Pursuant to the transition services agreement, Harris provides us with database management, supply chain systems, sales and service, financial systems, HR systems, internal and information systems shared services support, network management and help desk support, and server administration and support, and charges us for these services at a stipulated rate based on our actual usage. This agreement can be terminated by either party upon 90 days prior written notice. We must be able to replace these services prior to termination of the transition services agreement. It is likely that replacing these services will require new capital expenditures and that our costs for these services may increase once we are no longer receiving these services from Harris under the current agreement. This could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows going forward. 21 Table of Contents Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business. Sales of our products and services historically have been concentrated in a small number of customers. Principal customers for our products and services include domestic and international wireless/mobile service providers, original equipment manufacturers, as well as private network users such as public safety agencies; government institutions; and utility, pipeline, railroad and other industrial enterprises that operate broadband wireless networks. We had revenue from a single external customer that exceeded 10% of our total revenue during fiscal 2009 and 2008, but not during fiscal 2007. Although we have a large customer base, during any given quarter, a small number of customers may account for a significant portion of our revenue. It is possible that a significant portion of our future product sales also could be concentrated in a limited number of customers. In addition, product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period. The loss of any existing customer, a significant reduction in the level of sales to any existing customer, or our inability to gain additional customers could result in declines in our revenue or an inability to grow revenue. In addition, consolidation of our potential customer base could result in purchasing decision delays as consolidating customers integrate their operations and could generally reduce our opportunities to win new customers to the extent that the number of potential customers decreases. Furthermore, as our customers become larger, they may have more leverage to negotiate better pricing which could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins. We will face strong competition for maintaining and improving our position in the market, which could adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results. The wireless interconnection and access business is a specialized segment of the wireless telecommunications industry and is extremely competitive. We expect competition in this segment to increase. Some of our competitors have more extensive engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities and significantly greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, some of our competitors have greater name recognition, broader product lines, a larger installed base of products and longer-standing customer relationships. Our competitors include established companies, such as Alcatel-Lucent, Eltek ASA, Ericsson, NEC and Nokia Siemens Networks, as well as a number of other public and private companies such as Ceragon and Huawei Technologies in selected markets. Some of our competitors are original equipment manufacturers or systems integrators through whom we market and sell our products, which means our business success may depend on these competitors to some extent. One or more of our largest customers could internally develop the capability to manufacture products similar to those manufactured or outsourced by us and, as a result, the demand for our products and services may decrease. In addition, we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with many entities that have substantially greater resources than we have. Our competitors may enter into business combinations in order to accelerate product development or to compete more aggressively and we may lack the resources to meet such enhanced competitions. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including price, quality, availability, customer service and support, breadth of product line, product performance and features, rapid time-to-market delivery capabilities, reliability, timing of new product introductions by us, our customers and competitors, the ability of our customers to obtain financing and the stability of regional sociopolitical and geopolitical circumstances, and the ability of large competitors to obtain business by providing more seller financing especially for large transactions. We can give no assurances that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise, or marketing, sales, distribution, customer service and support capabilities to compete successfully, or that regional sociopolitical and geographic circumstances will be favorable for our successful operation. Consolidation within the telecommunications industry could result in a decrease in our revenue. The telecommunications industry has experienced significant consolidation among its participants, and we expect this trend to continue. Some operators in this industry have experienced financial difficulty and have filed, or may file, for bankruptcy protection. Other operators may merge and one or more of our competitors may supply products to the customers of the combined company following those mergers. This consolidation could result in 22 Table of Contents purchasing decision delays and decreased opportunities for us to supply products to companies following any consolidation. This consolidation may also result in lost opportunities for cost reduction and economies of scale. In addition, see the risks discussed in the factor above titled Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business. If we fail to develop and maintain distribution and licensing relationships, our revenue may decrease. Although a majority of our sales are made through our direct sales force, we also will market our products through indirect sales channels such as independent agents, distributors, OEMs and systems integrators. These relationships enhance our ability to pursue major contract awards and, in some cases, are intended to provide our customers with easier access to financing and a greater variety of equipment and service capabilities, which an integrated system provider should be able to offer. We may not be able to maintain and develop additional relationships or, if additional relationships are developed, they may not be successful. Our inability to establish or maintain these distribution and licensing relationships could restrict our ability to market our products and thereby result in significant reductions in revenue. If these revenue reductions occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. Our success will depend on new product introductions, product transitioning and customer acceptance. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. Our future success will depend, in part, on continuous, timely development and introduction of new products and enhancements that address evolving market requirements and are attractive to customers. We believe that successful new product introductions provide a significant competitive advantage because of the significant resources committed by customers in adopting new products and their reluctance to change products after these resources have been expended. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources on internal research and development to support our effort to develop and introduce new products and enhancements. As we transition to common product platforms, we may face significant risk that current customers may not accept these new products. To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products that are adopted by customers, we could fail to obtain an adequate return on these investments and could lose market share to our competitors, which could be difficult or impossible to regain. In addition, we could incur significant costs in completing the transition. If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur additional costs which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements or forecast customer demand, we may incur additional costs of manufacturing and our gross margins and financial results could be adversely affected. If we overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may experience an oversupply of components and assess us charges for excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. If we underestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory or components, which could interrupt manufacturing and result in higher manufacturing costs, shipment delays, damage to customer relationships and/or our payment of penalties to our customers. Our contract manufacturers may also have other customers and may not have sufficient capacity to meet all of their customers needs, including ours, during periods of excess demand. If we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships, we could incur additional costs or be unable to timely fulfill our customer commitments, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations and, in the event of an inability to fulfill commitments, would harm our customer relationships. We outsource a substantial portion of our manufacturing and repair service operations to independent contract manufacturers and other third parties. Our contract manufacturers typically manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts of our product needs that we provide to them on a regular basis. The contract manufacturers are responsible for procuring components necessary to build our products based on our rolling forecasts, building and 23 Table of Contents assembling the products, testing the products in accordance with our specifications and then shipping the products to us. We configure the products to our customer requirements, conduct final testing and then ship the products to our customers. Although we currently partner with multiple major contract manufacturers, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter problems as we become increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers to provide these manufacturing services or that we will be able to replace a contract manufacturer that is not able to meet our demand. In addition, if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or other service providers, or if one or more of them should not fully comply with their contractual obligations or should experience delays, disruptions, component procurement problems or quality control problems, then our ability to ship products to our customers or otherwise fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers could be delayed or impaired which would adversely affect our business, financial results and customer relationships. Our industry is volatile and subject to frequent changes, and we may not be able to respond effectively or in a timely manner to these changes. We participate in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by vigorous competition for market share and rapid technological development. These factors could result in aggressive pricing practices and growing competition both from start-up companies and from well-capitalized telecommunication systems providers, which could decrease our revenue. In response to changes in our industry and market conditions, we may restructure our activities to more strategically realign our resources. This includes assessing whether we should consider disposing of, or otherwise exiting, certain businesses, and reviewing the recoverability of our tangible and intangible assets. Any decision to limit investment in our tangible and intangible assets or to dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of accrued liabilities for special charges, such as workforce reduction costs. Additionally, accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions, and could harm our results of operations. Rapid changes in the microwave radio industry and the frequent introduction of lower cost components for our product offerings may result in excess inventory that we cannot sell or may be required to sell at distressed prices, and may result in longer credit terms to our customers. The rapid changes and evolving industry standards that characterize the market for our products require frequent modification of products for us to be successful. These rapid changes could result in the accumulation of component inventory parts that become obsolete as modified products are introduced and adopted by customers. We have experienced significant inventory write-offs in recent years, and because of the rapid changes that characterize the market, we also may be forced to write down excess inventory from time to time. Moreover, these same factors may force us to significantly reduce prices for older products or extend more and longer credit terms to customers, which could negatively impact our cash and possibly result in higher bad debt expense. More generally, we cannot give assurances that we will be successful in matching our inventory purchases with anticipated shipment volumes. As a result, we may fail to control the amount of inventory on hand and may be forced to write off additional amounts. Such additional inventory write-offs, if required, would adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and operating results. If sufficient radio frequency spectrum is not allocated for use by our products, and we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products, our ability to market our products may be restricted. Radio communications are subject to regulation by U.S. and foreign laws and international treaties. Generally, our products need to conform to a variety of United States and international requirements established to avoid interference among users of transmission frequencies and to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment. Any delays in compliance with respect to our future products could delay the introduction of such products. In addition, we will be affected by the allocation and auction of the radio frequency spectrum by governmental authorities both in the U.S. and internationally. Such governmental authorities may not allocate sufficient radio frequency spectrum for use by our products or we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for our 24 Table of Contents products from these authorities. Historically, in many developed countries, the unavailability of frequency spectrum has inhibited the growth of wireless telecommunications networks. In addition, to operate in a jurisdiction, we must obtain regulatory approval for our products. Each jurisdiction in which we market our products has its own regulations governing radio communications. Products that support emerging wireless telecommunications services can be marketed in a jurisdiction only if permitted by suitable frequency allocations, auctions and regulations. The process of establishing new regulations is complex and lengthy. If we are unable to obtain sufficient allocation of radio frequency spectrum by the appropriate governmental authority or obtain the proper regulatory approval for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. Due to the significant volume of international sales we expect, we may be susceptible to a number of political, economic and geographic risks that could harm our business. We are highly dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. In fiscal 2009, our sales to international customers accounted for 69% of total revenue. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, sales to international customers accounted for 73% and 67% of our revenue, respectively. Also, significant portions of our international sales are in less developed countries. Our international sales are likely to continue to account for a large percentage of our products and services revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, the occurrence of any international, political, economic or geographic event that adversely affects our business could result in a significant decline in revenue. Some of the risks and challenges of doing business internationally include:  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;  management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries;  the burden of complying with a variety of laws and regulations in various countries;  application of the income tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, including relatively low-rate and relatively high-rate jurisdictions, to our sales and other transactions, which results in additional complexity and uncertainty;  general economic and geopolitical conditions, including inflation and trade relationships;  war and acts of terrorism;  natural disasters;  currency exchange controls; and  changes in export regulations. While these factors and the impacts of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. Our products are used in critical communications networks which may subject us to significant liability claims. Since our products are used in critical communications networks, we may be subject to significant liability claims if our products do not work properly. The provisions in our agreements with customers that are intended to limit our exposure to liability claims may not preclude all potential claims. In addition, any insurance policies we have may not adequately limit our exposure with respect to such claims. We warrant to our current customers that our products will operate in accordance with our product specifications. If our products fail to conform to these specifications, our customers could require us to remedy the failure or could assert claims for damages. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Any such claims, whether or not successful, would be costly and time-consuming to defend, and could divert managements attention and seriously damage our reputation and our business. 25 Table of Contents If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may be deprived of legal recourse against those who misappropriate our intellectual property. Our ability to compete will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology in the U.S. and internationally. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents and contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, and enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot give assurances that any steps taken by us will be adequate to deter misappropriation or impede independent third-party development of similar technologies. In the event that such intellectual property arrangements are insufficient, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. We have significant operations in the U.S., United Kingdom, Singapore and New Zealand, and outsourcing arrangements in Asia. We cannot provide assurances that the protection provided to our intellectual property by the laws and courts of particular nations will be substantially similar to the protection and remedies available under U.S. law. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurances that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us based on intellectual property rights and laws in other nations that are different from those established in the U.S. We may be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property associated with our wireless business; this litigation could be costly to defend and resolve, and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology. The wireless telecommunications industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in often protracted and expensive litigation. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Such litigation or claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the use and transfer of allegedly infringing technology or the sale of allegedly infringing products and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses for the infringing technology. We can give no assurances that we would be successful in developing such non-infringing technology or that any license for the infringing technology would be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, competitive position and prospects. Our stock price may be volatile, which may lead to losses by investors. Announcements of developments related to our business, announcements by competitors, quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and general conditions in the telecommunications industry in which we compete, or the economies of the countries in which we do business and other factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These factors and fluctuations could lower the market price of our common stock. Our stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. The unpredictability of our quarter-to-quarter results may harm the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. Our quarterly operating results may vary significantly for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control. These factors could harm our business and include, among others:  volume and timing of our product orders received and delivered during the quarter;  our ability and the ability of our key suppliers to respond to changes on demand as needed;  our suppliers inability to perform and deliver on time as a result of their financial condition, component shortages or other supply chain constraints; 26 Table of Contents  our sales cycles can be lengthy;  continued market expansion through strategic alliances;  continued timely rollout of new product functionality and features;  increased competition resulting in downward pressures on the price of our products and services;  unexpected delays in the schedule for shipments of existing products and new generations of the existing platforms;  failure to realize expected cost improvement throughout our supply chain;  order cancellations or postponements in product deliveries resulting in delayed revenue recognition;  seasonality in the purchasing habits of our customers;  war and acts of terrorism;  natural disasters;  the ability of our customers to obtain financing to enable their purchase of our products;  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;  regulatory developments including denial of export and import licenses; and  general economic conditions worldwide. Our quarterly results are expected to be difficult to predict and delays in product delivery or closing a sale can cause revenue and net income or loss to fluctuate significantly from anticipated levels. In addition, we may increase spending in response to competition or in pursuit of new market opportunities. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to achieve profitability in the future or that if profitability is attained, that we will be able to sustain profitability, particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholders rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult. Because we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, which prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also contain certain provisions that may make a third-party acquisition of us difficult, including the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock and the requirement that nominations for directors and other proposals by stockholders must be made in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected or the proposals are voted upon. On April 20, 2009, we adopted a stockholders rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis. The rights plan has the potential effect of significantly diluting the ownership interest in us of any person that acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock or commences or announces its intent to commence a tender offer that would result in a person or group owning 15% or more of our common stock. The rights plan is due to expire on January 20, 2010. These provisions, as well as Section 203, may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market price, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interests. We may face risks related to pending litigation over the restatement of our financial statements. In connection with our identification of the material weaknesses in internal control described in our fiscal 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 25, 2008, we have had to restate our interim consolidated financial statements for the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal 2008 (the 27 Table of Contents quarters ended March 28, 2008, December 28, 2007 and September 28, 2007) and our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005 in order to correct errors contained in those financial statements. We also announced on July 30, 2008 that investors should no longer rely on our previously issued financial statements for those periods. We and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors were named in a federal securities class action complaint filed on September 15, 2008 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by plaintiff Norfolk County Retirement System on behalf of an alleged class of purchasers of our securities from January 29, 2007 to July 30, 2008, including shareholders of Stratex Networks, Inc. who exchanged shares of Stratex Networks, Inc. for our shares as part of the merger between Stratex Networks and the Microwave Communications Division of Harris Corporation. This action relates to the restatement of our prior financial statements as discussed in our fiscal 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 25, 2008. Similar complaints were filed in the United States District Court of Delaware on October 6 and October 30, 2008. Each complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and seeks, among other relief, determinations that the action is a proper class action, unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys fees and costs. The actions were consolidated on June 5, 2009 and a consolidated class action complaint was filed on July 29, 2009. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
