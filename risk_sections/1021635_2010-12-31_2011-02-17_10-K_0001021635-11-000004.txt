Item 1A. Risk Factors. In the discussion of risk factors set forth below, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “OGE Energy,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to OGE Energy Corp., “OG&E” refers to our subsidiary Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company and 26 “Enogex” refers to our subsidiary OGE Enogex Holdings and its subsidiaries. In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K and other documents filed by us and/or our subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating OGE Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us or our subsidiaries. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business operations. REGULATORY RISKS Our profitability depends to a large extent on the ability of OG&E to fully recover its costs from its customers and there may be changes in the regulatory environment that impair its ability to recover costs from its customers. We are subject to comprehensive regulation by several Federal and state utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences our operating environment and OG&E’s ability to fully recover its costs from utility customers. With rising fuel costs, recoverability of under recovered amounts from our customers is a significant risk. The utility commissions in the states where OG&E operates regulate many aspects of our utility operations including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers. The profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to fully recover costs related to providing energy and utility services to our customers. In recent years, the regulatory environments in which we operate have received an increased amount of public attention. It is possible that there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair our ability to fully recover costs historically absorbed by our customers. State utility commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. We cannot assure that the OCC, APSC and the FERC will grant us rate increases in the future or in the amounts we request, and they could instead lower our rates. We are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of the agencies that regulate us. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. OG&E’s rates are subject to rate regulation by the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as by a Federal agency, whose regulatory paradigms and goals may not be consistent. OG&E is currently a vertically integrated electric utility and most of its revenue results from the sale of electricity to retail customers subject to bundled rates that are approved by the applicable state utility commission and from the sale of electricity to wholesale customers subject to rates and other matters approved by the FERC. OG&E operates in Oklahoma and western Arkansas and is subject to rate regulation by the OCC and the APSC, in addition to the FERC. Exposure to inconsistent state and Federal regulatory standards may limit our ability to operate profitably. Further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate may harm our financial position and results of operations. Costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations, consolidated financial position, or liquidity. We are subject to extensive Federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels required for the production of electricity and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future. For example, the EPA has proposed lowering the ambient standards for ozone and SO2. If these standards are adopted, reductions in emissions from OG&E’s electric generating facilities could be required, which may result in significant capital and operating expenditures. There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our operations due to our handling of natural gas, air emissions related to our operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. For example, an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. 27 There also is growing concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the contribution of emissions of greenhouse gases including, most significantly, carbon dioxide. This concern has led to increased interest in legislation and regulation at the Federal level, actions at the state level, litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions and pressure for greenhouse gas emission reductions from investor organizations and the international community. OG&E reports quarterly its carbon dioxide emissions from its generating stations under the EPA’s acid rain program and is continuing to evaluate various options for reducing, avoiding, offsetting or sequestering its carbon dioxide emissions. Additional reporting is required by a rule issued by the EPA in 2009, and the EPA has proposed rules that could regulate carbon dioxide emissions under the Federal Clean Air Act. For a further discussion of environmental matters that may affect the Company, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Environmental Laws and Regulations” and “Environmental Laws and Regulations” in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If legislation or regulations are passed at the Federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on facilities to address climate change, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change could include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. OG&E’s operations are not sensitive to potential future sea-level rise as it does not operate in coastal areas. However, OG&E’s power delivery systems are vulnerable to damage from extreme weather events, such as ice storms, tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. These types of extreme weather events are common on OG&E’s system, so OG&E includes storm restoration in its budgeting process as a normal business expense. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase OG&E’s cost of providing service. OG&E’s electric generating facilities are designed to withstand the effects of extreme weather events, however, extreme weather conditions increase the stress placed on such systems. If climate change results in temperature increases in OG&E’s service territory, OG&E could expect increased electricity demand due to the increase in temperature and longer warm seasons. While this increase in demand could lead to increased energy consumption, it could also create a physical strain on OG&E’s generating resources. At the same time, OG&E could face restrictions on the ability to meet that demand if, due to drought severity, there is a lack of sufficient water for use in cooling during the electricity generating process. In addition to the above cited risks, to the extent that any climate change adversely affects the national or regional economic health through increased rates caused by the inclusion of additional regulatory imposed costs (carbon dioxide taxes or costs associated with additional regulatory requirements), the Company may be adversely impacted. A declining economy could adversely impact the overall financial health of the Company because of lack of load growth and decreased sales opportunities. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions. We may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. Our business plan for OG&E calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits and modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives. Significant portions of OG&E’s facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements or to provide reliable operations. OG&E currently provides service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge, we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment. This could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. While we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment, there can no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts, particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments. Many of our jurisdictions have fuel clauses that permit us to recover fuel costs through rates without a general rate case. While prudent capital investment and variable fuel costs each generally warrant recovery, in practical terms our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates. Any such limitation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The construction by Enogex of additions or modifications to its existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond Enogex’s control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. These projects, once undertaken, may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, Enogex’s revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of 28 funds on a particular project. For instance, if Enogex expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enogex may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enogex may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. Since Enogex is not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas, Enogex often does not have access to third-party estimates of potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enogex relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect Enogex’s results of operations, consolidated financial position and cash flows. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and Enogex may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Enogex’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. OG&E may not realize the expected benefits of its Smart Grid metering system, the Smart Grid metering system may not perform as intended or OG&E may incur costs to deploy the Smart Grid metering system that are not recoverable in rates which could adversely affect our results of operations, consolidated financial position and cash flows. During 2010, OG&E began implementing its Smart Grid metering infrastructure project for residential and commercial customers. This project, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2012, involves the installation of approximately 792,000 Smart Grid meters throughout OG&E’s service territory. Smart Grid meters will allow customer usage data to be transmitted through a communication network to a central collection point, where the data will be stored and used for customer billing and other commercial purposes. OG&E’s total project costs eligible for recovery (those costs expended or accrued by OG&E prior to the termination of the period authorized by the DOE as eligible for grant funds) shall be capped at $366.4 million, inclusive of the DOE grant award amount. The Smart Grid project cost includes the cost of implementing the Norman, Oklahoma smart grid pilot program previously authorized by the OCC. To the extent that OG&E’s total expenditure for system-wide deployment of smart grid technology during the eligible period exceeds the Smart Grid project cost, OG&E shall be entitled to offer evidence and seek to establish that the excess above the Smart Grid project cost was prudently incurred and any such contention may be addressed in OG&E’s 2013 rate case. If OG&E does not recognize the expected benefits of its Smart Grid metering system, if OG&E incurs additional Smart Grid metering costs that the OCC does not find reasonable or are unrecoverable or if OG&E cannot integrate the Smart Grid metering system with its customer billing and other computer information systems, this may adversely affect our results of operations, consolidated financial position and cash flows. The regional power market in which OG&E operates has changing transmission regulatory structures, which may affect the transmission assets and related revenues and expenses. OG&E currently owns and operates transmission and generation facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. OG&E is a member of the SPP regional transmission organization and has transferred operational authority (but not ownership) of OG&E’s transmission facilities to the SPP regional transmission organization. The SPP regional transmission organization implemented a regional energy imbalance service market on February 1, 2007. OG&E has participated, and continues to participate, in the SPP energy imbalance service market to aid in the optimization of its physical assets to serve OG&E’s customers. OG&E has not participated in the SPP energy imbalance service market for any speculative trading activities. The SPP purchases and sales are not allocated to individual customers. OG&E records the hourly sales to the SPP at market rates in Operating Revenues and the hourly purchases from the SPP at market rates in Cost of Goods Sold in its Consolidated Financial Statements. OG&E’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities may be adversely affected by changes in the organization, operation and regulation by the FERC or the SPP regional transmission organization. Increased competition resulting from restructuring efforts could have a significant financial impact on us and OG&E and consequently decrease our revenue. We have been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility and energy industries. Significant changes already have occurred and additional changes have been proposed to the wholesale electric market. Although retail restructuring efforts in Oklahoma and Arkansas have been postponed for the time being, if such efforts were renewed, retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant financial impact on us due to possible impairments of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins and/or increased costs of capital. Any such restructuring could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot predict when we will 29 be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can we predict the impact of these changes on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Investment Agreement with the ArcLight affiliate involves risks and uncertainties. In November 2010, the ArcLight affiliate acquired an indirect 9.9 percent interest in Enogex LLC and OGE Energy retained a 90.1 percent interest in Enogex LLC. Initially, we are entitled to designate three directors and the ArcLight group is able to designate one director of Enogex Holdings. The Investment Agreement provides the ArcLight group the opportunity to increase its ownership interest by providing equity funding for capital expenditures associated with Enogex’s business plan. As its ownership position increases, the ArcLight group will be entitled to increasing board representation. As of February 1, 2011, the ArcLight group has a 13.3 percent membership interest in Enogex Holdings. The ArcLight group will also be entitled, at various ownership thresholds, to certain special board approval rights with respect to certain significant actions taken by Enogex Holdings. Joint venture arrangements like this involve risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the joint venture partner failing to satisfy its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for commitments; the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and expected benefits of the business arrangement and the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partner and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts. A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enogex’s assets by Federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase. Enogex’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, but the FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking and capacity release and its promotion of market centers, may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has aggressively pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure that the FERC will continue to pursue these same objectives as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Enogex’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to regulation by the FERC pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA, which could have an adverse impact on its ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow it to recover the full cost of operating its transportation and storage facilities, including a reasonable return, and an adverse impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The FERC has jurisdiction over transportation rates charged by Enogex for transporting natural gas in interstate commerce under Section 311 of the NGPA. Rates to provide such service must be “fair and equitable” under the NGPA and are subject to review and approval by the FERC at least once every three years. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of Enogex’s FERC Section 311 proceedings. There can be no assurance that the FERC will approve Enogex’s requested rates. Enogex’s natural gas transportation, storage and gathering operations are subject to regulation by agencies in Oklahoma and Texas, and that regulation could have an adverse impact on its ability to establish rates that would allow it to recover the full cost of operating its facilities, including a reasonable return, and its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. State regulation of natural gas transportation, storage and gathering facilities generally focuses on various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory access requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enogex’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enogex’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered and, in some instances, adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enogex’s operations, but Enogex could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. Other state and local regulations also may affect Enogex’s business. Any such state regulation could have an adverse impact on Enogex’s business and its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 30 Enogex may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity programs and related repairs. Pursuant to the PSI Act, the DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for applicable pipelines. The regulations require operators to: Ÿ identify potential threats to the public or environment, including “high consequence areas” on covered pipeline segments where a leak or rupture could do the most harm; Ÿ develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; Ÿ gather data and identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a covered pipeline segment; Ÿ discover, evaluate and remediate problems in accordance with the program requirements; Ÿ continuously improve all elements of the integrity program; Ÿ continuously perform preventative and mitigation actions; Ÿ maintain a quality assurance process and management-of-change process; and Ÿ establish a communication plan that addresses safety concerns raised by the DOT and state agencies, including the periodic submission of performance documents to the DOT. During 2010, Enogex incurred $26.9 million of capital expenditures and operating costs for pipeline integrity management. Enogex currently estimates that it will incur capital expenditures and operating costs of between $100 million and $150 million from 2011 and 2015 in connection with pipeline integrity management. The estimated capital expenditures and operating costs include Enogex’s estimates for the assessment, remediation, prevention or other mitigation that may be determined to be necessary. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate costs of its integrity management program and compliance with this regulation because those costs will depend on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary. Enogex will continue to assess, remediate and maintain the integrity of its pipelines. The results of these activities could cause Enogex to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operations of its pipelines. Events that are beyond our control have increased the level of public and regulatory scrutiny of our industry. Governmental and market reactions to these events may have negative impacts on our business, consolidated financial position, cash flows and access to capital. As a result of accounting irregularities at public companies in general, and energy companies in particular, and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities, public companies, including those in the regulated and unregulated utility business, have been under an increased amount of public and regulatory scrutiny and suspicion. The accounting irregularities have caused regulators and legislators to review current accounting practices, financial disclosures and relationships between companies and their independent auditors. The capital markets and rating agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny. We believe that we are complying with all applicable laws and accounting standards, but it is difficult or impossible to predict or control what effect these types of events may have on our business, consolidated financial position, cash flows or access to the capital markets. It is unclear what additional laws or regulations may develop, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies, the energy industry or our operations specifically. Any new accounting standards could affect the way we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. These changes in accounting standards could lead to negative impacts on reported earnings or decreases in assets or increases in liabilities that could, in turn, affect our results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to substantial utility and energy regulation by governmental agencies. Compliance with current and future utility and energy regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certifications may result in significant costs to us. We are subject to substantial regulation from Federal, state and local regulatory agencies. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of our businesses, including customer rates, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices and the operation of generating facilities. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from future regulatory activities of these agencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave the FERC authority to establish mandatory electric reliability rules enforceable with significant monetary penalties. The FERC has approved the NERC as the Electric Reliability Organization for North America and delegated to it the development and enforcement of electric transmission reliability rules. It is the Company’s intent to comply with 31 all applicable reliability rules and expediently correct a violation should it occur. OG&E is subject to a NERC compliance audit every three years as well as periodic spot check audits and cannot predict the outcome of those audits. OPERATIONAL RISKS Our results of operations may be impacted by disruptions beyond our control. We are exposed to risks related to performance of contractual obligations by our suppliers. We are dependent on coal for much of our electric generating capacity. We rely on suppliers to deliver coal in accordance with short and long-term contracts. We have certain coal supply contracts in place; however, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to us under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. Coal delivery may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to various factors, including transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment. Failure or delay by our suppliers of coal deliveries could disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and require us to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of our customers. Also, because our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption or black-out caused by an event (severe storm, generator or transmission facility outage) on a neighboring system or the actions of a neighboring utility. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. OG&E’s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs. OG&E owns and operates coal-fired, natural gas-fired and wind-powered generating facilities. Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are: Ÿ Increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire; Ÿ Facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply; Ÿ Operator error or safety related stoppages; Ÿ Disruptions in the delivery of electricity; and Ÿ Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences. Economic conditions could negatively impact our business and our results of operations. Our operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. The consequences of a prolonged recession could include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also could affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital. Current economic conditions may be exacerbated by insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which could impact the ability of our customers to pay timely, increase customer bankruptcies, and could lead to increased bad debt. If such circumstances occur, we expect that commercial and industrial customers would be impacted first, with residential customers following. In addition, economic conditions, particularly budget shortfalls, could lead to increased pressure on Federal, state and local governments to raise additional funds, including through increased corporate taxes and/or through delaying, reducing or eliminating tax credits, grants or other incentives, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We are subject to information security risks. A security breach of our information systems could impact the reliability of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject us to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of operating or customer information. We cannot accurately assess the probability that a security breach may occur, despite the measures we have taken to prevent such a breach, and we are unable to quantify the potential impact of such an event. 32 Terrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The long-term impact of terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and the magnitude of the threat of future terrorist attacks on the electric utility and natural gas midstream industry in general, and on us in particular, cannot be known. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of supplies and markets for our products, and the possibility that our infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than existing insurance coverage. Enogex does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations. Enogex does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enogex obtains the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies sometimes for a specific period of time. A loss of these rights, through Enogex’s inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause Enogex to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere, reduce its revenue and impair its cash flows. Weather conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms, wind storms, as well as seasonal temperature variations may adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electric power. In OG&E’s service area, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce our revenues, net income, available cash and borrowing ability. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms and wind storms, may cause outages and property damage which may require us to incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers. The effect of the failure of our facilities to operate as planned, as described above, would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand period. Natural gas and NGLs prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could negatively affect Enogex’s results of operations and cash flows. Enogex’s results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas and NGLs depending on factors that are beyond our control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, liquefied natural gas and NGLs, actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Enogex’s keep-whole natural gas processing arrangements, which constituted 14 percent of its gross margin and accounted for 31 percent of its natural gas processed volumes during 2010, expose it to fluctuations in the pricing spreads between NGLs prices and natural gas prices. Keep-whole processing arrangements generally require a processor of natural gas to keep its shippers whole on a Btu basis by replacing the Btu’s of the NGLs extracted from the production stream with Btu’s of natural gas. Therefore, if natural gas prices increase and NGLs prices do not increase by a corresponding amount, the processor has to replace the Btu’s of natural gas at higher prices and processing margins are negatively affected. Enogex’s POP and POL natural gas processing agreements constituted eight percent of its gross margin and accounted for 40 percent of its natural gas processed volumes during 2010. Under these arrangements, Enogex generally gathers raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead, transports the gas through its gathering system, processes the gas and sells the processed gas and/or NGLs at prices based on published index prices. The price paid to producers is based on an agreed percentage of the proceeds of the sale of processed natural gas, NGLs or both or the expected proceeds based on an index price. Enogex refers to contracts in which it shares in specified percentages of the proceeds from the sale of natural gas and NGLs as POP arrangements and in which it receives proceeds from the sale of NGLs or the NGLs themselves as compensation for its processing services as POL arrangements. These arrangements expose Enogex to risks associated with the price of natural gas and NGLs. 33 At any given time, Enogex’s overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that Enogex was a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that Enogex was a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enogex’s margins could be negatively impacted to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas. Because of the natural decline in production from existing wells connected to Enogex’s systems, Enogex’s success depends on its ability to gather new sources of natural gas, which depends on certain factors beyond its control. Any decrease in supplies of natural gas could adversely affect Enogex’s business and results of operations and cash flows. Enogex’s gathering and transportation systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells, from which production will naturally decline over time. As a result, Enogex’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, Enogex must continually obtain new natural gas supplies. The primary factors affecting Enogex’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and attract new customers to its assets depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near these systems, Enogex’s ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and Enogex’s ability to expand capacity as needed. If Enogex is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing and transportation facilities would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and cash flows. Enogex’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling decisions of others. All of Enogex’s businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production. Enogex does not have control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of its operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. The primary factor that impacts drilling decisions is natural gas prices. Natural gas prices reached relatively high levels in mid-2008 due to the impact of rising demand for natural gas but have returned to the near $4.00 per MMBtu level due to a rapid decline in demand for natural gas. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the fields served by Enogex’s gathering, processing and transportation facilities, which would lead to reduced utilization of these assets. Other factors that impact production decisions include producers’ capital budgets, access to credit, the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits, costs of steel and other commodities, geological considerations, demand for hydrocarbons, the level of reserves, other production and development costs and regulatory changes. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by Enogex’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. The Company engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the impact of commodity price risk, which may have a volatile effect on its earnings and cash flows. The Company is exposed to changes in commodity prices in its operations. To minimize the risk of commodity prices, the Company may enter into physical forward sales or financial derivative contracts to hedge purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, contractual long/short obligations, keep-whole positions, POLs positions and inventories of natural gas. From time to time, Enogex has instituted a hedging program that was intended to reduce the commodity price risk associated with Enogex’s keep-whole and POLs arrangements. At December 31, 2010, Enogex had hedged a portion of its expected NGLs volumes attributable to these arrangements, along with the natural gas MMBtu equivalent for keep-whole volumes, for 2011. Management will continue to evaluate whether to enter into any new hedging arrangements and there can be no assurance that Enogex will enter into any new hedging arrangements. To the extent Enogex hedges its commodity price and interest rate exposures, Enogex may forego the benefits that otherwise would be experienced if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in Enogex’s favor. In addition, even though management monitors Enogex’s hedging activities, these activities can result in substantial losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement, the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective, or the hedging policies and procedures are not followed or do not work as planned. Enogex depends on certain key natural gas producer customers for a significant portion of its supply of natural gas and NGLs. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, any of these customers could result in a decline in its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Enogex relies on certain key natural gas producer customers for a significant portion of its natural gas and NGLs supply. During 2010, Chesapeake Energy Marketing Inc., Apache Corporation, Devon Energy Production Company L.P., BP America Production Company and Samson Resources Company accounted for 52.5 percent of Enogex’s natural gas and NGLs supply. The loss of the natural gas and NGLs volumes supplied by these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on Enogex’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 34 Enogex depends on two customers for a significant portion of its firm intrastate transportation and storage services. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, either of these customers could result in a decline in Enogex’s transportation and storage services and its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Enogex provides firm intrastate transportation and storage services to several customers on its system. Enogex’s major customers are OG&E and PSO, which is the second largest electric utility in Oklahoma and serves the Tulsa market. As part of the no-notice load following contract with OG&E, Enogex provides natural gas storage services for OG&E. Enogex provides gas transmission delivery services to all of PSO’s natural gas-fired electric generation facilities in Oklahoma under a firm intrastate transportation contract. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, revenues from Enogex’s firm intrastate transportation and storage contracts were $116.6 million, $116.8 million and $104.4 million, respectively, of which $47.5 million in each year was attributed to OG&E and $15.3 million in each year was attributed to PSO. Enogex’s current contract with PSO expires January 1, 2013, unless extended. The stated term of Enogex’s current contract with OG&E expired April 30, 2009, but the contract will remain in effect from year to year thereafter unless either party provides written notice of termination to the other party at least 180 days prior to the commencement of the next succeeding annual period. Because neither party provided notice of termination 180 days prior to May 1, 2011, the contract will remain in effect at least through April 30, 2012. The loss of all or even a portion of the intrastate transportation and storage services for either of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on Enogex’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enogex’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable, Enogex’s revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. Enogex depends upon third-party natural gas pipelines to deliver gas to, and take gas from, its transportation system. Enogex also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that it delivers to the third party at the tailgates of its processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. Since Enogex does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within Enogex’s control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable, Enogex’s revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. Enogex’s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Enogex competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. Some of these competitors are large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas and NGLs than Enogex. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enogex provides to its customers. In addition, Enogex’s customers who are significant producers of natural gas may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enogex’s. Enogex’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on Enogex’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, Enogex’s operations and financial results could be adversely affected. Gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas involves many hazards and operational risks, including: Ÿ damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism; Ÿ inadvertent damage from third parties, including construction, farm and utility equipment; Ÿ leaks of natural gas, NGLs and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas or NGLs as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; and Ÿ fires and explosions. These and other risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of Enogex’s related operations. Enogex’s insurance is currently provided under the Company’s insurance programs. Enogex is not fully insured against all risks inherent to its business. Enogex is not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, which may include toxic tort claims. In addition, Enogex may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount desired at reasonable rates. Moreover, in some instances, significant claims by the Company may limit or eliminate the amount of insurance 35 proceeds available to Enogex. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of the Company’s insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances, insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect Enogex’s operations and financial results. FINANCIAL RISKS Market performance, increased retirements, changes in retirement plan regulations and increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans and other employee-related benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. We have a Pension Plan that covers substantially all of our employees hired before December 1, 2009. We also have defined benefit postretirement plans that cover substantially all of our employees hired prior to February 1, 2000. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions with respect to the defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans have a significant impact on our earnings and funding requirements. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2010, we expect to continue to make future contributions to maintain required funding levels. It is our practice to also make voluntary contributions to maintain more prudent funding levels than minimally required. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. All employees hired prior to February 1, 2000 participate in defined benefit postretirement plans. If these employees retire when they become eligible for retirement over the next several years, or if our plan experiences adverse market returns on its investments, or if interest rates materially fall, our pension expense and contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels. The timing and number of employees retiring and selecting the lump-sum payment option could result in pension settlement charges that could materially affect our results of operations if we are unable to recover these costs through our electric rates. In addition, assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, have a significant impact on our results of operations and consolidated financial position. Those factors are outside of our control. In addition to the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements with our defined benefit retirement plan, health care plans and other employee benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, consolidated financial position, or liquidity. We face certain human resource risks associated with the availability of trained and qualified labor to meet our future staffing requirements. Workforce demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern to the electric utility and natural gas pipeline industry. The median age of utility and natural gas pipeline workers is significantly higher than the national average. Over the next three years, 31 percent of our current employees will be eligible to retire with full pension benefits. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. We are a holding company with our primary assets being investments in our subsidiaries. We are a holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our operating cash flow and our ability to pay our dividends and service our indebtedness depends upon the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends. At December 31, 2010, the Company and its subsidiaries had outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities of $5.3 billion. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our indebtedness or to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any statutory and contractual restrictions that may be applicable to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of working capital and other assets. Claims of creditors, including general creditors, of our subsidiaries on the assets of these subsidiaries will have priority over our claims generally (except to the extent that we may be a creditor of the subsidiaries and our claims are recognized) and claims by our shareowners. In addition, as discussed above, OG&E is regulated by state utility commissions in Oklahoma and Arkansas as well as a Federal regulatory agency which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. To the extent that the state commissions or Federal regulatory agency attempt to impose restrictions on the ability of OG&E to pay dividends to us, it could adversely affect our ability to continue to pay dividends. 36 Certain provisions in our charter documents have anti-takeover effects. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the Oklahoma corporations statute, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. Such provisions, including those regulating the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders’ meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, together with the possible issuance of preferred stock of the Company without stockholder approval, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder’s best interest. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our indebtedness. The terms of the indentures governing our debt securities do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness. If we or our subsidiaries are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in our revolving credit agreements and the indentures governing our debt securities, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we and they now face may intensify. Any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships or limit our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms. We cannot assure that any of our current ratings or the ratings of our subsidiaries’ will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Our ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a credit ratings downgrade or major market disruptions. Pricing grids associated with our credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse ratings impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the cost of our short-term borrowings, but a reduction in our credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require us to post cash collateral or letters of credit. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities. We have revolving credit agreements for working capital, capital expenditures, including acquisitions, and other corporate purposes. The levels of our debt could have important consequences, including the following: Ÿ the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms; Ÿ a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and Ÿ our debt levels may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. We are exposed to the credit risk of our key customers and counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers and counterparties could adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to credit risks in our generation, retail distribution, pipeline and energy trading operations. Credit risk includes the risk that customers and counterparties that owe us money or energy will breach their obligations. If such parties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected, and we could incur losses. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. 37
