Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit. In recent years, economic conditions were significantly strained in the United States. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices. If either of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability. Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, and shortening, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial increase in the prices of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices. Our failure to enter into effective hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings. In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas for firing ovens. Our independent distributors and third-party shipping companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin branded products to lower-margin store brands. Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability. The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share. We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 45.6% 10 Table of Contents of our sales during fiscal 2011. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sams Club, accounted for 21.6% of our sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales and profitability. If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our margins, and therefore our sales and profitability. Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations. From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us and their other suppliers. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a significant customers demands, we could lose that customers business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations. Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business. We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nations leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be adversely affected. We have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the companys liquidity. The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, which comprises approximately 11.6% of all the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2011. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows. We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, an adverse ruling by regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship program or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 11 Table of Contents Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics or labor strikes, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Inability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer. Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations. We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products. Government regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Any business disruption due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. Terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. In the event of such incidents, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. 12 Table of Contents Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws or regulations involving government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Legislation designed to control emissions affecting climate change could affect our ability to procure our commodity needs at costs we currently experience and may require additional unplanned capital expenditures. Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability. Pension, health care, and workers compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in pension, health care or workers compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results. We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations. From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the companys ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits. Acquisitions require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business to achieve the expected returns. Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Acquisitions or divestitures present unique financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from the existing core business, integrating or separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit any possible future acquisition of our company if not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of 13 Table of Contents our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions in our organizational documents that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:  A classified Board of Directors,  The requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause,  Specified requirements for calling special meetings of shareholders, and  The ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees, customers, creditors, and the local community. Our articles of incorporation also permit the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations, powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any further vote or action by our shareholders.
