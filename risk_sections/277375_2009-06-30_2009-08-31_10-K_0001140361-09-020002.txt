Item 1A. Risk Factors The risk factors below should be carefully considered. WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. Our revenues vary from year to year, depending on weather conditions. We estimate that approximately 75% of our annual gas sales are temperature sensitive. As a result, mild winter temperatures can cause a decrease in the amount of gas we sell in any year, which would reduce our revenues and profits. The weather normalization clause in our rate tariff, approved by the Kentucky Public Service Commission, only partially mitigates this risk. Under our weather normalization clause in our rate tariffs, we adjust our rates to residential and small non-residential customers to reflect variations from thirty-year average weather for our December through April billing cycles. CHANGES IN FEDERAL REGULATIONS COULD REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASE THE COST OF OUR INTERSTATE GAS SUPPLY. We purchase almost all of our gas supply from interstate sources. For example, in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, approximately 99% of our gas supply was purchased from interstate sources. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the transmission of the natural gas we receive from interstate sources, and it could increase our transportation costs or decrease our available pipeline capacity by changing its regulatory policies in a manner that could increase transportation rates or reduce pipeline or storage capacity available to us. OUR GAS SUPPLY DEPENDS UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY. We purchase almost all of our gas supply from interstate sources. Interstate pipeline companies transport the gas to our system. A decrease in interstate pipeline capacity available to us or an increase in competition for interstate pipeline transportation service could reduce our normal interstate supply of gas. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO ACQUIRE NATURAL GAS WITHOUT USING OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. Our larger customers can obtain their natural gas supply by purchasing their natural gas directly from interstate suppliers, local producers or marketers and arranging for alternate transportation of the gas to their plants or facilities. Customers may undertake such a by-pass of our distribution system in order to achieve lower prices for their gas service. Our larger customers who are in close proximity to alternative supply would be most likely to consider taking this action. This potential to by-pass our distribution system creates a risk of the loss of large customers and thus could result in lower revenues and profits. WE FACE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AT THE STATE LEVEL. We are regulated by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our regulated segment generates a significant portion of our income from operations. We face the risk that the Kentucky Public Service Commission may fail to grant us adequate and timely rate increases or may take other actions that would cause a reduction in our income from operations, such as limiting our ability to pass on to our customers our increased costs of natural gas. Such regulatory actions would decrease our revenues and our profitability. VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITS. Significant increases in the price of natural gas will likely cause our regulated retail customers to continue to conserve or switch to alternate sources of energy. Any decrease in the volume of gas we sell that is caused by such actions will reduce our revenues and profits. Higher prices also make it more difficult to add new customers. Significant decreases in the price of natural gas will likely cause our non-regulated segment margins to decrease. WE DO NOT ALWAYS GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO MEET ALL OUR CASH NEEDS. We make capital expenditures in order to maintain, expand and upgrade our distribution and transmission system. As a result, we fund a portion of our cash needs through borrowing and by offering new securities into the market. Although cash needs vary from year to year, our dependence on external sources of financing creates the risks that our profits could decrease as a result of high capital costs and that lenders could impose onerous and unfavorable terms on us as a condition to granting us loans. We also have the risk that we may not be able to secure external sources of cash necessary to fund our operations. In 2009 cash provided by operating activities was sufficient to meet our financing needs, and we were able to make a net repayment on our short-term bank line of credit in the amount of $3,176,000. INTERSTATE AND OTHER PIPELINES DELTA INTERCONNECTS WITH CAN IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PIPELINE. The pipelines interconnected to Delta's system are owned and operated by third parties who can impose restrictions on the quantity and quality of natural gas they will accept into their pipelines. To the extent natural gas on Delta's system does not conform to these restrictions, Delta could experience a decrease in volumes sold or transported to these pipelines. 9 Table of Contents FUTURE PROFITABILITY OF THE NON-REGULATED SEGMENT IS DEPENDENT ON A FEW INDUSTRIAL AND OTHER LARGE USE CUSTOMERS. Our larger non-regulated customers are primarily industrial and other large use customers. Fluctuations in the gas requirements of these customers can have a significant impact on the profitability of the non-regulated segment. We attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking additional opportunities for our non-regulated segment to sell gas to customers on and off Delta's system. CURRENT LEVELS OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY ARE UNPRECEDENTED. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption. In recent months, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain companies. To the extent that internally generated cash coupled with short-term borrowings under our bank line of credit is not sufficient for our operating cash requirements and normal capital expenditures we may need to obtain additional financing. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, under such extreme market conditions, there can be no assurance other financing sources would be available or sufficient. Additionally, our access to funds under our bank line of credit is dependent on the liquidity of the lender, Branch Banking & Trust Company. POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF PENSION PLAN HOLDINGS AND OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING PENSION PLAN COSTS COULD UNFAVORABLY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our cost of providing a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plan. Due to the conditions in the debt and equity markets, we experienced a decline in the value of the assets held by our defined benefit pension plan and thus we contributed $2,677,000 to the plan in fiscal 2009. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plan assets and depending upon the other factors impacting our costs as listed above, we could be required to fund our plan with additional significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK OF CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. Adverse economic conditions affecting, or financial difficulties of, customers and others with whom we do business could impair the ability of these customers and others to pay for our services or fulfill their contractual obligations or cause them to delay such payments or obligations. We depend on these customers and others to remit payments on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our cash flows, financial position or results of operations. SUBSTANTIAL OPERATIONAL RISKS ARE INVOLVED IN OPERATING A NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION, PIPELINE AND STORAGE SYSTEM AND SUCH OPERATIONAL RISKS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND INCREASE EXPENSES. There are substantial risks associated with the operation of a natural gas distribution, pipeline and storage system, such as operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions caused by events beyond our control. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of pipeline and storage facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, floods, landslides or other similar events beyond our control. These risks could result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage and environmental pollution, which in turn could lead to substantial financial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Liabilities incurred that are not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, interruptions to the operation of our gas distribution, transmission or storage system caused by such an event could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. HURRICANES OR OTHER EXTREME WEATHER COULD INTERRUPT OUR GAS SUPPLY AND INCREASE NATURAL GAS PRICES. Hurricanes or other extreme weather could damage production or transportation facilities, which could result in decreased supplies of natural gas and increased supply costs for us and higher prices for our customers. 10 Table of Contents CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS IN OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS INCREASE THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEFAULT ON OUR PART. Each indenture under which our outstanding debt has been issued, and the loan agreements for our bank line of credit, contains a cross-default provision which provides that we will be in default under such indenture or loan agreement in the event of certain defaults under any of the other indentures or loan agreements. Accordingly, should an event of default occur under one of our debt agreements, we face the prospect of being in default under all of our debt agreements and obliged in such instance to satisfy all of our then-outstanding indebtedness. In such an event, we might not be able to obtain alternative financing or, if we are able to obtain such financing, we might not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us. OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE VARIOUS NEGATIVE COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ACTIVITIES. Without bank approval or repaying the bank line of credit, our bank line of credit restricts us from: · merging with another entity, · selling a material portion of our assets other than in the ordinary course of business, · issuing stock which in the aggregate exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of our outstanding shares of common stock, and · having any person hold more than twenty percent (20%) of our outstanding shares of common stock. Our 7.00% Debentures and 5.75% Insured Quarterly Notes restrict us from: · assuming additional mortgage indebtedness in excess of $5,000,000, and · paying dividends on our common stock unless our consolidated shareholders’ equity minus the value of our intangible assets exceed $25,800,000. These negative covenants create the risk that we may be unable to take advantage of business and financing opportunities as they arise. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. Changes in laws and regulations, including new accounting standards and tax law, could change the way in which we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position, cash flows, results of operations or access to capital. Item 1B.
