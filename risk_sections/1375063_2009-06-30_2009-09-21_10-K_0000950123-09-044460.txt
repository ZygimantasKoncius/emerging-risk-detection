Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business We will require substantial additional funding, and our failure to raise additional capital necessary to support and expand our operations could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. As of June 30, 2009, we had $90.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. We funded $29.3 million to the Yima Joint Ventures in August 2009. We expect to continue to have operating losses until our Hai Hua plant and other projects under development produce significant revenues. We plan to use our cash for:  general and administrative expenses;  working capital;  debt service related to the HH Joint Venture;  project and technical development expenses; and  general corporate purposes. The actual allocation of and the timing of the expenditures will be dependent on various factors, including changes in our strategic relationships, commodity prices and industry conditions, and other factors that we cannot currently predict, including potential acquisitions of existing plants, facilities or mines. Depending on the expenditures required for our joint ventures, feasibility and engineering design work for these or other projects and any of the above factors, our expenditures could exceed our current cash balance. We will need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing for any new projects that are developed, to support our existing projects and any possible expansions thereof and for our general and administrative expenses from our existing operations. We are also continuing to work with Golden Concord and other potential partners on financing alternatives for that project. We may also need to raise additional funds sooner than expected in order to fund more rapid expansion, cover unexpected construction costs or delays, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary energy related products, services, businesses and/or technologies. In addition, we may attempt to secure project financing in order to construct additional plant facilities. Such financing may be used to reduce the amount of equity capital required to complete the project. We cannot assure you that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels; (ii) negotiate and enter into new gasification plant development contracts; (iii) expand our operations; (iv) hire and train new employees; or (v) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements. We are in an early stage of our development and our business strategies may not be accepted in the marketplace and may not help us to achieve profitability. We are in an early stage of our development and our lack of operating history or meaningful revenue precludes us from forecasting operating results based on historical results. Our proposed business strategies described in this annual report incorporate our senior managements current best analysis of potential markets, opportunities and difficulties that face us. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions accurately reflect current trends in our industry or our customers reaction to our products and services or that such products or services will be successful. Our business strategies may and likely will change substantially from time to time as our senior management reassesses its opportunities and reallocates its resources, and any such strategies may be changed or abandoned at any time. If we are unable to develop or implement these strategies through our projects and our U-GAS® technology, we may never achieve profitability which could impair our ability to continue as a going concern. Even if we do achieve profitability, it may not be sustainable, and we cannot predict the level of such profitability. Our results of operations may fluctuate. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Factors that may affect our operating results include: (i) our ability to retain new customers; (ii) the cost of coal and electricity; (iii) the success and acceptance of U-GAS® technology; (iv) the ability to obtain financing for our projects; (v) shortages of equipment, raw materials or fuel; (vi) approvals by various government agencies; (vii) the inability to obtain land use rights for our projects; and (viii) general economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the energy industry. In addition, our results of operation in the near future will be largely affected by syngas production levels at our Hai Hua plant. Under the syngas purchase and sale contract, Hai Hua is only required to pay the energy and capacity fee payments (described in Description of Business  Current Operations and Projects  Hai Hua  Syngas Purchase and Sale Agreement) if the syngas produced by the plant meets certain minimum specifications once the plant is in commercial operation. Any failure of this plant to meet these requirements would mean that Hai Hua would not be required to make the energy and capacity fee payments which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 11 Table of Contents Limited continuing rights of prior licensees of U-GAS® technology could limit the exclusivity of our license and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Prior to granting us an exclusive license, GTI licensed U-GAS® technology to five other entities, all of which have been terminated. We rely on our exclusive license with GTI for U-GAS® technology to negotiate, enter into and implement contracts with partners and customers and to further develop our business and operations. Certain predecessor licensees may have limited continuing rights under their license agreements with GTI or may have sublicensed the technology. Although neither we nor GTI are aware of any continued use or development of U-GAS® technology by any of these prior licensees or sublicensees, it is possible that the exclusivity of our license of U-GAS® technology may be restricted in certain areas of the world. If such rights do in fact exist, GTI does not intend to provide technical or any other support to such licensees. Despite GTIs intentions, any such limitations on the exclusivity of the license could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face the potential inability to protect our intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on proprietary technology licensed from GTI. Our license agreement with GTI for U-GAS® technology (described under BusinessGTI AgreementsLicense Agreement) is a critical component of our business. All of the prior patents granted around U-GAS® technology have expired. We are improving the technology and we plan to create new technologies around the core U-GAS® technology and have applied for new patents for these improvements and new technologies. Proprietary rights relating to U-GAS® technology are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, maintained within trade secrets or maintained in confidence through legally binding agreements. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, our ability to obtain patent protection may be affected by the terms of the License Agreement. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our technology or gain access to our proprietary information and technical know-how. In addition, we rely on proprietary information and technical know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. Proceedings initiated by us to protect our proprietary rights could result in substantial costs to us. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or that they will not use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe upon our patents. Pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us may relate to our products or technologies. We may need to acquire licenses to, or contest the validity of, any such patents. We cannot assure you that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms or that we would prevail in any such contest. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Continued disruption in U.S. and international economic conditions and in the commodity and credit markets may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. The global economy is currently experiencing a significant contraction, with an almost unprecedented lack of availability of business and consumer credit, which has seriously impeded our ability to obtain financing for our projects. This current decrease and any future decrease in economic activity in the United States, China or in other regions of the world in which we may in the future do business could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in a number of other ways. Any decline in economic conditions may reduce the demand or prices for the production from our plants. Our industry partners and potential customers and suppliers may also experience insolvencies, bankruptcies or similar events. In particular, the market for commodities such as methanol is under significant pressure and we are unsure of how much longer this will continue. As a direct result of these trends, our ability to finance and develop our existing projects, commence any new projects and sell our products may continue to be adversely impacted. In addition, the increased currency volatility could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Any of the above factors could also adversely affect our ability to access credit or raise capital even if the capital markets improve. 12 Table of Contents The U.S. governments current plans to address the financial crises may not be effective to stabilize the financial markets or to increase the availability of credit. In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, legislation was enacted that provides the U.S. Treasury the authority to, among other things, purchase mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets, and has discussed additional legislation that could expand this power. Despite these plans, the capital markets have continued to experience extreme levels of volatility and the credit markets have not yet shown any significant increase in the availability of credit. There can be no assurance what impact these plans ultimately will have on the financial markets. If the actions taken by the U.S. Treasury are not successful in stabilizing the financial markets and increasing the availability of credit, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. The termination of our license agreement with GTI or any of our joint venture agreements would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. The License Agreement and our joint ventures in China are essential to us and our future development. The License Agreement terminates on August 31, 2016, but may be terminated by GTI upon certain events of default if not cured by us within specified time periods. In June 2009, we agreed to pay GTI a non-refundable payment of $1.5 million toward future royalties due to GTI for the proposed Yima project. In conjunction with this agreement, GTI agreed to waive our next required obligation to put a U-GAS® system into operation until the earlier of a renegotiated license agreement or December 31, 2010. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in renegotiating the License Agreement on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, after the two ten year extension periods provided under the License Agreement, which are exercisable at our option, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining an extension of the term of the license at a royalty rate that we believe to be reasonable or at all. Our joint venture agreements do not terminate for many years, but may be terminated earlier due to certain events of bankruptcy or default, or, in the case of Hai Hua, if the purchase and sale contract for syngas is terminated. Termination of any of our joint ventures would require us to seek another collaborative relationship in that territory. We cannot assure you that a suitable alternative third party would be identified, and even if identified, we cannot assure you that the terms of any new relationship would be commercially acceptable to us. We utilize a technology with a limited commercial history. If the U-GAS® technology fails to gain or loses market acceptance, our business will suffer. Although GTI is one of the worlds leading energy research and development organizations with well-equipped research facilities, it does not have marketing resources to fully commercialize its U-GAS® technology. To date, U-GAS® technology has not been used in a large number of commercial facilities. U-GAS® technology may not meet reliability or efficiency targets. If U-GAS® technology is not generally accepted as a low cost energy alternative and we are unable to effectively manage the implementation of U-GAS® technology, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. We are dependent on our relationships with our strategic partners for project development. We are dependent on our relationships with our strategic partners to accelerate our expansion, fund our development efforts, better understand market practices and regulatory issues and more effectively handle challenges that may arise. Our future success will depend on these relationships and any other strategic relationships that we may enter into. We cannot assure you that we will satisfy the conditions required to maintain these relationships under existing agreements or that we can prevent the termination of these agreements. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into relationships with future strategic partners on acceptable terms. The termination of any relationship with an existing strategic partner or the inability to establish additional such relationships may limit our ability to develop our U-GAS® projects and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may never be able to reach agreements regarding the completion of future projects. Other than the HH Joint Venture, the Yima Joint Ventures and the GC Joint Venture, all of our other potential development opportunities are in the early stages of development and/or contract negotiations. Our joint ventures with Hai Hua, Yima and Golden Concord, discussed under BusinessCurrent Operations and Projects, are currently our only negotiated contracts. We are in the process of developing alternative potential partners for our Golden Concord project. We must undertake the time consuming and costly process of fulfilling the requirements of requests for proposals and negotiating contracts before offering our services to industrial complexes. We are unsure of when, if ever, many of these contracts will be negotiated, executed and implemented. There are many reasons that we may fail in our efforts to negotiate, execute and implement contracts with our target customers to provide cost efficient energy services, including the possibilities that: (i) our products and services will be ineffective; (ii) our products and services will be cost prohibitive or will not achieve broad market acceptance; (iii) competitors will offer superior products and services; or (iv) competitors will offer their products and services at a lower cost. 13 Table of Contents Our projects are subject to an extensive governmental approval process which could delay the implementation of our business strategy. Selling syngas, methanol and other commodities is highly regulated in many markets around the world. We believe our projects will be supported by the governmental agencies in the areas where the projects will operate because coal-based technologies, which are less burdensome on the environment, are generally encouraged by most governments. However, in China and other developing markets, the regulatory environment is often uncertain and can change quickly, often with contradictory regulations or policy guidelines being issued. In some cases, government officials have different interpretations of such regulations and policy guidelines and project approvals that are obtained by us could later be deemed to be inadequate. Furthermore, new policy guidelines or regulations could alter applicable requirements or require that additional levels of approval be obtained. If we are unable to effectively complete the government approval process in China and other markets in which we intend to operate, our business prospects and operating results could be seriously harmed. Joint ventures that we enter into present a number of challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our HH Joint Venture represents a substantial portion of our expected revenue in the near future. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we plan to enter into other joint ventures or similar transactions, some of which may be material. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies that arise after entering into the joint venture related to the counterparties to such joint ventures, with whom we share control. We could experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems due to challenges, including problems related to execution or integration. Any of these risks could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, we are now a minority owner in the Yima Joint Ventures and we will be relying on Yima to provide the management and operational support for the project. As a result, the success and timing of development activities on the Yima project will depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control. Dependence on Yima, and other owners of future projects in which we have a minority interest, could delay or prevent the realization of targeted returns on our capital invested in these projects. We also include the financial statements of the HH Joint Venture and the GC Joint Venture in our consolidated financial statements. We rely on personnel in China to compile this information and deliver it to us in a timely fashion so that the information can be incorporated into our consolidated financial statements prior to the due dates for our annual and quarterly reports. Any difficulties or delays in receiving this information or incorporating it into our consolidated financial statements could impair our ability to timely file our annual and quarterly reports. We or our joint venture partners will manage the design, procurement and construction of our plants. If our management of these issues fails, our business and operating results could suffer. For our HH Joint Venture and GC Joint Venture, and possibly for other projects we may work on in the future, we have or expect to manage plant design, procurement of equipment and supervise construction. Most of this work has been or will be subcontracted to third parties. We are and will be coordinating and supervising these tasks. Although we believe that this is the most time and cost effective way to build gasification plants in China and elsewhere, we bear the risk of cost and schedule overruns and quality control. If we do not properly manage the design, procurement and construction of our plants, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. Furthermore, as we continue to improve U-GAS® technology, we may decide to make changes to our equipment that could further delay the construction of our plants. Additionally, for certain of our projects, we will rely on joint venture partners to manage the design, procurement and construction of the plant. The success and timing of work on these projects by others will depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control. A portion of our revenues will be derived from the merchant sales of commodities and our inability to obtain satisfactory prices could have a material adverse effect on our business. In certain circumstances, we plan to sell methanol, DME, synthetic gasoline, SNG, ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen, elemental sulphur, ash and other commodities into the merchant market. These sales may not be subject to long term offtake agreements and the price will be dictated by the then prevailing market price. Revenues from such sales may fluctuate and may not be consistent or predictable. In particular, the market for commodities such as methanol is currently under significant pressure and we are unsure of how much longer this will continue. Our business and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to obtain satisfactory prices for these commodities or if prospective buyers do not purchase these commodities. 14 Table of Contents We are dependent on the availability and cost of low rank coal and coal waste and our inability to obtain a low cost source could have an impact on our business. The success of our projects will depend on the supply of low rank coal and coal waste. We intend to locate projects in areas where low cost coal and coal waste is available or where it can be moved to a project site easily without transportation issues. If we are unable to effectively obtain a source of low cost coal or coal waste for our projects, our business and operating results could be seriously affected. We are dependent on key personnel who would be difficult to replace. Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our officers and key employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have employment agreements, which include non-competition provisions, with Robert Rigdon, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Kelly, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, and certain other members of senior management, as a practical matter, those agreements will not assure the retention of our employees and we may not be able to enforce all of the provisions in any such employment agreement, including the non-competition provisions. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In addition, because substantially all of our operations are currently in China, we will be required to retain personnel who reside in, or are willing to travel to, and who speak the language and understand the customs of, China. Our inability to retain these types of individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Payment of severance benefits could strain our cash flow. During the past six months, we have made significant workforce reductions and may continue to do so in the future. Certain members of our senior management have employment agreements that provide for substantial severance payments. In the event we terminate the employment of any of these employees, or in certain cases, if such employees terminate their employment with us, such employees will be entitled to receive certain severance and related payments. The need to pay these severance payments could put a strain on our financial results. Our success will depend in part on our ability to grow and diversify, which in turn will require that we manage and control our growth effectively. Our business strategy contemplates growth and diversification. As we add to our services, our number of customers, and our marketing and sales efforts, operating expenses and capital requirements will increase. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require that we continue to expend funds to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we must effectively recruit new employees, and once hired, train and manage them. From time to time, we may also have discussions with respect to potential acquisitions, some of which may be material, in order to further grow and diversify our business. However, acquisitions are subject to a number of risks and challenges, including difficulty of integrating the businesses, adverse effects on our earnings, existence of unknown liabilities or contingencies and potential disputes with counterparties. We will be unable to manage our business effectively if we are unable to alleviate the strain on resources caused by growth in a timely and successful manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growth and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. We face intense competition. If we cannot gain market share among our competition, we may not earn revenues and our business may be harmed. The business of providing energy is highly competitive. In the gasification market, large multi-national industrial corporations that are better capitalized, such as General Electric, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Siemens (with entrained flow technologies), and smaller Chinese firms (with atmospheric pressure technologies) offer coal gasification equipment and services. Although we do not directly compete with the multi-national industrial corporations, their activities in the marketplace may negatively impact our operations and our ability to attract quality projects. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have extensive experience in related fields or greater financial resources, may enter the market. Increased competition could result in a loss of contracts and market share. Either of these results could seriously harm our business and operating results. In addition, there are a number of gasification and conventional, non-gasification, coal-based alternatives for producing heat and power that could compete with our technology in specific situations. If we are unable to effectively compete with other sources of energy, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. 15 Table of Contents In our areas of operation, the projects we intend to build are subject to rigorous environmental regulations, review and approval. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approvals, satisfy applicable requirements or maintain approvals once granted. Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, siting of facilities or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA and other state and local regulatory authorities in the United States, as well as various Chinese authorities at the municipal, provincial or central government level, issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial potential administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before construction and/or operations at a facility commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with such activities, limit or prohibit construction activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although to date we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with existing environmental requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not suffer such effects in the future. In China, developing, constructing and operating gasification facilities is highly regulated. In the development stage of a project, the key government approvals are the projects environmental impact assessment report, or EIA, feasibility study (also known as the project application report) and, in the case of a Sino-foreign joint venture, approval of the joint venture companys joint venture contract and articles of association. Approvals in China are required at the municipal, provincial and/or central government levels depending on the total size of the investment in the project. Prior to commencing full commercial operations, we also need additional environmental approvals to ensure that the facility will comply with standards adopted in the EIA. Although we have been successful in obtaining the permits that are required at this stage of our development, any retroactive change in policy guidelines or regulations or an opinion that the approvals that have been obtained are inadequate could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources on complying with such requirements or delay commencement of construction. For example, China recently issued new project approval requirements for coal to methanol and DME which could be applied to our existing permits. Other developments, such as the enactment of more stringent environmental laws, regulations or policy guidelines or more rigorous enforcement procedures, or newly discovered conditions, could require us to incur significant capital expenditures. We may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate control legislation and regulatory initiatives. Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, may be contributing to warming of the Earths atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as coal, is an example of a greenhouse gas. Our plants using U-GAS® technology may release a significant amount of carbon dioxide. In response to such studies, many countries are actively considering legislation, and many states in the United States have already taken legal measures, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives recently approved adoption of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, also known as the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade legislation, for the purposes of controlling and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States by establishing an economy-wide cap on emissions of these gases in the United States and requiring most sources of emissions to obtain emission allowances corresponding to their annual emissions of such gases, with the number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet the overall emission reduction goals. Although we plan to use advanced technologies to actively utilize and sequester any greenhouse gas emission, new legislation or regulatory programs, such as the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade legislation, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse affect on our operations, costs and ability to operate our plants. In the United States, carbon dioxide may be regulated in the future by the EPA as an air pollutant requiring us to obtain additional permits, meet additional control requirements, and install additional environmental mitigation equipment, which could adversely affect our financial performance. The United States Supreme Court recently decided a case in which it ruled that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act for the purposes of motor vehicle emissions. The lawsuit sought to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. If the EPA regulates carbon dioxide emissions by plants such as ours, we may have to apply for additional permits or we may be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other as yet unknown steps to comply with these potential regulations. Compliance with any future regulation of carbon dioxide, if it occurs, could be costly and may delay our development of projects in the U.S. Even if we obtain all of our necessary permits, the air quality standards or the interpretation of those standards may change, thus requiring additional control equipment or more stringent permitting requirements. Such requirements could significantly increase the operating costs and capital costs associated with any future development, expansion or modification of a plant. 16 Table of Contents Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Our management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We are required to comply with the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 and the related Securities and Exchange Commissions implementing rules, require that management disclose whether the CEO and CFO maintained internal control over financial reporting that, among other things, provides reasonable assurance that material errors in our external financial reports will be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and that we maintain support for that disclosure that includes evidence of our evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control. We are a small company with limited financial resources and our finance and accounting staff is very limited. Management has identified that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at ensuring that financial reporting risks arising from complex and non-routine transactions are identified timely and that appropriate accounting policies for such transaction are selected and applied. See Item 9a. Controls and Procedures for further discussion. We were not required to obtain an auditor attestation of managements report on internal control over financial reporting, but we will be required to do so for the year ending June 30, 2010. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully maintain the procedures, certification and attestation requirements of Section 404 or that we or our auditors will not identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, investors could lose confidence in our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Chinese Operations Foreign laws may not afford us sufficient protections for our intellectual property, and we may not be able to obtain patent protection outside of the United States. Despite continuing international pressure on the Chinese government, intellectual property rights protection continues to present significant challenges to foreign investors and, increasingly, Chinese companies. Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the commercial law in our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although we have taken precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiaries to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringement. Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiaries. China has put in place a comprehensive system of intellectual property laws; however, incidents of infringement are common and enforcement of rights can, in practice, be difficult. If we are unable to manage our intellectual property rights, our business and operating results may be seriously harmed. Our operations in China may be adversely affected by evolving economic, political and social conditions. Our operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally. Such risks include the adverse effects on operations from war, international terrorism, civil disturbances, political instability, governmental activities and deprivation of contract and property rights. In particular, since 1978, the Chinese government has been reforming its economic and political systems, and we expect this to continue. Although we believe that these reforms have had a positive effect on the economic development of China and have improved our ability to do business in China, we cannot assure you that these reforms will continue or that the Chinese government will not take actions that impair our operations or assets in China. In addition, periods of international unrest may impede our ability to do business in other countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Long term offtake agreements could be difficult to obtain and, if obtained, enforce because of Chinas underdeveloped legal system. Historically, it has been difficult to enter into or otherwise obtain long term offtake agreements in China. Even if we are able to enter into such agreements for syngas, power and other commodities in the future, we may have difficulty seeking remedies under the agreements due to less certainty under Chinas legal system, as compared to Western countries. We will seek to mitigate this risk by (i) dealing with reliable partners, (ii) obtaining all requisite government approvals, (iii) developing projects with good underlying economics, (iv) developing modular plants that can be moved away in an extreme circumstance, (v) using local banks to finance a majority of our project costs, and (vi) including enforceable arbitration provisions in all project agreements. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to successfully negotiate, implement and manage the offtake agreements. As a result, our business and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to enter into these agreements, or if entered to, to mitigate the risks associated with these agreements. Our results of operations would be negatively affected by potential currency fluctuations in exchange rates with foreign countries. Currency fluctuations, devaluations and exchange restrictions may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Exchange rates are influenced by political or economic developments in China, the United States or elsewhere and by macroeconomic factors and speculative actions. In some countries, local currencies may not be readily converted into U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or may only be converted at government controlled rates, and, in some countries, the transfer of hard currencies offshore has been restricted from time to time. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, if at all. Fluctuations in exchange rates can have a material impact on our costs of construction, our operating expenses and the realization of revenue from the sale of commodities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to offset any such fluctuations and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and will be negatively affected if foreign currencies, such as the Chinese Renminbi Yuan, depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange control regulations in China or other countries that restrict our ability to convert into U.S. dollars. Chinese regulations of loans and direct investment by offshore entities to Chinese entities may delay or prevent us from utilizing proceeds of funds to make loans or additional capital contributions to our operations in China, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. We may make loans or additional capital contributions to our operations in China. Any loans to our Chinese operations are subject to Chinese regulations and approvals. Such loans by us cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local counterpart. We may also decide to finance our Chinese operations by means of capital contributions. This capital contribution must be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital contributions by us to our Chinese operations or any of their subsidiaries. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use the proceeds of this offering and to capitalize our Chinese operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely and materially affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business. Risks Related to our Common Stock We may have a contingent liability arising out of the issuance of shares by Tamborine. In April 2005, we completed a merger with Tamborine Holdings, Inc., a shell company trading on the Pink Sheets, or Tamborine. 6,000,000 shares of Tamborine common stock remained outstanding after the merger and, through the merger and the related transactions, such shares became shares of our common stock. Prior to the merger, Tamborine filed two broker-dealer diligence forms with the Pink Sheets under Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, stating that 6,000,000 shares of Tamborine common stock had been sold in 2004 pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 504 of the Securities Act and that such shares were freely tradable under U.S. securities laws. It is our belief that these forms were filed to permit trading of the Tamborine common stock on the Pink Sheets. We believe that the 6,000,000 shares that were represented to be freely tradable in Tamborines filings, and which remained outstanding after the merger, were not in fact freely tradable when issued. There are no available definitive records, other than Tamborines 15c2-11 filings, regarding the issuance of those shares or the possible exemptions from registration under federal and state securities laws that were used to issue the shares or permit trading of the shares on the Pink Sheets. We believe that the filings may have been based on an incorrect and outdated interpretation of Rule 504. This means that resales of these shares on the Pink Sheets may have been in violation of applicable securities laws because the shares were in fact restricted and not freely tradable. Trading by subsequent holders may have been in accordance with applicable securities laws based on other available exemptions, but we do not have any documentation to confirm any such conclusions. 18 Table of Contents We have taken a number of steps to mitigate these issues. In the spring of 2007, we conducted a rescission offer to purchasers in our prior private placements and none of the purchasers elected to accept the offer. We also filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission causing us to become a reporting company under the Exchange Act, which simplifies the use of Rule 144 to trade our securities for eligible stockholders and provides more complete information to stockholders. We also listed our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market to create a more liquid market for our stockholders. Federal and state regulatory agencies could, however, re-examine these events and commence proceedings against us, our officers and directors (former and current) and the other individuals involved. Given the above facts, it is not possible at this time to predict the likelihood that we will in fact have any liability arising out of these events or the amount of such liability, if any. Our historic stock price has been volatile and the future market price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. The public market for our common stock has historically been very volatile. Any future market price for our shares is likely to continue to be very volatile. Since we began trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market on November 2, 2007, our common stock has traded at prices as low as $0.41 per share and as high as $15.92 per share. This price volatility may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell shares when they want at prices that they find attractive. We do not know of any one particular factor that has caused volatility in our stock price. However, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. Broad market factors and the investing publics negative perception of our business may reduce our stock price, regardless of our operating performance. If we do not meet the NASDAQ continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. As of September 8, 2009, the closing bid price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market was $1.17, but has closed under $1.00 as recently as August 17, 2009. In accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5), if our stock price were to close below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ would provide written notification that our securities may be delisted unless the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days within 180 calendar days from such notification. Given the recent market conditions, NASDAQ suspended the bid price requirement through July 31, 2009, but such requirement was reinstated on August 3, 2009. There can be no assurance that the market price per share of our common stock will remain above $1.00. In addition, there can be no assurance that our common stock will not be delisted due to a failure to meet other continued listing requirements even if the bid price of our common stock remains in excess of $1.00 per share. Failure to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market would have an adverse effect on a stockholders ability to sell its shares of our common stock, which could result in the complete loss of their investment. Our common stock is thinly traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market. Although our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, the trading volume has been low and we cannot assure investors that this will increase the trading volume or decrease the volatility of the trading price of our common stock. We cannot assure investors that a more active trading market will develop even if we issue more equity in the future. The market valuation of our business may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control and the value of the investment of our stockholders may fluctuate correspondingly. The market valuation of energy companies, such as us, frequently fluctuate due to factors unrelated to the past or present operating performance of such companies. Our market valuation may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:  Changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance;  Fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes, particularly among securities of energy companies;  Changes in market valuations of similar companies;  Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new technologies, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  Variations in our quarterly operating results;  Fluctuations in coal, oil, natural gas, methanol and ammonia prices; 19 Table of Contents  Loss of a major customer of failure to complete significant commercial contracts;  Loss of a relationship with a partner; and  Additions or departures of key personnel. As a result, the value of your investment in us may fluctuate. Investors should not look to dividends as a source of income. In the interest of reinvesting initial profits back into our business, we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any economic return will initially be derived, if at all, from appreciation in the fair market value of our stock, and not as a result of dividend payments. Item 1B.
