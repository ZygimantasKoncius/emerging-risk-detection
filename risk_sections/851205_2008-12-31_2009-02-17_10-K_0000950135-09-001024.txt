ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect our company in the future. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. This section includes or 7 Table of Contents refers to certain forward-looking statements. We refer you to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward-looking statements, appearing in Part II  Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Current and future conditions in the global economy may negatively impact our operating results. Our revenue is dependent upon the capital spending trends of manufacturers in a number of industries, including, among others, the semiconductor, electronics, automotive, metals, and paper industries. These spending levels are, in turn, impacted by global economic conditions, as well as industry-specific economic conditions. In recent months, the credit market crisis and slowing global economies have resulted in lower demand for our products as many of our customers experience deterioration in their businesses, cash flow issues, difficulty obtaining financing, and declining business confidence. Lower demand may continue indefinitely as existing and potential customers delay, reduce, or cancel capital spending. As a result, our business is subject to the following risks, among others:  our customers may not have sufficient cash flow or access to financing to purchase our products,  our customers may not pay us within agreed upon credit terms or may default on their payments altogether,  our vendors may be unable to fulfill their delivery obligations to us as their business deteriorates,  lower forecasted demand for our products may result in charges for excess and obsolete inventory if we are unable to sell inventory that is either already on hand or committed to purchase,  lower forecasted cash flows may result in impairment charges for acquired intangible assets or goodwill,  a decline in the fair value of our limited partnership interest in a venture capital fund, which is invested primarily in young and emerging companies, may result in an impairment charge,  a decline in our stock price may make stock options a less attractive form of compensation and a less effective form of retention for our employees, and  the trading price of our common stock may be volatile. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $212 million in either cash or investments that could be converted into cash. In addition, we have no long-term debt. We believe that our strong financial condition and historically high gross margins put us in a relatively good position to weather a prolonged economic downturn. Nevertheless, our operating results have been materially adversely affected in the past, and could be materially adversely affected in the future, as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by manufacturers worldwide. Downturns in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market may adversely affect our business. In 2008, approximately 17% of our revenue was derived from semiconductor and electronics capital equipment manufacturers. This concentration was as high as 61% in 2000 during its revenue peak. The semiconductor and electronics industries are highly cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have often had a severe effect on demand for production equipment that incorporates our products. While we have been successful in diversifying our business beyond OEM customers who serve the semiconductor and electronics industries, our business is still impacted by capital expenditures in these industries, which, in turn, are dependent upon the market demand for products containing computer chips. As a result, our operating results in the foreseeable future could be significantly and adversely affected by further declining sales in either of these industries. Furthermore, the competitive landscape in this market has changed in recent years, with price and the flexibility of purchasing hardware from other vendors becoming more important factors in the purchasing decisions of these manufacturers. In response to this market change, we have introduced software-only products. Although these products have high gross margins, the average selling price of these offerings is significantly lower than for a 8 Table of Contents complete vision system, and therefore, we expect this trend to have a negative impact on our revenue in this market. Economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and operating results. In 2008, approximately 70% of our revenue was derived from customers located outside of the United States. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, certain of our products are assembled by third-party contract manufacturers in Ireland and Southeast Asia. We intend to continue to expand our sales and operations outside of the United States and may enter additional international markets, such as our recent expansion into China and Eastern Europe, which will require significant management attention and financial resources. As a result, our business is subject to the risks inherent in international sales and operations, including, among other things:  various regulatory requirements,  export and import restrictions,  transportation delays,  employment regulations and local labor conditions,  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations,  instability in economic or political conditions,  difficulties protecting intellectual property,  business systems connectivity issues, and  potentially adverse tax consequences. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the use of derivative instruments to hedge these exposures could adversely affect our reported results, liquidity, and competitive position. We face exposure to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations, as a significant portion of our revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries or the reporting currency of our company, which is the U.S. Dollar. In certain instances, we utilize forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. These contracts are used to minimize foreign currency gains or losses, as the gains or losses on the derivative are intended to offset the losses or gains on the underlying exposure. We do not engage in foreign currency speculation. The success of our foreign currency risk management program depends upon forecasts of transaction activity denominated in various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, our failure to identify new exposures and hedge them in an effective manner may result in material foreign currency gains or losses. In addition, although the use of these derivative instruments may be effective in minimizing foreign currency gains or losses, significant cash inflows or outflows may result when these instruments are settled. The only foreign currencies in which a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated are the Euro and the Japanese Yen. Our predominant currency of sale is the U.S. Dollar in the Americas and Southeast Asia, the Euro in Europe, and the Yen in Japan. We estimate that approximately 58% of our sales in 2008 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and we expect sales denominated in foreign currencies to continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue. While we also have expenses denominated in these same foreign currencies, the impact on revenues has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, greater than the offsetting impact on expenses. Therefore, in times when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to these foreign currencies, we would expect to report a net 9 Table of Contents decrease in operating income. Conversely, in times when the U.S. Dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies, we would expect to report a net increase in operating income. Thus, changes in the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar may have a material impact on our operating results. Furthermore, our U.S. Dollar based pricing in Southeast Asia may put us at a competitive disadvantage with Asian vendors that offer local currency based pricing. The loss of a large customer could have an adverse effect on our business. In 2008, our top five customers accounted for approximately 7% of total revenue. Our expansion into the factory automation marketplace has reduced our reliance upon the revenue from any one customer. Nevertheless, the loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, any one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The failure of a key supplier to deliver quality product in a timely manner or our inability to obtain components for our products could adversely affect our operating results. A significant portion of our MVSD product is manufactured by two third-party contractors. As a result, we are dependent upon these contractors to provide quality product and meet delivery schedules. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring the performance of our third-party manufacturers; however, we may not detect all product quality issues through these programs and processes. In addition, a variety of components used in our products are only available from a single source. The announcement by a single-source supplier of a last-time component buy could result in our purchase of a significant amount of inventory that, in turn, could lead to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence. Furthermore, our vendors may experience deterioration in their businesses due to the credit market crisis and slowing global economy, which may impact their ability to fulfill their delivery obligations to us. Although we are taking certain actions to mitigate sole-source supplier risk, an interruption in, termination of, or material change in the purchase terms of any single-source components could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel. We are highly dependent upon the management and leadership of Robert J. Shillman, our Chief Executive Officer and President, as well as other members of our senior management team. Although we have many experienced and qualified senior managers, the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our company. Our continued growth and success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and on the ability of our officers and key employees to effectively manage the growth of our business through the implementation of appropriate management information systems and internal controls. We have historically used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation program in order to align employee interests with the interests of our shareholders, provide competitive compensation and benefits packages, and encourage employee retention. We are limited as to the number of options that we may grant under our stock option plan in future periods without shareholder approval. Furthermore, the recent decline in the stock market has made stock options a less effective means of retaining our employees. Accordingly, we may find it difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees, and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business. Our products may contain design or manufacturing defects, which could result in reduced demand, significant delays, or substantial costs. If flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and material repair or replacement costs. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively 10 Table of Contents monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and contract manufacturers, these actions may not be sufficient to avoid a product failure rate that results in:  substantial delays in shipment,  significant repair or replacement costs, or  potential damage to our reputation. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our failure to develop new products and to respond to technological changes could result in the loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and profits. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology. Accordingly, we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to accelerate time to market for new products and functionality with improved ease-of-use, performance, or price. We may not be able to introduce and market new products successfully, including our proposed Vision System on a Chip, and respond effectively to technological changes or new product introductions by competitors. Our ability to keep pace with the rapid rate of technological change in the high-technology marketplace could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our failure to effectively manage product transitions or accurately forecast customer demand could result in excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges. Because the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advances, we frequently introduce new products with improved ease-of-use, improved hardware performance, additional software features and functionality, or lower cost that may replace existing products. Among the risks associated with the introduction of new products are difficulty predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of the new product and avoid excess supply of the legacy product. In addition, we may strategically enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for our products in advance of demand in order to take advantage of favorable pricing or address concerns about the availability of future supplies. Furthermore, the recent global economic slowdown has resulted in lower forecasted demand for our products, which may result in excess or obsolete inventory if we are unable to sell inventory that either is already on hand or committed to purchase. Our failure to effectively manage product transitions or accurately forecast customer demand, in terms of both volume and configuration, has led to, and may again in the future lead to, an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges. Our failure to properly manage the distribution of our products and services could result in the loss of revenues and profits. We utilize a direct sales force, as well as a network of integration and distribution partners, to sell our products and services. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect sales channels to reach various potential customers for our products and services is a complex process. In addition, our reliance upon indirect selling methods may reduce visibility of demand and pricing issues. Each sales channel has distinct risks and costs, and therefore, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the sales model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. If we fail to successfully protect our intellectual property, our competitive position and operating results could suffer. We rely on our proprietary software technology and hardware designs, as well as the technical expertise, creativity, and knowledge of our personnel to maintain our position as a leading provider of machine vision products. Although we use a variety of methods to protect our intellectual property, we rely most heavily on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers, employees, and consultants. We also attempt to protect our intellectual property by 11 Table of Contents restricting access to our proprietary information by a combination of technical and internal security measures. These measures, however, may not be adequate to:  protect our proprietary technology,  protect our patents from challenge, invalidation, or circumvention, or  ensure that our intellectual property will provide us with competitive advantages. Any of these adverse circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our company may be subject to time-consuming and costly litigation. From time to time, we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits by competitors, customers, or other parties arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits charging patent infringement. We are currently a party to actions that are fully described in the section captioned Legal Proceedings, appearing in Part I  Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These matters can be time-consuming, divert managements attention and resources, and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, the results of any of these actions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our products and services. We compete with other vendors of machine vision systems, the internal engineering efforts of our current or prospective customers, and the manufacturers of image processing systems, automatic identification systems, and sensors. Any of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. In recent years, ease-of-use and product price have become significant competitive factors in the factory automation marketplace. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future and our investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and support activities may be insufficient to enable us to maintain our competitive advantage. In addition, competitive pressures could lead to price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We refer you to the section captioned Competition, appearing in Part I  Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the competition that we face. Implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase our revenue or profitability and result in the impairment of acquired intangible assets. We have in the past acquired, and will in the future consider the acquisition of, businesses and technologies in the machine vision industry. Our business may be negatively impacted by risks related to those acquisitions. These risks include, among others:  the inability to find or close attractive acquisition opportunities,  the diversion of managements attention from other operational matters,  the inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition,  the failure to retain key customers or employees, and  the impairment of acquired intangible assets resulting from lower-than-expected cash flows from the acquired assets. The recent global economic slowdown has resulted in lower forecasted revenue, which may result in lower estimated future cash flows from acquired assets and increase the likelihood of impairment. Acquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 12 Table of Contents We are at risk for impairment charges with respect to our investments or for acquired intangible assets or goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. At December 31, 2008, we had $221 million in cash and investments, and approximately $212 million of this balance represented either cash or investments in municipal bonds that could be converted into cash. The remaining balance included $2 million in auction rate securities and a $7 million limited partnership interest in a venture capital fund. The auction rate securities failed auction during 2008, and therefore, we were unable to sell these securities because of a lack of buying demand. To date, we have collected all interest payable on these securities when due and we believe the full principle value of these securities will ultimately be recovered. However, a default by the issuer would result in an impairment charge to write down this investment in a future period. The limited partnerships investments consist of a mix of young and emerging companies. The current worldwide economic slowdown and the credit market crisis will likely make the environment for these startups much less forgiving. As a result, it is possible that some of the younger companies in the portfolio that require capital investments to fund their current operations may not be as well prepared to survive this slowdown as would a more mature company. These factors will likely impact the fair value of the companies in the partnerships portfolio and may result in an impairment charge to write down this investment in a future period. At December 31, 2008, we had $31 million in acquired intangible assets, of which $26 million represented acquired distribution networks. These assets are susceptible to changes in fair value due to a decrease in the historical or projected cash flows from the use of the asset, which may be negatively impacted by economic trends. We have reviewed the expected cash flows from these acquired assets and believe their carrying values are recoverable; however, a decline in the cash flows generated by these assets, such as the revenue we are able to generate through our distribution network, may result in future impairment charges. At December 31, 2008, we had $81 million in acquired goodwill, $78 million of which is assigned to our Modular Vision Systems Division and $3 million of which is assigned to our Surface Inspection Systems Division. The fair value of goodwill is susceptible to changes in the fair value of the reporting segments in which the goodwill resides, and therefore, a decline in our market capitalization or cash flows relative to the net book value of our segments may result in future impairment charges. If we determine that any of these investments, acquired intangible assets, or goodwill is impaired, we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may have additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect out operating results and financial condition. We are subject to income taxes in the United States, as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our financial statements and could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.
