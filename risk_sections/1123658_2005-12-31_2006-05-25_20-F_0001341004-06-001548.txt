Risk Factors" and the following: o fluctuations in crude oil prices, o fluctuations in prices of our products, o failures or delays in achieving production from development projects, o potential acquisitions and other business opportunities, o general economic, market and business conditions, and o other risks and factors beyond our control. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this annual report are qualified by these cautionary statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the various important factors set forth above and elsewhere in this Form 20-F.

PART I ITEM 1. IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORS Not applicable. ITEM 2. OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE Not applicable. ITEM 3 KEY INFORMATION A. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected income statement data and cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, and the selected balance sheet data as of December 31, 2004 and 2005 have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. The selected income statement data and cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 and the selected balance sheet data as of December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included elsewhere in this annual report and financial statements of the acquired businesses described below. We acquired from Sinopec Group Company the equity interests of Sinopec National Star Petroleum Company (Sinopec National Star) in 2001, the operations of Sinopec Group Maoming Petrochemical Company (Sinopec Maoming), Xi'an Petrochemical Main Factory (Xi'an Petrochemical) and Tahe Oilfield Petrochemical Factory (Tahe Petrochemical) in 2003, and the operations of Sinopec Group Tianjin Petrochemical Company, Sinopec Group Luoyang Petrochemical General Plant, Zhongyuan Petrochemical Company Limited, Sinopec Group Guangzhou Petrochemical General Plant and certain catalyst plants (collectively, Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets) in 2004. As we and these companies are under the common control of Sinopec Group Company, our acquisitions are considered as "combination of entities under common control" which are accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, the acquired assets and related liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial position and the results of operations of these companies on a combined basis. Moreover, the selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements together with accompanying notes and "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects " included elsewhere in this annual report. Unless otherwise indicated, our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. IFRS vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or US GAAP. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in Note 39 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial position and results of operations of these acquired companies on a combined basis. The considerations for these acquisitions were treated as equity transactions. (2) Basic earnings per share and per ADS have been computed by dividing net income attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue. (3) Includes the effect of the revaluation of property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 1999. In addition, property, plant and equipment of Sinopec Maoming, Xi'an Petrochemical, Tahe Petrochemical, and Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets were revalued as of June 30, 2003, October 31, 2003, October 31, 2003 and June 30, 2004, respectively, in connection with the acquisitions by Sinopec Corp. (4) Equals the sum of short-term debts, long-term debts, loans from Sinopec Group Company and its affiliates and total equity less cash and cash equivalents. (5) Translated solely for the convenience of the readers into US dollars at the rate prevailing on December 31, 2005 of US$1.00 to RMB 8.0702. (6) As described in Note 38 to the consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications to periods prior to 2005 have been made to comply with certain new IFRS's adopted in 2005. B. CAPITALIZATION AND INDEBTEDNESS Not applicable. C. REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable. D. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Sinopec Corp. Our development plans have significant capital expenditure and financing requirements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our current capital expenditures plan contemplates approximately RMB 70 billion in 2006. Our actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from these planned amounts due to various factors. Our ability to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties including: o our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows; o the economic condition in China and the market environment for our products; o the cost of financing and the condition of financial markets; and o the issuance of relevant government approvals and other project risks associated with the development of infrastructure in China. Our failure to obtain sufficient funding for our operations or development plans could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face strong competition from domestic and foreign competitors. Among our competitors, some are major integrated petroleum and petrochemical companies within and outside the PRC, which have recently become more significant participants in the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China. We believe such trend will continue. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to pass on all increases in our crude oil costs. In 2005, approximately 80% of the crude oil required for our refinery business was sourced from outside suppliers. In addition, our development will leave us no choice but to source an increasing amount of crude oil from outside suppliers. While we try to match price increases with corresponding crude oil price increases, our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers is dependent on international and domestic market conditions as well as the PRC government price control over refined petroleum products. In 2004 and 2005, crude oil price increased significantly, but we were not able to pass the increased material cost to our customers due to the government's tight control over prices of certain refined petroleum products including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Although it was reported that new petroleum products price-setting mechanism had been formulated by the relevant government authority, we cannot predict when the revised price-setting mechanism will be fully implemented, and if implemented, to what extent the new price-setting mechanism will allow us to pass our increased crude oil costs to our refined petroleum products customers. Related party transactions; non-competition; conflicts of interest. We have engaged from time to time and will continue to engage in a variety of transactions with Sinopec Group Company, which provides to us a number of services, including, but not limited to, ancillary supply, engineering, maintenance, transport, educational and community services. The nature of our transactions with Sinopec Group Company is governed by a number of service and other contracts between Sinopec Group Company and us. In addition, Sinopec Group Company has interests in businesses which compete or are likely to compete, either directly or indirectly, with our businesses. We and Sinopec Group Company have entered into a non-competition agreement whereby Sinopec Group Company has agreed to refrain from operating businesses which compete or could compete with us in any of our domestic or international markets; grant us an option to purchase Sinopec Group Company's operations that compete or could compete with our businesses; operate its sales enterprises and service stations in a manner uniform to our sales and service operations; and appoint us as sales agent for certain of its products which compete or could compete with our products. Notwithstanding the foregoing contractual arrangements, because Sinopec Group Company is our dominant shareholder and the interests of the Sinopec Group Company may conflict with our own interests, Sinopec Group Company or any of its member may take actions that favor its interests or other subsidiaries' interests over ours. In addition, while we and Sinopec Group Company have entered into agreements which generally provide that these services provided by Sinopec Group Company will be priced on terms at least as favorable to us as ordinary commercial terms, we have limited or no practical alternative source of supply for some of these services, utilities, materials and equipment at reasonable cost. As a result, in the future we may have limited ability to negotiate with Sinopec Group Company over the terms of our agreements with respect to these services, utilities, materials and equipment. The oil and natural gas reserves data in this annual report are only estimates, and our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may differ materially from these estimates. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, and in the timing of development expenditures and the projection of future rates of production. The reserve data set forth in this annual report represent estimates only. Adverse changes in economic conditions may render it uneconomical to develop certain reserves. Our actual production, revenues, taxes and fees payable and development and operating expenditures with respect to our reserves may likely vary from these estimates. The reliability of reserves estimates depends on: o the quality and quantity of technical and economic data; o the prevailing oil and gas prices applicable to our production; o the production performance of the reservoirs; o extensive engineering judgments; and o consistency in the PRC government's oil policies. In addition, new drilling, testing and production following the estimates may cause substantial upward or downward revisions in the estimates. Furthermore, the discounted future cash flow calculated by applying the 10% discount rate, which was included in "Consolidated Financial Statements-Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)" following Item 19, may not represent the actual net present value of the relevant cash flow. Our continued business success depends in part on our ability to replace reserves and develop newly discovered reserves. Our ability to achieve our growth objectives is dependent in part on our level of success in discovering or acquiring additional oil and natural gas reserves and further exploring our current reserve base. Our exploration and development activities for additional reserves expose us to inherent risks associated with drilling, including the risk that no economically productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. Without reserve additions through further exploration and development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline over time as our reserves will be depleted. We are in the process of improving our internal controls and management systems to enable us to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our failure to timely and successfully upgrade these controls and systems could subject us to regulatory actions and harm the price of our stock. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company in the United States to include a management report on such company's internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting. These requirements will first apply to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still be unable to attest to our management's assessment or may issue a report that concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. In preparation for the implementation of the requirements of Section 404, we are undertaking company-wide documentation of internal controls, performing the system and process evaluation and testing required. During the course of our evaluation, documentation and attestation, we have identified certain deficiencies that could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data consistent with our management's assertions in our financial statements. Although we have commenced planning for remedial measures to make necessary improvements, we cannot assure you that we will be able to remedy those identified deficiencies in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. We are also in the process of conducting further evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and may identify other deficiencies that we may not be able to remedy in time by the deadline for compliance with Section 404. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls, on an ongoing basis, over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading prices of our ADSs or H shares. Furthermore, we have already incurred considerable costs and spent significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs and use significant resources for compliance with Section 404. Risks Relating to the Petroleum and Petrochemical Industry Our business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations. As an integrated petroleum and petrochemical company, we are subject to extensive environmental protection laws and regulations in China. These laws and regulations permit: o the imposition of fees for the discharge of waste substances; o the levy of fines and payments for damages for serious environmental offenses; and o the government, at its discretion, to close any facility which fails to comply with orders and require it to correct or stop operations causing environmental damage. Our production operations produce substantial amounts of waste water, gas and solid waste materials. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and revocation. We have established a system to treat waste materials to prevent and reduce pollution and believe that our operations substantially comply with all applicable PRC environmental laws and regulations as they have been previously interpreted and enforced. The PRC government has moved, and may move further, toward more rigorous enforcement of applicable laws, and toward the adoption of more stringent environmental standards, which, in turn, would require us to incur additional expenditures on environmental matters. Our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the market. Most of our revenues are attributable to sales of refined petroleum products and petrochemical products, and certain businesses and related products have historically been cyclical and sensitive to the availability and prices of feedstock and general economic conditions, such as changes in industry capacity and output levels, cyclical changes in regional and global economic conditions, prices and availability of substitute products and changes in consumer demand. With the further reduction of tariffs and other import restrictions in the PRC, many of our products have become increasingly subject to the cyclicality of global markets. While we are a company integrated with upstream, midstream and downstream operations, it can help us reduce the effects of industry cycles only to a certain extent. Our business faces operation risks and natural disasters that may cause significant property damages, personal injuries and interruption of operations, and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all the financial losses incurred by us. Exploring for, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas and producing and transporting refined and petrochemical products involve a number of hazards. For example, we handle many highly flammable, explosive, poisonous and harmful materials and operate many facilities under high pressure and high temperatures. As with many other companies in the world which conduct similar businesses, we have experienced accidents that have caused property damage and personal injuries and we cannot assure you that these industry-related accidents will not occur in the future. In addition, significant operating hazards and natural disasters may cause interruption to our operations and property and environmental damages that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all the financial losses caused by the operation risks and natural disasters. We maintain insurance coverage with Sinopec Group Company on our property, plant, equipment and inventory. The amount of coverage is determined on the basis of the historical value of the covered fixed assets and, with respect to inventory, twice each year on the basis of the average month-end inventory value of the most recent six months. The amount of our insurance coverage may be less than the replacement cost of the covered properties and plants and may not be sufficient to cover all our financial losses. Furthermore, we do not carry any business interruption insurance or third party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injury, property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our property or relating to our operations other than third party liability insurance with respect to certain transportation vehicles. Losses incurred or payments required to be made by us, which are not fully insured, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Risks Relating to the PRC Government regulations may limit our activities and affect our business operations. The PRC government, though gradually liberalizing its regulation of oil and petrochemical industry, continues to exercise a certain degree of control over the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China by, among others: o licensing the right to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas; o publishing from time to time guidance prices for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel; o allocating and pricing of certain resources and services; o assessing taxes and fees payable, such as the recently imposed special levy on revenues generated from sales of domestically produced crude oil when the realized price exceeds US$40 per barrel; o setting import and export quotas and procedures; and o setting safety, environmental and quality standards. As a result, we may face certain constraints on our flexibility and ability to expand our business operations or to maximize our profitability. Also see "-- Risks Relating to Sinopec Corp -- we may not be able to pass on all increases in our crude oil costs." Some of our development plans require compliance with state policies and regulatory confirmation and registration. We are currently engaged in a number of construction, renovation and expansion projects. Some of our large construction, renovation and expansion projects are subject to governmental confirmation and registration. The timing and cost of completion of these projects will depend on numerous factors, including such confirmation and registration from relevant PRC government authorities and general economic conditions in China. If any of our important projects required for our future growth are not confirmed or registered, or not confirmed or registered in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Entry by China into the World Trade Organization significantly increases competition from foreign companies in our lines of business. China became a member of the World Trade Organization ("WTO") in December 2001. In entering the WTO, China has agreed to significantly reduce the trade barriers over time for imports that have historically existed and that currently exist in China such as: o granting foreign-owned companies the right to import into China crude oil and refined petroleum products through companies authorized by the PRC government; o permitting foreign companies to distribute and market refined petroleum products in both retail and wholesale markets in China; and o significantly reducing tariffs on refined petroleum products and petrochemical products. As the refined petroleum product wholesale market is expected to open to foreign producers in 2006, we will face more competition in refined petroleum products market. Such increased foreign competition may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Government control of currency conversion and exchange rate fluctuation may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. A portion of such revenues will need to be converted into other currencies to meet our foreign currency needs, including but not limited to: o import of crude oil and other materials; o debt service on foreign currency-denominated debt; o purchases of imported equipment; and o payment of any cash dividends declared in respect of the H shares (including ADS) . The existing foreign exchange regulations have significantly reduced government foreign exchange controls for transactions under the current account, including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions and payment of dividends. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing, or to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures. The PRC government has stated publicly that it intends to make the Renminbi freely convertible in the future. However, we cannot predict whether the PRC government will continue its existing foreign exchange policy and when the PRC government will allow free conversion of Renminbi. The value of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including US dollars, has historically been set by the People's Bank of China. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the US dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy resulted initially in an approximately 2.0% appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar. Since the adoption of this new policy, the value of Renminbi against the US dollar has fluctuated on a daily basis within narrow ranges, but overall has further strengthened against the US dollar. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to further liberalize its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar. As we outsource a significant portion of our crude oil requirement which are benchmarked to US dollar-denominated international prices, fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollars and certain other foreign currencies may affect our crude oil costs. In addition, any significant revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material effect on our revenues and financial conditions, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADSs in foreign currency terms. Enforcement of shareholder rights; mandatory arbitration. Currently, the primary sources of shareholder rights are our articles of association, the PRC Company Law and the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which, among other things, impose certain standards of conduct, fairness and disclosure on us, our directors and our controlling shareholder. In general, their provisions for protection of shareholder's rights and access to information are different from those applicable to companies incorporated in the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. In addition, the mechanism for enforcement of rights under the corporate framework to which we are subject may also be relatively undeveloped and untested. To our knowledge, there has not been any published report of judicial enforcement in the PRC by H share shareholders of their rights under constituent documents of joint stock limited companies or the PRC Company Law or in the application or interpretation of the PRC or Hong Kong regulatory provisions applicable to PRC joint stock limited companies. We cannot assure you that our shareholders will enjoy protections that they may be entitled in other jurisdictions. China does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States, the United Kingdom or most other Western countries, and therefore recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of these jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may not be assured. Our articles of association as well as the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange provide that most disputes between holders of H shares and us, our directors, supervisors, officers or holders of domestic shares, arising out of the articles of association or the PRC Company Law concerning the affairs of our company or with respect to the transfer of our shares, are to be resolved through arbitration by arbitration organizations in Hong Kong or China, rather than through a court of law. On June 18, 1999, an arrangement was made between Hong Kong and the PRC for the mutual enforcement of arbitral awards. This new arrangement was approved by the Supreme People's Court of the PRC and the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and became effective on February 1, 2000. So far as we are aware, no action has been brought in China by any shareholder to enforce an arbitral award, and we are uncertain as to the outcome of any action brought in China to enforce an arbitral award granted to shareholders.
