RISK FACTORS Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business We provide a public service regulated by the Mexican government, and our flexibility in managing our aeronautical activities is limited by the regulatory environment in which we operate. Our aeronautical fees charged to airlines and passengers are regulated, like most airports in other countries. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, approximately 67.0%, 67.8% and 66.4%, respectively, of our total revenues, and approximately 76.1%, 75.6% and 74.0%, respectively, of the sum of our aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues were earned from aeronautical services, which are subject to price regulation under our maximum rates. These regulations may limit our flexibility in operating our aeronautical activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition. In addition, several of the regulations applicable to our operations that affect our profitability are authorized (as in the case of our master development programs) or established (as in the case of our maximum rates) by the Ministry of Communications and Transportation for five-year terms. We generally do not have the ability to unilaterally change our obligations (such as the investment obligations under our master development programs or the obligation under our concessions to provide a public service) or increase our maximum rates applicable under those regulations should the passenger traffic or other assumptions on which the regulations were based change during the applicable term. In addition, there can be no assurance that this price regulation system will not be amended in a manner that would cause additional sources of our revenues to be regulated. Our maximum rates and annual efficiency adjustments will be renegotiated in 2015. In 2015, the Ministry of Communications and Transportation will set our maximum rates and annual efficiency adjustments for 2016 through 2020. For a discussion of the framework for establishing our maximum rates and the application of these rates, see Â“
