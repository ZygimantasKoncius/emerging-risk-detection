Risk factors There are known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to Smith & Nephews business. The factors listed below could cause the Groups business, financial position and results of operations to differ materially and adversely from expected and historical levels. In addition, other factors not listed here that Smith & Nephew cannot presently identify or does not believe to be equally significant could also materially adversely affect Smith & Nephews business, financial position or results of operations. Highly competitive markets The Groups business segments compete across a diverse range of geographic and product markets. Each market in which the business segments operate contains a number of different competitors, including specialised and international corporations. Significant product innovations, technical advances or the intensification of price competition by competitors could adversely affect the Groups operating results. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Smith & Nephew. These competitors may be able to initiate technological advances in the field, deliver products on more attractive terms, more aggressively market their products or invest larger amounts of capital and research and development (R&D) into their businesses. There is a possibility of further consolidation of competitors, which could adversely affect the Groups ability to compete with larger companies due to insufficient financial resources. If any of the Groups businesses were to lose market share or achieve lower than expected revenue growth, there could be a disproportionate adverse impact on the Groups share price and its strategic options. Competition exists among healthcare providers to gain patients on the basis of quality, service and price. There has been some consolidation in the Groups customer base and this trend is expected to continue. Increased competition and unanticipated actions by competitors or customers could lead to downward pressure on prices and/or a decline in market share in any of the Groups business areas, which could adversely affect Smith & Nephews results of operations and hinder its growth potential. Continual development and introduction of new products The medical devices industry has a rapid rate of new product introduction. In order to remain competitive, each of the Groups business segments must continue to develop innovative products that satisfy customer needs and preferences or provide cost or other advantages. Developing new products is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. The Group may fail to innovate due to low R&D investment, a R&D skills gap or poor product development. A potential product may not be brought to market or not succeed in the market for any number of reasons, including failure to work optimally, failure to receive regulatory approval, failure to be cost-competitive, infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in consumer demand. The Groups products and technologies are also subject to marketing attack by competitors. Furthermore, new products that are developed and marketed by the Groups competitors may affect price levels in the various markets in which the Groups business segments operate. If the Groups new products do not remain competitive with those of competitors, the Groups revenue could decline. The Group maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. Marketplace changes resulting from the introduction of new products or surgical procedures may cause some of the Groups products to become obsolete. The Group makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilisation dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favourable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Dependence on government and other funding In most Established Markets throughout the world, expenditure on medical devices is ultimately controlled to a large extent by governments. Funds may be made available or withdrawn from healthcare budgets depending on government policy. The Group is therefore largely dependent on future governments providing increased funds commensurate with the increased demand arising from demographic trends. Pricing of the Groups products is largely governed in most Established Markets by governmental reimbursement authorities. Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, excise taxes and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Group has operations. This control may be exercised by determining prices for an individual product or for an entire procedure. The Group is exposed to government policies favouring locally sourced products. The Group is also exposed to changes in reimbursement policy, tax policy and pricing which may have an adverse impact on revenue and operating profit. In particular, changes to the healthcare legislation in the US have imposed significant taxes on medical device manufacturers from 2013. There may be an increased risk of adverse changes to government funding policies arising from the deterioration in macro-economic conditions in some of the Groups markets. The Group must adhere to the rules laid down by government agencies that fund or regulate healthcare, including extensive and complex rules in the US. Failure to do so could result in fines or loss of future funding. World economic conditions Demand for the Groups products is driven by demographic trends, including the ageing population and the incidence of osteoporosis and obesity. Supply of, use of and payment for the Groups products are also influenced by world economic conditions which could place increased pressure on demand and pricing, adversely impacting the Groups ability to deliver revenue and margin growth. The conditions could favour larger, better capitalised groups, with higher market shares and margins. As a consequence, the Groups prosperity is linked to general economic conditions and there is a risk of deterioration of the Groups performance and finances during adverse macro-economic conditions. During 2013, economic conditions worldwide continued to create several challenges for the Group, including deferrals of joint replacement procedures, heightened pricing pressure, significant declines in capital equipment expenditures at hospitals and increased uncertainty over the collectability of European government debt, particularly those in certain parts of southern Europe. These factors tempered the overall growth of the Groups global markets and could have an increased impact on growth in the future. Table of Contents SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 GROUP INFORMATION 157 Political uncertainties The Group operates on a worldwide basis and has distribution channels, purchasing agents and buying entities in over 90 countries. Political upheaval in some of those countries or in surrounding regions may impact the Groups results of operations. Political changes in a country could prevent the Group from receiving remittances of profit from a member of the Group located in that country or from selling its products or investments in that country. Furthermore, changes in government policy regarding import quotas, taxation or other matters could adversely affect the Groups revenue and operating profit. War, terrorist activities or other conflict could also adversely impact the Group. Currency fluctuations Smith & Nephews results of operations are affected by transactional exchange rate movements in that they are subject to exposures arising from revenue in a currency different from the related costs and expenses. The Groups manufacturing cost base is situated principally in the US, the UK, China and Switzerland, from which finished products are exported to the Groups selling operations worldwide. Thus, the Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the US Dollar, Sterling and Swiss Franc and the currency of the Groups selling operations, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. If the US Dollar, Sterling or Swiss Franc should strengthen against the Euro, Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen, the Groups trading margin could be adversely affected. The Group manages the impact of exchange rate movements on revenue and cost of goods sold by a policy of transacting forward foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed. In addition, the Groups policy is for forecast transactions to be covered between 50% and 90% for up to one year. The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and the US Dollar is the functional currency of Smith & Nephew plc. The Groups revenues, profits and earnings are also affected by exchange rate movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes. See Liquidity and capital resources on page 99. Manufacturing and supply The Groups manufacturing production is concentrated at 14 main facilities in Memphis, Mansfield and Oklahoma City in the US, Hull, Warwick and Gilberdyke in the UK, Aarau in Switzerland, Tuttlingen in Germany, Fort Saskatchewan and Calgary in Canada, Sangameshwar in India, Suzhou and Beijing in China and Curaçao. If major physical disruption took place at any of these sites, it could adversely affect the results of operations. Physical loss and consequential loss insurance is carried to cover such risks but is subject to limits and deductibles and may not be sufficient to cover catastrophic loss. Management of orthopaedic inventory is complex, particularly forecasting and production planning. There is a risk that failures in operational execution could lead to excess inventory or individual product shortages. Each of the business segments is reliant on certain key suppliers of raw materials, components, finished products and packaging materials or in some cases on a single supplier. These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to the Groups standard of quality requirements. If any of these suppliers is unable to meet the Groups needs, compromises on standards of quality or substantially increases its prices, Smith & Nephew would need to seek alternative suppliers. There can be no assurance that alternative suppliers would provide the necessary raw materials on favourable or cost-effective terms at the desired quality. Consequently, the Group may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain raw materials, which it may not be able to pass on to its customers in the form of increased prices for its finished products. In addition, some of the raw materials used may become unavailable, and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to obtain suitable and cost-effective substitutes. Any interruption of supply caused by these or other factors could negatively impact Smith & Nephews revenue and operating profit. The Group will, from time to time, outsource the manufacture of components and finished products to third parties and will periodically relocate the manufacture of product and/or processes between existing facilities. While these are planned activities, with these transfers there is a risk of disruption to supply. Attracting and retaining key personnel The Groups continued development depends on its ability to hire and retain highly-skilled personnel with particular expertise. This is critical, particularly in general management, research, new product development and in the sales forces. If Smith & Nephew is unable to retain key personnel in general management, research and new product development or if its largest sales forces suffer disruption or upheaval, its revenue and operating profit would be adversely affected. Additionally, if the Group is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce, it may not be able to meet its strategic business objectives. Proprietary rights and patents Due to the technological nature of medical devices and the Groups emphasis on serving its customers with innovative products, the Group has been subject to patent infringement claims and is subject to the potential for additional claims. Claims asserted by third parties regarding infringement of their intellectual property rights, if successful, could require the Group to expend time and significant resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing products or obtain licences to the products which are the subject of such litigation, thereby affecting the Groups growth and profitability. Smith & Nephew attempts to protect its intellectual property and regularly opposes third party patents and trademarks where appropriate in those areas that might conflict with the Groups business interests. If Smith & Nephew fails to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights successfully, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its results of operations. Product liability claims and loss of reputation The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices entail risk of product liability claims or recalls. Design and manufacturing defects with respect to products sold by the Group or by companies it has acquired could damage, or impair the repair of, body functions. The Group may become subject to liability, which could be substantial, because of actual or alleged defects in its products. In addition, product defects could lead to the need to recall from the market existing products, which may be costly and harmful to the Groups reputation. There can be no assurance that customers, particularly in the US, the Groups largest geographical market, will not bring product liability or related claims that would have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position or results of operations in the future, or that the Group will be able to resolve such claims within insurance limits. Table of Contents 158 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 GROUP INFORMATION Group information continued Regulatory standards and compliance in the healthcare industry Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities. In general, the trend in many countries in which the Group does business is towards higher expectations and increased enforcement activity by governmental authorities. While the Group is committed to doing business with integrity and welcomes the trend to higher standards in the healthcare industry, the Group and other companies in the industry have been subject to investigations and other enforcement activity that have incurred and may continue to incur significant expense. See Note 17 to the Group accounts. Under certain circumstances, if the Group were found to have violated the law, its ability to sell its products to certain customers could be restricted. International regulation The Group operates across the world and is subject to legislation, including anti-bribery and corruption and data protection, in each country in which we operate. Our international operations are governed by the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which prohibit us or our agents from making, or offering, improper payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business or product approvals. Enforcement of such legislation has increased in recent years with significant fines and penalties being imposed on companies and individuals. Our international operations, particularly in the emerging markets, expose the Group to the risk that our employees or agents will engage in prohibited activities. Regulatory approval The international medical device industry is highly regulated. Regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether substances and materials can be developed into marketable products and the amount of time and expense that should be allotted to such development. National regulatory authorities administer and enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, approval, manufacture, labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy of such products. Of particular importance is the requirement in many countries that products be authorised or registered prior to manufacture, marketing or sale and that such authorisation or registration be subsequently maintained. The major regulatory agencies for Smith & Nephews products include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and the China Food and Drug Administration. At any time, the Group is awaiting a number of regulatory approvals which, if not received, could adversely affect results of operations. The trend is towards more stringent regulation and higher standards of technical appraisal. Such controls have become increasingly demanding to comply with and management believes that this trend will continue. Regulatory requirements may also entail inspections for compliance with appropriate standards, including those relating to Quality Management Systems or Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. All manufacturing and other significant facilities within the Group are subject to regular internal and external audit for compliance with national and Group medical device regulation and policies. Payment for medical devices may be governed by reimbursement tariff agencies in a number of countries. Reimbursement rates may be set in response to perceived economic value of the devices, based on clinical and other data relating to cost, patient outcomes and comparative effectiveness. They may also be affected by overall government budgetary considerations. The Group believes that its emphasis on innovative products and services should contribute to success in this environment. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could have a number of adverse consequences, including withdrawal of approval to sell a product in a country, temporary closure of a manufacturing facility, fines and potential damage to company reputation. Failure to make successful acquisitions A key element of the Groups strategy for continued growth is to make acquisitions or alliances to complement its existing business. Failure to identify appropriate acquisition targets or failure to conduct adequate due diligence or to integrate them successfully would have an adverse impact on the Groups competitive position and profitability. This could result from the diversion of management resources towards the acquisition or integration process, challenges of integrating organisations of different geographic, cultural and ethical backgrounds, as well as the prospect of taking on unexpected or unknown liabilities. In addition, the availability of global capital may make financing less attainable or more expensive and could result in the Group failing in its strategic aim of growth by acquisition or alliance. Relationships with healthcare professionals The Group seeks to maintain effective and ethical working relationships with physicians and medical personnel who assist in the research and development of new products or improvements to our existing product range or in product training and medical education. If we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to meet the demands of our customers could be diminished and our revenue and profit could be materially adversely affected. Reliance on sophisticated information technology The Group uses a wide variety of information systems, programmes and technology to manage our business. Our systems are vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, loss of data privacy or any other significant disruption. Our systems have been and will continue to be the target of such threats. We have systems in place to minimise the risk and disruption of these intrusions and to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective in protecting Smith & Nephew from future interruptions and as a result the performance of the Group could be materially adversely affected. Other risk factors Smith & Nephew is subject to a number of other risks, which are common to most global medical technology groups and are reviewed as part of the Groups risk management process. Factors affecting Smith & Nephews results of operations Government economic, fiscal, monetary and political policies are all factors that materially affect the Groups operation or investments of shareholders. Other factors include sales trends, currency fluctuations and innovation. Each of these factors is discussed further in the Our Marketplace on pages 16 to 18, Segment performance on pages 24 to 33 and Taxation information for shareholders on pages 175 and 176.

Table of Contents SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 161 Non-GAAP Financial Information Revenue Underlying growth in revenue is used to compare the revenue in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis. This is achieved by adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired in material business combinations and for movements in exchange rates. Underlying growth in revenue is not presented in the accounts prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is therefore a measure not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (a non-GAAP measure). The Group believes that the tabular presentation and reconciliation of reported revenue growth to underlying revenue growth assists investors in their assessment of the Groups performance in each business segment and for the Group as a whole. Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency since it excludes those items considered to be outside the influence of local management. The Groups management uses this non-GAAP measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performance on both a business segment and a consolidated Group basis. Revenue growth at constant currency is important in measuring business performance compared to competitors and compared to the growth of the market itself. The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed to local managements efforts with respect to the business in the year of acquisition. Depending on the timing of the acquisition, there will usually be a further step change in the following year. A measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth from acquisitions. The process of making business acquisitions is directed, approved and funded from the Group corporate centre in line with strategic objectives. The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure is that it excludes certain factors, described above, which ultimately have a significant impact on total revenues. The Group compensates for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates in its investment, strategic planning and resource allocation. In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not within the control of local management, performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business is integrated. The Groups management considers that the non-GAAP measure of underlying growth in revenue and the GAAP measure of growth in revenue are complementary measures, neither of which management uses exclusively. Underlying growth in revenue reconciles to growth in revenue reported, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the constant currency exchange effect and the acquisitions and disposals effect, described below. The constant currency exchange effect is a measure of the increase/decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar sales. This is measured as the difference between the increase in revenue translated into US Dollars on a GAAP basis (i.e. current year revenue translated at the current year average rate, prior year revenue translated at the prior year average rate) and the increase measured by translating current and prior year revenue into US Dollars using the prior year closing rate. The acquisitions and disposals effect is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired business combinations. This is calculated by comparing the current year, constant currency actual revenue (which include acquisitions and exclude disposals from the relevant date of completion) with prior year, constant currency actual revenue, adjusted to include the results of acquisitions and exclude disposals for the commensurate period in the prior year. These sales are separately tracked in the Groups internal reporting systems and are readily identifiable. Reported revenue growth, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, reconciles to underlying growth in revenue as follows: 2013% 2012% 2011% Reported revenue growth 5 (3 ) 8 Constant currency exchange effect 1 2 (4 ) Acquisition/Disposals effect (2 ) 3  Underlying revenue 4 2 4 A reconciliation of reported revenue growth to underlying revenue growth, by business segment, can be found on page 37. Trading profit Trading profit is a trend measure which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affects the Groups short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends. The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets and impairments; significant restructuring events; acquisition costs; and gains and losses resulting from legal disputes and uninsured losses. Growth in trading profit and trading profit margin (trading profit expressed as a percentage of revenue) are measures which present the growth trend in the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions or events that management considers affect the Groups short-term profitability. The Group presents these measures to assist investors in their understanding of the trends. The Groups international financial reporting (budgets, monthly reporting, forecasts, long-term planning and incentive plans) focuses primarily on profit and earnings before these items. Trading profit and trading profit margin are not recognised measures under IFRS and are therefore non-GAAP financial measures. Table of Contents 162 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Other financial information continued Operating profit, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, reconciles to trading profit as follows: 2013 $million 2012 $million 2011 $million Operating profit 810 846 862 Acquisition-related costs 31 11  Restructuring and rationalisation costs 58 65 40 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments 88 43 36 Legal claim (see page 130)   23 Trading profit 987 965 961 A reconciliation of operating profit to trading profit, by business segment, can be found on page 38. Adjusted earnings per ordinary share Growth in adjusted earnings per ordinary share (EPSA) is another measure which presents the trend in the long-term profitability of the Group. EPSA is not a recognised measure under IFRS and is therefore a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS is earnings per ordinary share. EPSA excludes the same impact of specific transactions or events that management considers affect the Groups short-term profitability, is used by the Group for similar purposes, and is subject to the same material limitations, as set out and discussed in the above section on trading profit. Adjusted attributable profit represents the numerator used in the EPSA calculation. Adjusted attributable profit is reconciled to attributable profit, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with IFRS, as follows: 2013 $million 2012 Restated $million 2011 Restated $million Attributable profit for the year 556 721 575 Acquisition-related costs 31 11  Restructuring and rationalisation expenses 58 65 40 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments 88 43 36 Profit on disposal of net assets held for sale  (251 )  Legal claim (see page 130)   23 Taxation on excluded items (see page 109) (40 ) 82 (17 ) Adjusted attributable profit 693 671 657 The material limitation of these measures is that they exclude significant income and costs that have a direct impact on current and prior years profit attributable to shareholders. They do not, therefore, measure the overall performance of the Group presented by the GAAP financial measure of operating profit. The Group considers that no single measure enables it to assess overall performance and therefore it compensates for the limitation of the trading profit measure by considering it in conjunction with its GAAP equivalent. The gains or losses which are identified separately arise from irregular events or transactions. Such events or transactions are authorised centrally and require a strategic assessment which includes consideration of financial returns and generation of shareholder value. Amortisation of acquisition intangibles will occur each year, whilst other excluded items arise irregularly depending on the events that give rise to such items. Earnings per Ordinary Share 2013 2012 Restated 2011 Restated Basic 61.7¢ 80.4¢ 64.5¢ Diluted 61.4¢ 80.0¢ 64.2¢ Adjusted: Basic 76.9¢ 74.8¢ 73.7¢ Adjusted: Diluted 76.5¢ 74.5¢ 73.4¢ Trading cash flow and trading profit to cash conversion ratio Growth in trading cash flow and improvement in the trading profit to cash conversion ratio are measures which present the trend growth in the long-term cash generation of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions or events that management considers affect the Groups short-term performance. Trading cash flow is defined as cash generated from operations less net capital expenditure but before acquisition-related cash flows, restructuring and rationalisation cash flows and cash flows arising from legal disputes and uninsured losses. Trading profit to cash conversion ratio is trading cash flow expressed as a percentage of trading profit. The nature and material limitations of these adjusted items are discussed above. The Group presents those measures to assist investors in their understanding of trends. The Groups internal financial reporting (budgets, monthly reporting, forecasts, long-term planning and incentive plans) focuses on cash generation before these items. Trading cash flow and trading profit to cash conversion ratio are not recognised measures under IFRS and are therefore considered non-GAAP financial measures. The material limitation of this measure is that it could exclude significant cash flows that have had a direct impact on the current and prior years financial performance of the Group. It does not, therefore, measure the financial performance of the Group presented by the GAAP measure of cash generated from operations. The Group considers that no single measure enables it to assess financial performance and therefore it compensates for the limitation of the trading cash flow measure by considering it in conjunction with the GAAP equivalents. Cash flows excluded relate to irregular events or transaction costs and cash flows arising from legal disputes and uninsured losses. Table of Contents SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 163 Trading cash flow reconciles to cash generated from operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, as follows: 2013$million 2012$million 2011$million Cash generated from operations 1,138 1,184 1,135 Less: Capital expenditure (340 ) (265 ) (321 ) Add: Cash received on disposal of fixed assets    Add: Acquisition-related costs 25 3 1 Add: Restructuring and rationalisation related expenditure 54 55 20 Add: Legal settlement  22  Add: Macrotexture expenditure   3 Trading cash flow 877 999 838 Trading profit 987 965 961 Trading profit to cash conversion ratio 89% 104% 87% Transactional and translational exchange The Groups principal markets outside the US are, in order of significance, Continental Europe, UK, Australia and Japan. Revenues in these markets fluctuate when translated into US Dollars on consolidation. During the year, the average rates of exchange against the US Dollar used to translate revenues and profits arising in these markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro strengthened from $1.28 to $1.33 (+3%), Sterling weakened from $1.58 to $1.56 (-1%), the Swiss Franc strengthened from $1.07 to $1.08 (1%), the Australian Dollar weakened from $1.04 to $0.96 (-7%) and the Japanese Yen weakened from ¥79.8 to ¥97.6 (-22%). The Groups principal manufacturing locations are in the US (Advanced Surgical Devices), Switzerland (Advanced Surgical Devices), UK (Advanced Wound Management and Advanced Surgical Devices) and China (Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management). The majority of the Groups selling and distribution subsidiaries around the world purchase finished products from these locations. As a result of currency movements compared with the previous year, sales from the US became relatively more profitable to all of these countries. The Groups policy of purchasing forward a proportion of its currency requirements and the existence of an inventory pipeline reduce the short-term impact of currency movements. Contractual obligations Contractual obligations at 31 December 2013 were as follows: Payments due by period Total$ million Less than1 year$ million 13 years$ million 35 years$ million More than5 years$ million Debt obligations 377 42 335   Finance lease obligations 14 2 4 5 3 Operating lease obligations 123 45 51 22 5 Retirement benefit obligation 72 72    Purchase obligations      Capital expenditure 41 41    Other 41 34 7   668 236 397 27 8 Other contractual obligations represent $20m of foreign exchange contracts and $21m of acquisition consideration. Provisions that do not relate to contractual obligations are not included in the above table. The agreed contributions for 2014 in respect of the Groups defined benefits plans are: $39m for the UK (including $31m of supplementary payments), $26m for the US Plan and $7m for other funded defined benefit plans. The table above does not include amounts payable in respect of 2015 and beyond as these are subject to future agreement and amounts cannot be reasonably estimated. There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change in control of the Company or the Group following a takeover, such as bank loan agreements and Company share plans. None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole. In addition, there are service contracts between the Company and its Executive Directors which provide for the automatic payment of a bonus following loss of office or employment occurring because of a successful takeover bid. Further details are set out on page 70. The Company does not have contracts or other arrangements which individually are essential to the business. Table of Contents 164 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Other financial information continued 2012 Financial highlights Revenue Group revenue decreased by $133m (-3%) from $4,270m in 2011 to $4,137m in 2012. Underlying revenue growth was 2% of which -2% growth was attributable to unfavourable currency translation and -3% was attributable to the effect of disposing of the Clinical Therapies business. Advanced Surgical Devices revenues decreased by $143m (-4%), underlying growth of 2% was offset by -2% unfavourable currency movements and -4% due to the disposal of the Clinical Therapies business. Advanced Wound Management revenues increased by $10m (1%), underlying growth was 4% with -3% due to unfavourable currency translation. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold decreased by $70m to $1,070m from $1,140m in 2011, which represents a 6% decrease. Of this movement, 1% is due to favourable currency translation movements. The remaining movement is largely attributable to the continued focus on costs, and partly attributable to the sale of the Clinical Therapies business in May 2012 which impacted both revenue and cost of sales. Marketing, selling and distribution expenses Marketing, selling and distribution expenses decreased by $86m (-6%) to $1,440m from $1,526m in 2011. The underlying movement of -4% is after adjusting for favourable currency movement of -2%. Increased cost savings in Established Markets were partly offset by investment in Emerging & International Markets and promotion of new products particularly in Advanced Wound Management. Administrative expenses Administrative expenses increased by $35m (6%) to $610m from $575m in 2011. Favourable currency movements offset 2% of this increase. The main factors contributing to the underlying movement of 8% were an increase of $16m in amortisation on acquisition costs. Research and development expenses Expenditure as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.2% to 4.1% in 2012 (2011  3.9%). Actual expenditure was $171m in 2012 compared to $167m in 2011. The Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate it from competitors. Operating profit Operating profit decreased by $16m to $846m from $862m in 2011. This comprised an increase of $2m in Advanced Surgical Devices and a decrease of $18m in Advanced Wound Management. Advanced Surgical Devices started to see the benefits of its focus on costs (more than offsetting the additional restructuring expense) whilst Advanced Wound Management has continued to invest in new products throughout the year and also acquired Healthpoint Biotherapeutics in December 2012, both increasing costs. Net interest receivable/(payable) Net interest payable reduced by $10m from $8m payable in 2011 to a receivable of $2m in 2012. This is a consequence of the overall reduction of borrowings within the Group, a reduction in the applicable interest rates and the $7m interest receivable on the Bioventus loan note issued following the disposal of the Clinical Therapies business. Other finance cost Other finance costs, restated for the revised IAS 19 Employee Benefits accounting standard, in 2012 were $11m compared to $13m in 2011. This decrease is attributable to an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets. Taxation The taxation charge increased by $105m to $371m from $266m in 2011. The rate of tax was 33.7%, compared with 31.4% in 2011. The tax charge increased by $82m in 2012 (2011  $17m reduction) as result of the profit on disposal of the Clinical Therapies business partially offset by an increase in restructuring and rationalisation expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and acquisition-related costs. The tax rate was 29.9% (2011  29.9%) after adjusting for these items and the tax thereon. Group balance sheet The following table sets out certain balance sheet data as at 31 December of the years indicated: 2012$million 2011$million Non-current assets 3,498 2,542 Current assets 2,144 2,080 Assets held for sale  125 Total assets 5,642 4,747 Non-current liabilities 828 422 Current liabilities 930 1,119 Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale  19 Total liabilities 1,758 1,560 Total equity 3,884 3,187 Total equity and liabilities 5,642 4,747 Non-current assets Non-current assets increased by $956m to $3,498m in 2012 from $2,542m in 2011. This is principally attributable to the following:  Goodwill increased by $90m from $1,096m in 2011 to $1,186m in 2012. Of this movement $73m arose on the acquisition of Healthpoint. The balance relates to favourable currency movements totalling $17m  Intangible assets increased by $641m from $423m in 2011 to $1,064m in 2012. Intangible assets totalling $662m arose on the Healthpoint acquisition. Amortisation of $94m was charged during the year and assets with a net book value of $3m were written-off. A total of $68m relates to the cost of intellectual property and software acquired. The balance relates to favourable currency movements totalling $8m Table of Contents SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 165  Property, plant and equipment increased by $10m from $783m in 2011 to $793m in 2012. Depreciation of $212m was charged during 2012 and assets with a net book value of $9m were written-off. These movements were largely offset by $197m of additions relating primarily to instruments and other plant and machinery and $27m of additions arising on the Healthpoint acquisition. The balance relates to favourable currency movements totalling $7m  Deferred tax assets decreased by $59m in the year  The total investment in associates has increased from $13m in 2011 to $283m in 2012. This movement predominately relates to the acquisition of Bioventus during the year totalling $114m plus $160m in the form of a loan note to Bioventus. Current assets Current assets increased by $64m to $2,144m from $2,080m in 2011. The movement relates to the following:  Inventories rose by $42m to $901m in 2012 from $859m in 2011. Of this movement, $46m arose on the Healthpoint acquisition and it includes $9m relating to favourable currency movements  The level of trade and other receivables increased by $28m to $1,065m in 2012 from $1,037m in 2011. This movement includes $31m arising on the Healthpoint acquisition and $8m related to favourable currency movements  Cash and cash equivalents have fallen by $6m to $178m from $184m in 2011. Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities increased by $406m from $422m in 2011 to $828m in 2012. This movement relates to the following items:  Long-term borrowings have risen from $16m in 2011 to $430m in 2012. This increase of $414m is attributable to the acquisition of Healthpoint for $728m cash in December 2012  The net retirement benefit obligation decreased by $21m to $266m in 2012 from $287m in 2011. This was largely due to the Groups additional pension contributions which were partially offset by net actuarial losses for the year  Deferred acquisition consideration remains at $8m at the end of 2012. This relates to the acquisition of Tenet Medical Engineering during 2011  Provisions increased from $45m in 2011 to $63m in 2012. The principal component of this movement is $13m arising on the Healthpoint acquisition  Deferred tax liabilities decreased by $5m in the year. Current liabilities Current liabilities decreased by $189m from $1,119m in 2011 to $930m in 2012. This movement is attributable to:  Bank overdrafts and current borrowings have decreased by $268m from $306m in 2011 to $38m in 2012  Trade and other payables have increased by $92m to $656m in 2012 from $564m in 2011. The primary cause of this increase is the acquisition of Healthpoint which increased trade and other payables by $49m  Provisions have decreased by $19m from $78m in 2011 to $59m in 2012. The most significant item contributing to this decrease is the payment of $22m to settle the legal provision (see Note 3 of the Notes to the Group accounts)  Current tax payable is $177m at the end of 2012 compared to $171m in 2011. Total equity Total equity increased by $697m from $3,187m in 2011 to $3,884m in 2012.

Of this decrease, underlying growth of 2% is offset by -2% unfavourable currency movements and -4% due to the disposal of the Clinical Therapies business. The underlying increase in ASD revenue reconciles to reported growth, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, as follows: 2012% 2011% Reported growth (4 ) 8 Constant currency exchange effect 2 (4 ) Disposal effect 4  Underlying growth 2 4 In the Established Markets, revenue decreased by $163m to $2,747m (-6%).

In the Established Markets outside of the US revenue decreased by $45m to $1,298m (-3%). Underlying growth was 1% with -4% due to unfavourable currency movements.

Knee implant franchise revenue increased by 1% to $874m in 2012, which represented an underlying revenue growth of 3% and unfavourable foreign currency translation of -2%. This compared to a market growth rate of 3%. Growth slowed in the second half of 2012 as a result of a weakening of the overall knee market in Europe and the divisions knee product cycle. Between 2009 and 2011, when the division materially outperformed the knee market, it benefited from the launch of VERILAST Technology and VISIONAIRE Patient Matched Instrumentation. This benefit has now been annualised. In the global Hip implant franchise revenue decreased by $39m to $666m (-6%) in 2012, representing a -3% underlying revenue decline in the face of the continuing metal-on-metal headwinds and -2% due to unfavourable foreign currency translation. The Hip implant franchise, led by the ANTHOLOGY Hip with VERILAST Technology, has also continued to perform well in its focus product areas. Sales of our BIRMINGHAM Hip Resurfacing system continued to decline during the year. The BIRMINGHAM Hip Resurfacing System is a clinically proven system for hip resurfacing which preserves bone and is particularly suited for younger, more active male patients. Global Trauma revenue increased by $5m to $462m (1%), representing underlying revenue growth of 3% and -2% unfavourable foreign currency translation.

The revenue in this Other franchise (excluding Clinical Therapies) increased by $2m to $69m (5%), which represented an underlying revenue growth of 7% and -2% of unfavourable foreign currency translation. Trading and operating profit Trading profit increased by $14m (2%) to $728m from $714m in 2011. Trading profit margin increased from 21.9% to 23.4%. These increases reflect the early benefits of implementing the Strategic Priorities, in particular, restructuring the Group to provide the right commercial models and cost structure. Operating profit increased by $2m from $630m in 2011 to $632m in 2012. This comprises the increase in trading profit of $14m discussed above and the recognition of a legal claim of $23m in 2011, offset by an increase of $10m in the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and a $25m increase in restructuring and rationalisation costs.

Trading and operating profit Trading profit reduced by $10m to $237m from $247m and trading profit margin decreased 24.3% to 23.1%. The decrease in the year is primarily attributable to the additional costs arising from investment in new products throughout the year. Operating profit decreased by $18m to $214m in 2012. This comprises the decrease in trading profit of $10m discussed above and an increase of $11m in connection with the acquisition-related costs on the purchase of Healthpoint.

Table of Contents SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 171 Dividend history Smith & Nephew has paid dividends on its ordinary shares in every year since 1937. Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 2000 the Group adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover (the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the Selected financial data, to ordinary dividends declared for the year). This was intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments. From 2000 to 2004 the dividend increased in line with inflation and, in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times. Having achieved this level of dividend cover the Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%. Following the redenomination of the Companys share capital into US Dollars the Board re-affirmed its policy of increasing the dividend by 10% a year in US Dollar terms. On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value of ordinary dividends over time broadly based on the Groups underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and cash flows. From 2013, the Board will review at the time of the full year results, the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year. The Board intends that the interim dividend will be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year. Dividends will continue to be declared in US Dollars with an equivalent amount in Sterling payable to those Shareholders whose registered address is in the UK, or who have validly elected to receive Sterling dividends. An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November. A final dividend will be recommended by the Board of Directors and paid subject to approval by Shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting. Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings; the future financial condition of the Group; the Boards dividend policy; and the additional factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in Special note regarding forward-looking statements and Risk Factors.

All dividends, up to the second interim dividend for 2005, were declared in pence per ordinary share and translated into US cents per ordinary share at the Noon Buying Rate on the payment date. Since the second interim dividend for 2005 all dividends have been declared in US cents per Ordinary Share. The 2013 final dividend will be payable on 7 May 2014, subject to Shareholder approval. In respect of the proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 17.0 US cents per ordinary share, the record date will be 22 April 2014 and the payment date will be 7 May 2014. The Sterling equivalent per ordinary share will be set following the record date. Shareholders may elect to receive their dividend in either Sterling or US Dollars and the last day for election will be 22 April 2014. The ordinary shares will trade ex-dividend on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges from 16 April 2014.

The ordinary shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Each ADS represents five ordinary shares. The ADS facility is sponsored by The Bank of New York Mellon acting as depositary. All the ordinary shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, rank pari passu with each other. On 23 January 2006 the ordinary shares of 12 2/9 pence were redenominated as ordinary shares of US 20 cents (following approval by Shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting in December 2005). The new US dollar ordinary shares carry the same rights as the previous ordinary shares. The share price continues to be quoted in Sterling and the ADSs continue to represent five ordinary shares. In 2006 the Company issued £50,000 of shares in Sterling in order to comply with English law. These were issued as deferred shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange. They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value. These shares were allotted to the Chief Executive Officer, although the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. As at 24 February 2014, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 18,188 registered holders of ordinary shares, of whom 89 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of 172,541 ordinary shares (0.02% of the total issued). Because certain ordinary shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of Shareholders with registered addresses in the US is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of ordinary shares resident in the US. Shareholdings As at 24 February 2014, 7,837,412 ADSs equivalent to 39,187,060 ordinary shares or approximately 4.4% of the total ordinary shares in issue, were outstanding and were held by 88 registered holders. Major Shareholders As far as is known to Smith & Nephew, the Group is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and the Group has not entered into arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Group. As at 24 February 2014, no persons are known to Smith & Nephew to have any interest (as defined in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FCA) in 3% or more of the ordinary shares, other than as shown below. The following tables show changes over the last three years in the percentage and numbers of the issued share capital owned by Shareholders holding 3% or more of ordinary shares, as notified to the Company under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules: As at 31 December 24 February 2014% 2013 % 2012 % 2011 % Invesco 7.5 12.1 11.9 5.0 BlackRock, Inc. 4.8 4.7 5.0 5.0 Newton Investment Management Limited   4.9 5.0 Legal & General Group plc   3.0 4.0 Capital Group of Companies Inc.    0.7 As at 31 December 24 February 2014000 2013000 2012000 2011000 Invesco 66,740 107,823 107,823 44,901 BlackRock, Inc. 42,621 41,870 44,811 44,811 Newton Investment Management Limited   8,432 44,337 Legal & General Group plc   26,906 35,676 Capital Group of Companies Inc.    6,138 In addition to the above, the Company is aware that Walter Scott & Partners Limited held approximately 37.7 million ordinary shares (4.2%) at 24 February 2014. The Company is not aware of any person who has a significant direct or indirect holding of securities in the Company, and is not aware of any persons holding securities which may control the Company. There are no securities in issue which have special rights as to the control of the Company.

Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephews securities, except for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by Her Majestys Treasury of the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the government or residents of certain countries. There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the Articles of Association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK residents to hold or to exercise voting rights in respect of ordinary shares, except that where any overseas Shareholder has not provided to the Company a UK address for the service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other document to an overseas address. It is, however, the current practice of the Company to send every notice or other document to all Shareholders regardless of the country recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details of the Companys dividend reinvestment plan, which are not sent to Shareholders with recorded addresses in the US and Canada. Table of Contents SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 175 Taxation information for Shareholders The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are based on the Groups understanding of certain aspects of current UK and US federal income tax law and practice relevant to the ADSs and ordinary shares not in ADS form. The comments address the material US and UK tax consequences generally applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares and who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a citizen or resident of the US, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised in or under the laws of the US, or an estate or trust the income of which is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source (each a US Holder). The comments set out below do not purport to address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or ordinary shares which may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position of Shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of the Companys issued ordinary shares. This discussion does not apply to (i) persons whose holding of ADSs or ordinary shares is effectively connected with or pertains to either a permanent establishment in the UK through which a US Holder carries on a business in the UK or a fixed base from which a US Holder performs independent personal services in the UK, or (ii) persons whose registered address is inside the UK. This discussion does not apply to certain investors subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to use the mark to market method of tax accounting, partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, US Holders holding ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction or whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US dollar and US Holders liable for alternative minimum tax. In addition, the comments below do not address the potential application of the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code, known as the Medicare contribution tax, or any US state, local or non-US (other than UK) taxes. The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets. The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax consequences to them of the ownership of ADSs or ordinary shares. The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company was not a passive foreign investment company for its taxable year ended 31 December 2013. This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of US federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs. However, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom depositary shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary (pre-released) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders. Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released. Taxation of dividends in the UK and the US The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK corporation, such as the Company. Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income to a US Holder to the extent paid out of the Companys current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income tax purposes. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US Holders. Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than those applicable to other types of ordinary income if certain conditions are met. Non- corporate US Holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates. Taxation of capital gains US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital gain realised upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares unless the ADSs or ordinary shares are held in connection with a trade carried on in the UK through a permanent establishment (or in the case of individuals, through a branch or agency). Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or ordinary shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may remain subject to UK taxation of capital gains on gains realised while non-resident. For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon a taxable sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares by US Holders generally will be US source capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADSs or ordinary shares were held for more than one year. The amount of a US Holders gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised on the sale or other disposition and such holders tax basis in the ADSs, or ordinary shares, determined in US dollars. Inheritance and estate taxes The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death. The HM Revenue & Customs considers that the US/UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift Tax applies to inheritance tax. Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the US and is not a UK national or domiciled in the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares. A UK national who is domiciled in the US will be subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares in computing the liability to UK inheritance tax. Conversely, a US citizen who is domiciled or deemed domiciled in the UK will be entitled to a credit for UK inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares in computing the liability for US federal estate tax. Special rules apply where ADSs and ordinary shares are business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise situated in the UK. Table of Contents 176 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Information for shareholders continued US information reporting and backup withholding A US Holder may be subject to US information reporting and backup withholding on dividends paid on or the proceeds of sales of ADSs or ordinary shares made within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries, unless the US Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met. US backup withholding may apply if there has been a notification from the US Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends. Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the US Holders US federal income tax liability, and, where the backup withholding exceeds the actual liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund claim with the US Internal Revenue Service. Certain US Holders who are individuals (and under proposed Treasury regulations, certain entities) may be required to report information relating to securities issued by a non-US person (or foreign accounts through which the securities are held), subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for securities held in accounts maintained by US financial institutions). US Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs. UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the transfer of registered ownership of ordinary shares. Transfers of ordinary shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of 1⁄2% of the consideration given for the transfer with the duty rounded up to the nearest £5. UK stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) arises when there is an agreement to transfer shares in UK companies for consideration in money or moneys worth, and so an agreement to transfer ordinary shares for money or other consideration may give rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of 1⁄2% (rounded up to the nearest penny). The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, if within six years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced to HM Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid. Transfers of ordinary shares into CREST (an electronic transfer system) are exempt from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST who will hold the ordinary shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer is in a form that will ensure that the securities become held in uncertificated form within CREST. Paperless transfers of ordinary shares within CREST for consideration in money or moneys worth are liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty. SDRT on relevant transactions will be collected by CREST at 1⁄2%, and this will apply whether or not the transfer is effected in the UK and whether or not the parties to it are resident or situated in the UK. A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1 1⁄2% of the consideration (or, in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned) will arise on a transfer or issue of ordinary shares to the depositary or to certain persons providing a clearance service (or their nominees or agents) for the conversion into ADRs and will generally be payable by the depositary or person providing clearance service. In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable by the depositary on deposits of ordinary shares will be charged by the depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits. No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that the ADS and any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times outside the UK, and provided further that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the UK (the location of the custodian as a holder of ordinary shares not being relevant in this context). In any other case, any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the circumstances of the transfer, give rise to a charge to stamp duty or SDRT. Table of Contents SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 177 Articles of Association The following summarises certain material rights of holders of the Companys ordinary shares under the material provisions of the Companys Articles of Association and English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act and the Companys Articles of Association. In the following description, a Shareholder is the person registered in the Companys register of members as the holder of an ordinary share. The Company is incorporated under the name Smith & Nephew plc and is registered in England and Wales with registered number 324357. The Companys ordinary shares may be held in certificated or uncertificated form. No holder of the Companys shares will be required to make additional contributions of capital in respect of the Companys shares in the future. In accordance with English law the Companys ordinary shares rank equally. Directors Under the Companys Articles of Association, a Director may not vote in respect of any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal in which he, or any person connected with him, has any material interest other than by virtue of his interests in securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company. This is subject to certain exceptions relating to proposals (a) indemnifying him in respect of obligations incurred on behalf of the Company, (b) indemnifying a third party in respect of obligations of the Company for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity or guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities in which he will be interested as an underwriter, (d) concerning another body corporate in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate, (e) relating to an employee benefit in which the Director will share equally with other employees and (f) relating to any insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (and/or officers) of the Company. A Director shall not vote or be counted in any quorum present at a meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote. The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies borrowed after deducting cash and current asset investments by the Company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed the sum of $6,500,000,000. Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the previous Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director holds office only until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and then shall be eligible for re-election by the Shareholders. The other Directors retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General Meeting after the meeting at which they were last re-appointed. If not re-appointed a Director retiring at a meeting shall retain office until the meeting appoints someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the conclusion of the meeting. The Directors are subject to removal with or without cause by the Board or the Shareholders. Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification. Under the Companys Articles of Association and English law, a Director may be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against liabilities he may sustain or incur in the execution of his duties. Rights attaching to ordinary shares Under English law, dividends are payable on the Companys ordinary shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK and by the Companies Act 2006. Holders of the Companys ordinary shares are entitled to receive final dividends as may be declared by the Directors and approved by the Shareholders in general meeting, rateable according to the amounts paid up on such shares, provided that the dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. The Companys Board of Directors may declare such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified by the Companys financial position. If authorised by an ordinary resolution of the Shareholders, the Board may also direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distribution of specific assets (and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of the Company). Any dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to the Company. There were no material modifications to the rights of Shareholders under the Articles during 2012. Voting rights of ordinary shares Voting at any general meeting of Shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll, which is a written vote, is duly demanded and held. On a show of hands, every Shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. On a poll, every Shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for each ordinary share held by that Shareholder. A poll may be demanded by any of the following:  the chairman of the meeting;  at least five Shareholders present or by proxy entitled to vote on the resolution;  any Shareholder or Shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all Shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution; or  any Shareholder or Shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution on which there have been paid-up sums in aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right. A form of proxy will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one, as above. The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two Shareholders present in person or by proxy carrying the right to vote upon the business to be transacted. Table of Contents 178 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Information for shareholders continued Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the processing and passing of resolutions of which there are two kinds; ordinary or special resolutions:  Ordinary resolutions include resolutions for the re-election of Directors, the approval of financial statements, the declaration of dividends (other than interim dividends), the appointment and re-appointment of auditors or the grant of authority to allot shares. An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at the meetings at which there is a quorum  Special resolutions include resolutions amending the Companys Articles of Association, dis-applying statutory pre-emption rights or changing the Companys name; modifying the rights of any class of the Companys shares at a meeting of the holders of such class or relating to certain matters concerning the Companys winding up. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes of the persons voting at the meeting at which there is a quorum. Annual General Meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of 21 days. Other general meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of at least 14 clear days. The days of delivery or receipt of notice are not included. The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted. Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors. Members with 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company may requisition the Board to convene a meeting. Variation of rights If, at any time, the Companys share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, with the consent in writing of holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all the provisions of the articles of association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be two or more) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class and at any such meeting a poll may be demanded in writing by any person or their proxy who hold shares of that class. Where a person is present by proxy or proxies, he is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxies are authorised to exercise voting rights. Rights in a winding up Except as the Companys Shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon the Companys winding up, the balance of assets available for distribution:  after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors; and  subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares;  is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution is generally to be made in US dollars. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of any extraordinary resolution of the Shareholders and any other sanction required by law, divide among the Shareholders the whole or any part of the Companys assets in kind. Limitations on voting and shareholding There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Companys Articles of Association on the right of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or vote the Companys ordinary shares or ADSs, other than the limitations that would generally apply to all of the Companys Shareholders. Transfers of shares The Board may refuse to register the transfer of shares held in certificated form which:  are not fully paid (provided that it shall not exercise this discretion in such a way as to prevent stock market dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis);  are not duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty, lodged at the Transfer Office or at such other place as the Board may appoint and (save in the case of a transfer by a person to whom no certificate was issued in respect of the shares in question) accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do;  are in respect of more than one class of shares; or  are in favour of more than four transferees. Deferred shares Following the re-denomination of share capital on 23 January 2006 the ordinary shares nominal value became 20 US cents each. There were no changes to the rights or obligations of the ordinary shares. In order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, a new class of sterling shares was created, deferred shares, of which £50,000 were issued and allotted in 2006 as fully paid to the Chief Executive Officer though the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. These deferred shares have no voting or dividend rights and on winding up only are entitled to repayment at nominal value only if all ordinary Shareholders have received the nominal value of their shares plus an additional $1,000 each. Amendments The Company does not have any special rules about amendments to its Articles of Association beyond those imposed by law.
