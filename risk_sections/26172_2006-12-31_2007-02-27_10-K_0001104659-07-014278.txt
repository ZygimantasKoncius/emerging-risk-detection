Business OVERVIEW Cummins Inc. (Cummins, the Company, the registrant, we, our, or us) is a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related component products, including filtration and emissions solutions, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We were founded in 1919 as one of the first manufacturers of diesel engines and are headquartered in Columbus, Indiana. We sell our products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including DaimlerChryslerAG (DaimlerChrysler), PACCAR Inc., International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar International Corporation), Volvo AB, CNH Global N.V., Tata Motors Ltd., Ford, Volkswagen, Dongfeng Motor Company, Komatsu and Scania AB. We serve our customers through a network of more than 550 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,000 dealer locations in more than 160 countries and territories. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels. OEM inventory levels, production schedules, work stoppages and changes in emission standards also impact our sales. Economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reduced sales, which affect our profits and cash flow. We are also subject to substantial government regulation which requires us to make significant investments in capital and research that also impacts our profits and cash flow.

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS We believe the following competitive strengths are instrumental to our success: · Leading Brands. Our product portfolio includes products and services marketed and branded under various trademarks, tradenames and trade dress configurations throughout the world, including each of the following brands, which holds a leading position in its respective market: · Cummins® engines, electric power generation systems, components and parts; · Onan® and Cummins®-Onan® generator sets; · Alternator products sold under the Stamford®, AvK® and Markon® brands; · Fleetguard® filtration systems and components; · Cummins® intake and exhaust systems and components; · KussTM automotive in-tank fuel filtration; · Universal Silencer® filtration systems and silencers; · Holset® turbochargers; · Cummins® Fuel SystemsTM offerings and components; and · Cummins® Emission SolutionsTM aftertreatment solutions and offerings. 4 Our continual investment in and attention to furthering brand equity in our offerings and across our business units includes leveraging and creating brand identity, brand value and brand presence for our offerings in our markets of interest. In particular during 2006, we successfully rebranded our major operating business units to reflect the Cummins name and brand in furtherance of our overall branding strategy. In part, as a result of this investment and by seeking to aggregate brand strength in complementary markets, we also gain recognition in and across our markets for our offerings, continually seek new and innovative means to further develop and expand market share through our brand equity position, and strengthen customer relationships. While our portfolio of branded products and offerings contains a number of market leaders, we operate in a highly competitive sector and our branded offerings compete with the brands offered by other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar offerings. · Customers and Partners. To maintain technology leadership and a global presence in a cost-effective manner, we have established strategic alliances with a number of our leading customers. These partnerships provide us with a knowledge and understanding of our customers technology and business needs, and enable us to develop products and services which better meet their requirements at lower costs. For example, we have both customer and supplier arrangements with Komatsu, Ltd., including manufacturing joint ventures and a product development joint venture through which we have partnered in the development of several engines. We are also the exclusive supplier of engines for Komatsu mining equipment. In addition, we have been the exclusive diesel engine supplier to DaimlerChrysler for its Dodge Ram truck since 1988, and in 2003 our exclusivity agreement was extended beyond model year 2007. We have long-term agreements with Volvo and International Truck and Engine Corporation for the supply of heavy-duty truck engines and PACCAR for the supply of both heavy-duty and medium-duty engines. These agreements afford us long-term price stability and eliminate certain dealer and end-user discounts as well as offer closer integration on product development. We also have multiple international joint ventures which manufacture heavy-duty and midrange engines, including partnerships with Tata Motors Ltd. which is the leading truck manufacturer in India, and Dongfeng Automotive Corporation, an engine supplier to the largest medium-duty truck manufacturer in China. · Global Presence. We have a strong global presence including a worldwide distribution system, manufacturing and engineering facilities around the world and a network of global supply sources. Our worldwide presence has enabled us to take advantage of growth opportunities in international markets, with sales outside the U.S. growing from 43 percent of total consolidated net sales in 2000 to 50 percent of total consolidated net sales in 2006. For over 70 years, we have developed a distribution and service network that includes more than 550 company-owned and independent distributor locations and 5,000 independent dealers located throughout 160 countries and territories. We also have manufacturing operations and product engineering centers around the world, with facilities in the United Kingdom (UK), Brazil, Mexico, Canada, France, Australia, China, India, South Africa, Japan and Singapore. In addition, we have developed a global network of high-quality, low-cost supply sources to support our manufacturing base. · Leading Technology. We have an established reputation for delivering high-quality, technologically advanced products. We continuously work with our customers to develop new products to improve the performance of their vehicles, equipment or systems at competitive cost levels. We are a leader in developing technologies to reduce diesel engine emissions, a key concern of our customers and regulators around the world. We were the first manufacturer to receive a Tier III Certificate of Conformity from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for our QSM off-highway engine that met the January 2005 emissions standards. We were able to meet the EPAs 2007 heavy-duty on-highway emissions standards that went into effect on January 1, 2007 and we announced in January 2007 that our Dodge Ram 6.7-liter Turbo Diesel engine meets the EPAs 2010 emissions 5 standards a full three years ahead of the requirements. We have also developed low-emission, high-performance natural gas engines as an alternative-fuel option for the on-highway, industrial and power generation markets. Our technology leadership in filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, air handling and fuel systems allows us to develop integrated product solutions for the on-highway, off-highway and power generation markets, allowing our customers to use a single high-performance, low-cost system as opposed to multiple components from different suppliers. BUSINESS STRATEGY The five key principles upon which we drive our business strategies are as follows: · Being a Low Cost Producer in as Many of our Markets as Possible. In many of our markets, product or system cost is a critical performance parameter for our customers. To achieve cost leadership, we will continue to leverage our innovative technology, economies of scale, global presence and customer partnerships. We have focused on reducing costs and lowering our breakeven point to maintain a competitive advantage and to deliver quality products to our customers. The following key initiatives are integral to this strategy: · Six Sigma. Since the programs inception in 2000, we have not only applied Six Sigma to manufacturing processes and in the initial design of new products, but also expanded the program to include processes with customers, suppliers and distributors. Six Sigma yields not only significant cost savings and improved quality, it strengthens our relationships with these important stakeholders and contributes to developing long-term relationships. · Global Sourcing. Our cost reduction efforts in supply chain management include global procurement from less expensive international markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe and Brazil which has resulted in significantly reducing the cost of purchased materials and services during the last six years. · Technical Productivity. We have managed our research and development costs through a number of initiatives including a) using analysis-led design to eliminate capital-intensive prototypes through virtual computer modeling, b) performing significant analysis work at our technical center in India, c) applying engineering standards globally and d) with cost-sharing arrangements with OEM customers and joint venture partnerships. Cummins operates 17 technical centers around the world. In August 2006, we further strengthened our engine research and development capability by officially opening our first technical center in central Chinas Wuhan City. These initiatives have helped us to continue to be a technology leader, while maintaining our research and engineering expense at approximately 2.8 percent of consolidated net sales for 2006. · Expanding into Related Markets. We will continue to focus growth initiatives in related businesses where we can use our existing investments in products or technology, leading brand name or market presence to establish a competitive advantage. That focus is particularly on ventures that complement our existing businesses by being less capital-intensive and less cyclical or counter-cyclical to our core businesses, for example, the production of light-duty diesel engines in an existing Cummins facility that will introduce us to a new consumer customer base. Furthermore, we will target related markets that offer higher rates of growth, attractive returns and more stable cash flows through product and end market diversity. Specific growth opportunities are outlined below. · Our Engine segment strategy includes the development of light-duty diesel engines for the SUV/light duty pick-up truck and industrial markets both in the U.S. and in China. In addition, our strategy includes the development of high horsepower engines for the growing oil and gas and marine markets. 6 · Our Power Generation strategy is focused on attaining leadership positions in all major commercial generator set markets globally, including growth in market share in European, Middle Eastern and African markets and penetration gains in power electronics and controls, such as automatic transfer switches and switchgear. The business is also pursuing growth opportunities in adjacent markets for consumer generator sets, including towable trailers, portable generator sets, auxiliary power units and residential generator sets. · Our Components segment will leverage our filtration, exhaust, fuel systems, turbocharger and engine technologies to provide integrated solutions for its customers and meet increasingly stringent emissions requirements. · Our Distribution segment is growing through the expansion of the aftermarket parts and service business by capitalizing on its global customer base and fast growth markets in China, India and Russia as well as the Middle East. Our strategy also includes increasing our ownership interest in key portions of the distribution channel. · Creating Greater Shareholder Value. Return on equity is a primary measure of our consolidated financial performance. We report the performance of our operating segments based on segment EBIT. Segment EBIT is earnings before interest expense, taxes and minority interests. · Leveraging Complementary Businesses. Strong synergies and relationships exist between our operating segments in the following areas: · Shared Technology. In addition to common platforms of base product technology, our operating segments have technical capabilities which can be applied commercially to provide integrated solutions for our customers. The operating segments also realize synergies in the development and application of broader technology tools (such as information technology). · Common Channels and Distribution. All operating segments utilize a common distribution channel, which provides access to a full range of our products and also provides economies of scale. · Shared Customers and Partners. There is substantial commonality in customers and partners between operating segments, which allows us to build strong customer relationships and provides opportunity for expanded product offerings. · Corporate Brand and Image. All operating segments benefit from the established and respected corporate brand. · Creating the Right Environment for Success. We believe that creating the right environment for success means creating an inclusive learning environment, while reinforcing a performance ethic that attracts, develops and retains high-quality talent. We measure our success through skill and competency assessment, leadership development outcomes and participation in tailored individual development and training programs. OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate four complementary operating segments that share technology, customers, strategic partners, brands and our distribution network to gain a competitive advantage in their respective markets. With our size and global presence, we provide world-class products, service and support to our customers in a cost-effective manner. In each of our operating segments, we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. 7 We made certain leadership changes effective May 2, 2005, within our management team. In connection with these changes, certain modifications were made to our internal reporting. These modifications are summarized below: · The Filtration and Other segment was renamed the Components segment and now includes operating results of the fuel systems business which were previously included in the Engine segment. Historically, the fuel systems business transferred product within the Engine segment at cost. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, those transfers began using a cost-plus based transfer price. As a result of this change, segment EBIT increased for the Components segment and decreased for the Engine segment but there was no impact to consolidated earnings. Revenues of the Components segment were also increased to reflect transfers to the Engine segment and eliminations were increased by a corresponding amount. · The North American distribution business was combined with the International Distribution segment and renamed the Distribution segment. Previously, the North American distribution business was reported in the Engine and Power Generation segments as investee equity and included the results of a partially-owned distributor that is consolidated. As a result, revenues of the Engine segment were increased to reflect sales to the consolidated distributor that were previously eliminated and decreased for the revenues of the consolidated distributor which are now included in the Distribution segment. In addition, this change also caused investee equity earnings in the Engine and Power Generation segments to decrease while investee equity earnings in the Distribution segment increased by a corresponding amount. Engine Segment Our Engine segment manufactures and markets a broad range of diesel and natural gas-powered engines under the Cummins brand name for the heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive, agricultural, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, rail and governmental equipment markets. We offer a wide variety of engine products with displacement from 1.4 to 91 liters and horsepower ranging from 31 to 3,500. In addition, we provide a full range of new parts and service, as well as remanufactured parts and engines, through our extensive distribution network. The Engine segment is our largest operating segment, accounting for approximately 55 percent of total sales before intersegment eliminations in 2006. The principal customers of our heavy-and medium-duty truck engines include truck manufacturers, such as International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar International Corporation), Volvo Trucks North America, PACCAR and Freightliner. CNH Komatsu, Hitachi, Ingersoll Rand and Brunswick represent manufacturers of construction, agricultural and marine equipment to whom we sell our industrial engines. The principal customers of our light-duty on-highway engines are DaimlerChrysler and manufacturers of RVs.

These competitors vary by geographical location. 12 SEGMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION Financial information about our operating segments is incorporated by reference from Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. SUPPLY We have developed and maintain a world-class supply base in terms of technology, quality and cost. We source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. We have adequate sources of supply of raw materials and components. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units, including blocks, heads, rods, turbochargers, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, exhaust systems, alternators and fuel systems. We also have arrangements with certain suppliers who are the sole source for specific products or supply items. Between 75 and 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchases in 2006 were purchased from suppliers who are the sole source of supply for a particular supply item. Although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers, the majority of these supply items can be purchased from alternate suppliers with the appropriate lead-time and sourcing plan. In 2006, we established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk. We are also developing suppliers in many global or low-cost locations to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers. In addition, we maintain dual sourcing at a commodity level on many of our sole sourced part numbers. Our supply agreements vary according to the particular part number sourced. However, these agreements typically include standard terms relating to cost (including cost reduction targets), quality and delivery. Our supply agreements also typically include customary intellectual property provisions that contain prohibitions on the use of our intellectual property by the suppliers for any purpose other than their performance of the supply agreements, and indemnity covenants from suppliers for breach by them of intellectual property rights of third parties in performance of the agreements. The duration of our more important supply agreements varies but typically ranges between three and five years. Many of our supply agreements include early termination provisions related to failure to meet quality and delivery requirements. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These have been granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents, or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is considered significant in relation to our business. SEASONALITY While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis. However, our Power Generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter of the fiscal year due to general declines in construction spending and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia. LARGEST CUSTOMER We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. DaimlerChrysler is our largest customer, accounting for approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2006, primarily relating to sales of our ISB engine for use in 13 Dodge Ram trucks and sales of our heavy- and medium-duty truck engines to the Freightliner division of DaimlerChrysler. While a significant number of our sales to DaimlerChrysler are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for the supply of DaimlerChryslers engine requirements for particular vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of DaimlerChrysler vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have been an engine supplier to DaimlerChrysler for nearly 20 years and to Freightliner for well over 50 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion. In addition to our agreements with DaimlerChrysler, we have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with International Truck and Engine Corporation, PACCAR and Volvo Trucks North America. Collectively, our net sales to these three customers was less than 19 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 and individually, was less than 9 percent of consolidated net sales for each customer. As with DaimlerChrysler, these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. There are no guarantees or commitments by these customers of any kind regarding volumes or market shares, except in the case of DaimlerChrysler, which has committed that Cummins will be its exclusive diesel engine supplier for the Dodge Ram heavy-duty pickup truck. Agreements with OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party. BACKLOG Demand in many of our markets has grown rapidly in the last two years resulting in longer lead times. However, while we have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm. DISTRIBUTION For over 70 years, we have been developing a distribution and service network that includes more than 550 independent distributor locations and 5,000 independent dealers in 160 countries and territories. In North America, this network is comprised of independent and partially-owned distributors. Internationally, our network consists of independent, partially-owned, and wholly-owned distributors. Most distributors sell the full range of our products, as well as complementary products and services. Our Distribution segment operates within this network with 17 company-owned distributors and 12 joint ventures in approximately 270 locations in over 90 countries and territories. Our licensing agreements with independent and partially-owned distributors generally have a three-year term and are restricted to specified territories. Our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship. The distributors are permitted to sell other, noncompetitive products only with our consent. We license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products, with no right to assign or sublicense the marks, except to authorized dealers, without our consent. Products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices, as applicable. Net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales. Subject to local laws, we can refuse to renew these agreements at will, and we may terminate them upon 90-day notice for inadequate sales, change in principal ownership and certain other reasons. Distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60-day notice without cause, or 30-day notice for cause. Upon termination or failure to renew, we 14 may be required to purchase the distributors current inventory and may, at our option purchase other assets of the distributor, but are under no obligation to do so. Our distribution capability is a key element of our business strategy and competitive position, particularly in our efforts to increase customer access to aftermarket replacement parts and repair service. There are more than 5,000 locations in North America, primarily owned and operated by OEMs or their dealers, at which Cummins trained service personnel and parts are available to service, maintain and repair our engines. We also have parts distribution centers located strategically throughout the world in order to serve our customers and distributors. Financial information about wholly-owned distributors, partially-owned distributors consolidated under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference from Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING Our research and engineering program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. In 2006, our research and engineering expenditures were $321 million compared to $278 million in 2005. Of this amount, approximately 19 percent, or $62 million, was directly related to the development of heavy-duty and medium-duty engines that are designed to comply with the 2007 emissions standards with approximately $10 million directly related to compliance with 2010 emissions standards. In the Engine segment, we continue to invest in system integration and in technologies to meet increasingly more stringent emissions standards. We have focused our engine technology development on four critical subsystems: combustion, air handling, electronic controls and exhaust aftertreatment. We were the first engine manufacturer to announce a low-cost combustion-only emission solution for Tier III industrial diesel engines that does not require exhaust gas recirculation nor exhaust aftertreatment. We were able to meet the EPAs 2007 heavy-duty on-highway emissions standards that went into effect on January 1, 2007 and we announced in January 2007 that our 6.7-liter Dodge Ram Turbo Diesel engine meets the EPAs 2010 emissions standards a full three years ahead of the requirements. In addition, we were the first company to demonstrate a prototype vehicle that meets EPA 2007 gasoline-equivalent Tier II Bin 5 emission levels. In Power Generation, our product engineering focus is to develop products with the best performance at the lowest cost for our customers. Our power electronics technology development is aimed at applying digital electronics to eliminate multiple genset controllers and achieve higher levels of system integration and control. We meet the most advanced emission standards around the world, employing both combustion and exhaust aftertreatment technologies. Looking to future low-emission power generation technologies, we have a Department of Energy funded program to develop a solid oxide fuel cell system for vehicle auxiliary power generation and for smaller stationary power generation applications. In Components, we are building on our strengths in design integration to develop modules that integrate multiple filtration functions into a single engine subsystem component. We are developing new filter media and technologies that support low-emission engines, including exhaust aftertreatment, closed crankcase ventilation, fuel systems and centrifugal soot removal. In 2003, we established Cummins Research and Technology India Private Ltd. (CRTI). This partially-owned subsidiary provides analytical services such as structural dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, and design to all Cummins entities. CRTI is located in Pune, India. In August 2006, our first technical center in China was opened in Wuhan City. The East Asia Technical Center, a 55-45 joint venture between Cummins and Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company Limited (DCEC), provides engineering and technical 15 development services for the full range of Cummins products built in China, including diesel and natural gas engines, power generators, turbochargers and filtration products. A series of projects has already started in the technical center, including the development of a new 13-liter engine platform for the heavy-duty truck market served by DCEC. JOINT VENTURES AND ALLIANCES We have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners and affiliates in various areas of the world to increase our market penetration, expand our product lines, streamline our supply chain management and develop new technologies with the primary joint ventures being the following: · Cummins India Ltd. We are the majority owner of Cummins India Ltd. (CIL), which is a publicly listed company on various exchanges in India. This business entity developed from a partnership established in 1962 with the Kirloskar family. CIL produces midrange, heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines, as well as generators for the Indian and export markets. CIL also produces compressed natural gas spark-ignited engines licensed from the Cummins Westport (CWI) joint venture. We consolidate the results of Cummins India Ltd. in our Consolidated Financial Statements. · Consolidated Diesel Company. Consolidated Diesel Company, located in the U.S., is a joint venture with CNH Global N.V. that began with Case Corporation in 1980. This partnership produces Cummins B Series, C Series and ISL Series engines and engine products for on-highway and industrial markets in North America and Europe. Effective March 28, 2004, we adopted the provisions of FIN 46R for this entity and its results are now consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). · Cummins/Komatsu Arrangements. We have formed a broad relationship with Komatsu Ltd., including four joint ventures and numerous exclusive supply arrangements. Two joint ventures were formed in 1992, one to manufacture Cummins B Series engines in Japan, the other to build high-horsepower Komatsu-designed engines in the U.S., Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC). In 1997, we established a third joint venture in Japan to design the next generation of industrial engines. Our fourth joint venture is a distributor joint venture in Chile. Effective March 28, 2004, we adopted the provisions of FIN 46R for CKEC and its results are now consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 16 · Cummins/Dongfeng Joint Ventures. In 1985, we licensed Dongfeng Motor Company (Dongfeng), the largest medium-duty truck manufacturer in China, to manufacture Cummins B Series engines. In 1993, Dongfeng established a subsidiary, Dongfeng Automotive Corporation (DFAC), which became the licensee. In 1995, we partnered with DFAC and formed a joint venture, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC), for the production of our C Series engines. In 1998, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Cummins (Xiangfan) Machining Company Ltd. (CXMC), in an adjacent facility to DCEC to manufacture B Series cylinder blocks and cylinder heads. In April 2003, the assets of DFACs B Series manufacturing entity and the assets of CXMC were invested into the existing joint venture, DCEC. The expanded joint venture, with annual capacity of approximately 170,000 units, produces Cummins B, C and L Series four-to nine-liter mechanical engines and began producing full-electronic diesel engines with a power range from 100 to 370 horsepower in 2006. In 2004, Cummins invested a B Series connecting rod machining line into CXMC to supply DCEC. We also have a joint venture with Dongfeng that manufactures filtration systems, Shanghai Fleetguard Filter Co., Ltd and in 2005 expanded the relationship to include exhaust systems. In 2003, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. acquired 50 percent ownership of Dongfeng. In August 2006, our first technical center in China was opened in Wuhan City. The East Asia Technical Center, a 55-45 consolidated joint venture between Cummins and DCEC, provides engineering and technical development services for the full range of Cummins products built in China, including diesel and natural gas engines, power generators, turbochargers and filtration products. A series of projects has already started in the technical center, including the development of a new 13-liter engine platform for the heavy-duty truck market served by DCEC. In late 2005, the Cummins Westport (CWI) joint venture engaged DCEC to produce the CWI natural gas engines in China. · Tata Group Joint Ventures. In 1992, we formed a joint venture with Tata Motors Ltd., the largest automotive company in India and a member of the Tata group of companies. The joint venture, Tata Cummins Limited, manufactures the Cummins B Series engine in India for use in trucks manufactured by Tata Motors, as well as for various Cummins industrial and power generation applications. Cummins Turbo Technologies Ltd., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, also formed a joint venture for the manufacture of turbochargers, Tata Holset Ltd. · Chongqing Cummins. In 1995, we formed a joint venture with China National Heavy-Duty Truck Corporation in Chongqing, China. The shares of this venture are now owned jointly by us and the Chongqing Heavy Duty Vehicle Group. The joint venture, Chongqing Cummins Engine Company Ltd. (CCEC), manufactures several models of our heavy-duty and high-horsepower diesel engines in China, serving primarily the industrial and stationary power markets in China. · Shaanxi/Cummins. In 2005, we formed the Xian Cummins Engine Company (XCEC) joint venture with Shaanxi Heavy Vehicle Group Co., and Shaanxi Heavy Duty Truck Co., Ltd. in Xian, China. The joint venture will begin to manufacture in 2007 the Cummins ISM heavy-duty diesel engine for use in Shaanxi trucks and for sale to outside customers. · The European Engine Alliance (EEA). The EEA was established in 1996 as a joint venture between our Company and two Fiat Group companies, Iveco N.V. (trucks and buses) and CNH Global (agricultural and construction equipment), to develop a new generation of 4, 5 and 6-liter engines based on our 4B and 6B Series engines. · Cummins/Scania Joint Ventures. In 1999, we formed a joint venture with Scania to produce fuel systems for heavy-duty diesel engines. We own 70 percent of this joint venture and its results are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2005, we signed a joint venture agreement with Scania to produce the next generation fuel systems for heavy-duty on-highway 17 trucks. This joint venture, Cummins-Scania XPI Manufacturing LLP, is a 50/50 joint venture that builds upon other Cummins-Scania partnerships. · Cummins/Westport Joint Venture. In 2001, we formed a joint venture with Westport Innovations Inc., located in British Columbia, Canada, to develop and market low-emissions, high-performance natural gas engines for on-highway, industrial and power generation markets. In 2003, the joint venture agreement was modified to focus the joint ventures efforts on the marketing and sale of automotive spark-ignited natural gas engines worldwide. The new agreement also provides for joint technology projects between Westport and Cummins on low-emission technologies of mutual interest. · Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine LLC. In 2002, we formed a joint venture with Mercury Marine, a division of Brunswick Corporation, to develop, manufacture and sell recreational marine diesel products, including engines, sterndrive packages, inboard packages, instrument and controls, service systems and replacement and service parts and assemblies, complete integration systems and other related products. · ZAO Cummins Kama. In January 2006, we signed a joint venture agreement with KAMAZ Inc., the largest vehicle manufacturer in Russia, to produce B Series engines under the name ZAO Cummins Kama. The joint venture will build on the Cummins and KAMAZ relationship that dates back to the early 1980s. Among the customers of the new company are KAMAZ trucks and buses, as well as trucks, buses and agricultural equipment produced by other manufacturers in Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine. · Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company. In October 2006, we signed an agreement with Beiqi Foton Motor Company to form a 50/50 joint venture, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company (BFCEC), to produce two families of Cummins light-duty, high performance diesel engines in Beijing. The engines will be used in light-duty commercial trucks, pickup trucks, multipurpose and sport utility vehicles. Certain types of marine, small construction equipment and industrial applications will also be served by this engine family. Cummins and Beiqi Foton will initially invest a combined $126 million into BFCEC, which is scheduled to begin production in 2008. The parties are awaiting approval of the joint venture by the Chinese government. In addition to these primary joint ventures and agreements, we also have equity interests in several of our North American distributors who distribute the full range of our products and services to customers and end-users. We have also entered into numerous joint ventures around the world where we provide engine components, such as turbochargers, alternators and filtration products. In Turkey, we have a license agreement with BMC Sanayi that provides for the manufacture and sale of our B and C Series engines. We will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets, develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies. Financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial information about geographic areas is incorporated by reference from Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 34,600 persons worldwide. 18 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE Product Environmental Compliance Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise. Our products comply with emissions standards that the EPA, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other state regulatory agencies, as well as other regulatory agencies around the world, have established for heavy-duty on-highway diesel and gas engines and off-highway engines produced through 2006. Our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results. EPA Engine Certifications In the fourth quarter of 2002, we implemented new on-road emissions standards. These were implemented in accordance with the terms of a 1998 consent decree that we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and CARB. The consent decree also required us to pull forward by one year (to January 1, 2005) the implementation of Tier III emissions standards for off-road engines in the 300 to 749 horsepower range. Sales of these engines commenced January 1, 2005. The consent decree was in response to concerns raised by these agencies regarding the level of nitrogen oxide emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines. On December 15, 2006, we were notified by the EPA that the consent decree provisions relating to certification of on-highway engines have been terminated, indicating our successful completion of that portion of the consent decree. Certain other requirements of the consent decree continue and are on course to terminate within deadlines. Federal and California regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissions-related components to the EPA and CARB when the failure rate reaches a specified level. At higher failure rates, a product recall may be required. In 2006, we submitted 46 reports to the EPA relating to 24 different defects affecting EGR valves, turbochargers and a minor mathematical change to the calibration algorithm. None of these defects resulted in a campaign of a material nature. Emissions standards in international markets, including Europe and Japan, are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting U.S. emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows. New on-highway emissions standards came into effect in the U.S. on January 1, 2007. In December 2003, we announced that we would meet the 2007 U.S. EPA heavy-duty on-highway emissions standards by combining our existing cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) technology with particulate matter (PM) filters. Cooled EGR is the same technology that we have used since April 2002 and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as NOx adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel combine to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the U.S. Additionally, while we believe the EGR/PM filter combination is the right solution for 2007 in the U.S., we have selected SCR as the right technology to meet on-highway Euro IV emissions standards and certain off-highway applications. Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations. During the last five years, expenditures for environmental control activities and 19 environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a substantial portion of annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2007. Pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at approximately 17 waste disposal sites. Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites. Item 1A. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report. In addition, future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting rules, general U.S. and non-U.S. economic and political conditions, including a global economic slow-down, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section in Item 7 below, Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, should be considered in addition to the following statements. Our business is affected by the cyclical nature of the markets we serve. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets and geographies that we serve. Demand in these markets and geographies fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels. Our sales are also impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products, which could reduce future earnings and cash flow. Our products are subject to substantial government regulation. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as the CARB, and other regulatory agencies around the world. In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. For example, we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emissions standards by January 1, 2007. While we were able to meet this deadline, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. Currently, we believe we are on schedule to meet all deadlines for known future regulatory standards. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards. Further, the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products are subject to risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties. Any failure to comply with regulatory standards affecting our products could subject us to fines or penalties, and could require us to cease production of any non-compliant engine or to recall any engines produced and sold in violation of the applicable 20 standards. See BusinessEnvironmental ComplianceProduct Environmental Compliance for a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that affect our products. Our products are subject to recall for performance related issues. We are at risk for product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Costs typically include the cost of the product, part or component being replaced, customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part or component. When a recall decision is made, we estimate the cost of the recall and record a charge to earnings in that period in accordance with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this estimate, judgment is required as to the quantity or volume to be recalled, the total cost of the recall campaign, the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and, in some cases, the extent to which the supplier of the part or component will share in the recall cost. As a result, these estimates are subject to change. We cannot assure that our truck manufacturers and OEM customers will continue to outsource their engine supply needs. Several of our engine customers, including Paccar, Navistar, Volvo and DaimlerChrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emissions capability, systems integration, their customers preference and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine production in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our largest customer accounts for a significant share of our business. Sales to DaimlerChrysler accounted for approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2006, primarily relating to sales of our ISB engine for use in the Dodge Ram truck and sales of our heavy-and medium-duty truck engines to its Freightliner division. While a significant amount of our sales to DaimlerChrysler are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for the supply of DaimlerChryslers engine requirements for particular models and not a specific number of engines. Accordingly, the loss of DaimlerChrysler as a customer or a significant decline in the production levels for the vehicles in which DaimlerChrysler uses our products would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages. We obtain materials and manufactured components from third-party suppliers. A significant number of our suppliers representing 75 to 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchasers in 2006 are the sole source for a particular supply item, although the majority of these materials and components can be obtained from other suppliers. Any delay in our suppliers abilities to provide us with necessary materials and components may affect our capabilities at a number of our manufacturing locations, or may require us to seek alternative supply sources. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of 21 factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters. As of December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 34,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 13,500 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements with various unions that expire between 2007 and 2011. While we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters, we cannot assure that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers could result in slow-downs or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines are installed. If one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our products involve risks of exposure to product liability claims. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specifications results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and cash flows. In addition, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, and the amount of such liability could be material. 22 We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Approximately 50 percent of our net sales for 2006 were attributable to customers outside the United States. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include: · the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; · trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; · tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the United States and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings; · the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; · difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations; · required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and · changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse affect on our international operations or on our business as a whole. We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our earnings. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks, we cannot assure that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. Actions of this nature, if they occur or continue for significant periods of time, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in any given period. We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies. Any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For a more complete 23 discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see BusinessOur Operating Segments. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
