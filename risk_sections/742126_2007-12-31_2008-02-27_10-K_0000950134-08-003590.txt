Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. A significant portion of our business depends upon non-recurring event clean-up projects over which we have no control. A significant portion of our disposal revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business which varies widely in size and duration. For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately 54% of our treatment and disposal revenues were derived from Event Business projects. The one-time nature of Event Business necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability is further influenced by funding availability, changes in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions, public controversy, litigation, weather, property redevelopment plans and other factors. As a result of this variability, we can experience significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year volatility in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and net income. Also, while many large projects are identifiable years in advance, both large and small project opportunities also routinely arise with little prior notice. This uncertainty, which is inherent to the business, is factored into our budgeting and externally communicated business projections. For example, approximately one quarter of our 2008 revenue budget is comprised of unknown new Event and Base business. Our budgeting process combines historical experience with identified sales pipeline opportunities and planned initiatives for new or expanded service lines. A reduction in the number and size of new clean-up projects won to replace completed work could result in a material adverse affect on our business. The loss of one or more significant customers or contracts could adversely affect our profitability. Honeywell and the USACE are under multiple year contracts which accounted for approximately 41% and 6% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, respectively. Honeywell and USACE have contracts with us to provide waste services through 2009. In October 2005, Honeywell stopped shipments and also filed a motion in U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey to reduce the amount of material removed from the site. This motion was unsuccessful and Honeywell shipments resumed in April 2006. Shipments have continued at expected levels since that time. The Honeywell Jersey City project is estimated to ship approximately 1.2 million tons of waste to our Grand View, Idaho facility through November 2009. As of December 31, 2007, we have disposed of approximately 50% of the total estimated waste under this contract. While we believe that the USACE will contract for our services for the duration of the Formerly Utilized Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) through 2016 and potentially beyond, this cannot be assured. Our contract with the USACE does not guarantee any funding beyond project-specific task orders. Reduced appropriations for the USACE and other government clean-up work or a reduction in project-specific task orders under present appropriation levels could have a material adverse affect on our business. Reduced funding and the loss of these or other large contracts combined with failure to replace them with similar contracts could significantly reduce our revenue resulting in a material adverse affect on our results of operations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations our business could be adversely affected. The changing regulatory framework governing our business creates significant risks. We could be held liable if our operations cause contamination of air, groundwater or soil. Under current law, we may be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. Also, we may be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination at facilities operated by others, or if a predecessor made such arrangements and we are a successor. Liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Stringent government regulations of federal, state and local governments have a substantial impact on our business. Many complex, laws rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Failure to obtain on a timely basis or comply with applicable 13 Table of Contents federal, state and local governmental licenses, permits or approvals for our waste treatment and disposal facilities could prevent or restrict our ability to provide certain services, resulting in a potentially significant loss of revenue and earnings. Changes in environmental regulations may require us to make significant capital or other expenditures. Changes in laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations may require us to modify existing operating licenses or permits, or obtain additional approvals. New governmental requirements that raise compliance standards or require changes in operating practices or technology may impose significant costs. Our revenues are primarily generated as a result of requirements imposed on our customers under federal and state laws, and regulations to protect public health and the environment. If requirements to comply with laws and regulations governing management of PCB, hazardous or radioactive waste were relaxed or less vigorously enforced, demand for our services could materially decrease and our revenues and earnings could be significantly reduced. We may not be able to obtain timely or cost effective transportation services which could adversely affect our profitability. Revenue at each of our facilities is subject to potential risks from disruptions in rail or truck transportation services relied upon to deliver waste to our facilities. Increases in fuel costs and unforeseen events such as strikes, public health pandemics, natural disasters and other acts of God, war, or terror could prevent or delay shipments and reduce both volumes and revenue. Our rail transportation service agreements with our customers generally allow us to pass on fuel surcharges assessed by the railroads, which minimize our exposure to fuel cost increases. Transportation services may be limited by economic conditions, including increased demand for rail or trucking services, resulting in periods of slower service to the point that individual customer needs cannot be met. No assurance can be given that we can procure transportation services in a timely manner at competitive rates. Such factors could also limit our ability to implement our plans to increase revenue and earnings. If we are unable to obtain at a reasonable cost the necessary levels of insurance and financial assurances required for operations, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. We are required by law, license, permit, and prudence to maintain various insurance instruments and financial assurances. We carry a broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a company of our size in our business. We use these coverages to mitigate risk of loss, allowing us to manage our self-insured exposure from potential claims. We are self-insured for employee health-care coverage. Stop-loss insurance is carried covering liability on claims in excess of $125,000 per individual or on an aggregate basis for the monthly population. Accrued costs related to the self-insured health care coverage were $184,000 and $170,000 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also maintain a Pollution and Remediation Legal Liability Policy pursuant to RCRA regulations subject to a $250,000 self-insured retention. In addition, we are insured for consultants environmental liability subject to a $100,000 self-insured retention. We are also insured for losses or damage to third party property or people subject to a $75,000 self-insured retention. To the extent our insurances were unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial condition and results of operation. Through December 31, 2007, we have met our financial assurance requirements through insurance. Our current closure and post-closure policies were renewed in December 2005 and expire in December 2009. This renewal required us to self-fund $4.5 million of non-operating site closure and post-closure liability and provide collateral equal to 15% of financial assurance through the term of the policy. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. While we expect to continue renewing these policies, if we were unable to obtain adequate closure, post-closure or environmental insurance in the future, any partially or completely uninsured claim against us, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, continued access to casualty and pollution legal liability insurance with sufficient limits, at acceptable terms, is important to obtaining new business. Failure to maintain adequate financial assurance could also result in regulatory action including early closure of facilities. As of December 31, 2007, we have provided collateral of $4.9 million in funded trust agreements and issued $4.0 million in letters of credit for financial assurance insurance policies of approximately $32 million for closure and post- 14 Table of Contents closure obligations. While we believe we will be able to maintain the requisite financial assurance policies at a reasonable cost, premium and collateral requirements may materially increase. Such increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations. Loss of key management or sales personnel could harm our business. We have an experienced management team and rely on the continued service of our senior managers to achieve our objectives. We also have a senior sales team with industry experience averaging over 15 years. Our objective is to retain our present management and sales teams and identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of any key management employee or sales personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our market is highly competitive. Failure to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We face competition from companies with much greater resources, service offerings we do not provide and potentially lower pricing. An increase in the number of commercial treatment or disposal facilities for hazardous or radioactive waste in the United States, or a decrease in the treatment or disposal fees charged by competitors could negatively affect our results of operations. Our business is also heavily affected by waste tipping fees imposed by government agencies. These fees, which vary from state to state, are periodically adjusted. While no adjustment plans are presently known, future changes may significantly impact the competitive environment in which we conduct our business. The hazardous and radioactive waste industry in which we operate is subject to litigation risk. The handling of radioactive, PCBs and hazardous materials subjects us to potential liability claims by employees, contractors, property owners and others. There can be no assurance that our existing liability insurance is adequate to cover claims asserted against us or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future. Adverse rulings in legal matters could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions, government funding or competitive pressures affecting our customers could harm our business. We serve oil refineries, chemical production plants, steel mills, waste broker-aggregators serving small manufacturers and other customers that are, or may be, affected by changing economic conditions and competition. These customers may curtail waste production and/or delay spending on plant maintenance, waste clean-up work and other discretionary work. Market forces may also compel customers to cease operations or relocate to other countries, which could adversely affect our business. Also, approximately 6% of our total 2007 revenue was generated from the USACE. The USACE has entered into a long-term disposal contract with us that expires in 2009. While multi-year USACE projects may continue under the contract beyond 2009, the contract does not guarantee any funding beyond assigned project-specific task orders or a follow-on contract for projects first awarded after 2009. Failure to secure new USACE task orders or a new contract vehicle for post-2009 projects or reduced appropriations for the USACE and other government clean-up work requiring our services could have a material adverse affect on our business. Our operations are significantly affected by the commencement and completion of both large and multiple, smaller clean-up projects; potential seasonal fluctuations due to weather; budgetary decisions influencing the timing of customer spending for remedial activities; the timing of regulatory agency decisions and judicial proceedings; changes in regulations and other factors that may delay or cause the cancellation of clean-up projects. We do not control such factors, which can cause our revenue and income to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 15 Table of Contents If we are unable to obtain timely regulatory approvals to construct additional disposal space by the time our current disposal capacity is exhausted, our business would be adversely affected. Construction of new disposal capacity at our operating disposal facilities sites beyond currently permitted capacity requires state regulatory agency approvals. While we have historically been successful in receiving timely approvals for proposed disposal facility expansions, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining future expansion approvals in a timely manner or at all. Our business requires the handling of dangerous substances. Improper handling of such substances could result in an adverse impact on our business. We are subject to unexpected occurrences related, or unrelated, to the routine handling of dangerous substances. A fire or other incident, such as the fire in 2004 in our Robstown, Texas waste treatment building, could impair one or more facilities from performing normal operations. This could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Improper handling of these substances could also violate laws and regulations resulting in a fines and/or suspension of operations. Failure to perform under our contracts may adversely harm our business. Certain contracts, including our Honeywell Jersey City project contract, require us to meet specified performance criteria. Our ability to meet these criteria requires that we expend significant resources. If we or our subcontractors are unable to perform as required, we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties and/or loss of the affected contracts. We may not be able or willing to pay future dividends. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to our future financial condition and certain conditions such as continued compliance with bank covenants. Our Board of Directors must also approve any dividends at their sole discretion. Pursuant to our credit agreement, we may only declare quarterly or annual dividends if on the date of declaration no event of default has occurred, no other event or condition that upon notice or continuation would constitute a default, and payment of the dividend will not result in a default. Unforeseen events or situations could cause non-compliance with these bank covenants, or cause the Board of Directors to discontinue or reduce dividend payment. Integration of potential acquisitions may impose substantial costs and delays and cause other unanticipated adverse impacts. Acquisitions involve multiple risks. Our inability to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business into our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. These risks include but are not limited to:  the need to spend substantial operational, financial and management resources integrating new businesses, technologies and processes and related difficulties integrating the operations, personnel or systems of the acquired business;  retention of key personnel and customers of the acquired business;  impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets; and  environmental and other liabilities associated with past operations of acquired business.
