Risk Factors Brand Integrity Because we position the Cutter & Buck brand to consistently represent high-quality premium-branded apparel that is available at select locations, maintaining the integrity of the Cutter & Buck brand is essential to our business. We regard our name and logo as valuable assets, and critical to marketing our products based on our brand image. Leading brands in the apparel industry have historically been subject to competition from imitators that infringe the trademarks and trade dress of the brand. Although we do not believe we have been materially harmed by infringement of our trademarks or trade dress to date, we have experienced some instances of such infringement and have taken actions to protect our rights. If we are unable to successfully defend the integrity of our brand, our business may be materially harmed. Design The success of Cutter & Buck is dependant on our ability to offer styles that please consumer tastes for color, styles, and fabrics. If we misjudge these tastes, we could experience insufficient or excess inventory levels, missed market opportunities, or higher markdowns. We are working towards becoming faster at bringing new products to market. Inventory Management Due to long lead times in the apparel industry that result from the seasonal characteristics of our business, customer delivery schedules, and the shipping time from factories to our distribution center, which is generally four to six weeks, sales forecasting and inventory planning are of paramount importance. Our ability to continue to satisfy our Corporate customers is partially due to our ability to meet their needs on demand. In order to meet the unique needs of all our distribution channels, the Company generally maintains inventory balances of approximately four to five months of sales. If we are unable to accurately forecast our sales or plan for appropriate levels of inventories, it may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Overseas Production We have not experienced any material difficulties as a result of foreign political, economic, or social instability, however we remain subject to the risks associated with foreign suppliers, including, without limitation, economic, political, and health risks. We may experience delays in shipping from time to time, whether due to third-party strikes or otherwise. Delays in shipments and other factors beyond our control could materially harm our relationships with our customers, our reputation in the industry, and our financial condition and operating results. Key Employees Because we position the Cutter & Buck brand to represent high-quality, premium-branded apparel, coupled with superior customer service, we rely on key employees in various areas of our operations. We also operate on a strict seasonal merchandise calendar that includes personnel from our design, product development, production, and sales groups. If we were to experience the loss of key employees in the future without orderly succession, our business might be harmed. 6 Available Information Copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and proxy statements and information, as well as any amendments thereto, are available free of charge via the CompanyÂ’s website, www.cutterbuck.com.
