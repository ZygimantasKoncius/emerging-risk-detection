Risk Factors  Current Market and Economic Conditions May Significantly Affect Our Operations and Financial Condition. Second Mortgage and Equity Loans. We also offer second mortgage and equity loans and home equity lines of credit, each of which are secured by one- to four-family residences, substantially all of which are located in our primary market area. At June 30, 2010, second mortgage and equity loans totaled $48.1 million, or 3.1% of total loans. Additionally, at June 30, 2010, the unadvanced amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $39.3 million. The underwriting standards utilized for home equity loans and equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicants credit history, an assessment of the applicants ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The combined (first and second mortgage liens) loan-to-value ratio for home equity loans and equity lines of credit is generally limited to 80%. Home equity loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rates of interest and with terms of up to 30 years. Our home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest which are indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal. Equity loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly if they are secured by an asset that has a superior security interest. In addition, equity loan collections depend on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Construction Loans. We originate construction loans for the development of one- to four-family residential properties located in our primary market area. Residential construction loans are generally offered to experienced local developers operating in our primary market area and to individuals for the construction of their personal residences. At June 30, 2010, residential construction loans amounted to $43.4 million, or 2.8% of total loans. Our residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, but in no event exceeding 24 months. Residential construction loans can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the appraised value of the land and 100% of the costs associated with the construction. Residential construction loans are generally made on the same terms as our one- to four-family mortgage loans. At June 30, 2010, the largest residential construction loan commitment was for $17.5 million, with an outstanding balance of $17.3 million and is secured by single family residence with a current appraised value of $50.0 million. This loan was performing according to its terms at June 30, 2010. We also make construction loans for commercial development projects. The projects include multi-family, apartment, retail and office buildings. We generally require that a commitment for permanent financing be in place prior to closing the construction loan. The maximum loan-to-value ratio limit applicable to these loans is generally 80%. At June 30, 2010, commercial construction loans totaled $58.7 million, or 3.8% of total loans. At June 30, 2010, the largest outstanding commercial construction loan commitment was for $14.8 million, with an outstanding balance of $6.4 million and is secured by a shopping mall project, anchored by a well-known grocer. This loan was performing according to its terms at June 30, 2010. 8 Table of Contents Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal on the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We require title insurance and, if applicable, an environmental survey prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan. We generally also review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the terms of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. Construction and development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Additionally, if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. We chose to reduce our exposure to construction lending during fiscal 2009 due to current market and economic conditions. Such loans are now only originated on an exception basis. Construction originations for the year ended June 30, 2010 were $19.1 million, versus $45.1 million for the comparable 2009 period. Other Loans. Other loans totaled $21.7 million, or 1.4% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2010. Other loans primarily consist of business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. Commercial line of credit loans totaled $3.3 million. In 2009, Oritani decided to limit new line of credit lending to well-established customers. Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing of Loans. Lending activities are conducted primarily by our loan personnel operating at our main office. All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both adjustable rate and fixed rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed or adjustable rate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by the current and expected future levels of market interest rates. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, loan originations totaled $417.4 million and purchases totaled $34.4 million, all of which were retained by us. There were no sales of residential mortgage loans in fiscal 2009 or 2010. We will also participate in loans, sometimes as the lead lender. Whether we are the lead lender or not, we underwrite our participation portion of the loan according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. At June 30, 2010, we had $53.3 million in loan participation interests. At June 30, 2010, we were servicing loans sold in the amount of $7.3 million. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. Non-performing and Problem Assets We commence collection efforts when a loan becomes ten days past due with system generated reminder notices. Subsequent late charges and delinquent notices are issued and the account is monitored on a regular basis thereafter. Collections meetings with executive management are regularly held and every delinquent loan is discussed. When a loan is more than 30 days past due, the credit file is reviewed and, if deemed necessary, information is updated or confirmed and collateral re-evaluated. Personal, direct contact with the borrower is attempted early in the collection process. We make every effort to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency. A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. If no repayment plan is in process and the loan is delinquent at least two payments, the file is referred to counsel for the commencement of foreclosure or other collection efforts. 9 Table of Contents Loans are placed on non-accrual status when they are more than 90 days delinquent. When loans are placed on a non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed. Once the outstanding principal balance is brought current, income is recognized to the extent the loan is deemed fully collectible. If the deficiencies causing the delinquency are resolved, such loans may be returned to accrual status once all arrearages are resolved. See additional discussion regarding our non-performing assets at June 30, 2010 in Management Discussion and Analysis. Non-Performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. At each date presented, we had no modifications that have been characterized as troubled debt restructurings.

(2) One construction loan totaling $335,000 was less than 60 days delinquent at June 30, 2008 and was classified as non-accrual. As noted in the above table, there were nonaccrual loans of $38.1 million at June 30, 2010 and $52.5 million at June 30, 2009. Additional interest income of $3.0 million and $3.7 million would have been recorded during the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, if the loans had performed in accordance with their original terms. Interest income on these loans of $595,000 and $787,000 was included in net income for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Item 7.

Such loans had passed their maturity date but continued making monthly payments, keeping their interest current. All such loans have subsequently been extended by us, which negated their past due maturity status. These loans totaled $5.6 million, $3.1 million, and $316,000 at June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 11 Table of Contents Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. The Company had real estate owned of $3.0 million at June 30, 2010. There were no other real estate owned at June 30, 2009 and 2008. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, Oritani Bank obtained title to two properties securing $3.8 million of non-performing loans. The properties were written down to $3.5 million upon acquisition and were subsequently written down further to $3.0 million at June 30, 2010. Both properties are under contract. Closings are expected in September 2010. Classified Assets. FDIC regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We are required to establish general allowances for loan losses for loans classified substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When we classify problem assets as loss, we are required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Since 2005, the Company has engaged an external loan review firm to help ensure that loans are properly classified. The firm performs quarterly reviews. They report to the Audit Committee quarterly and their scope is determined by the Audit Committee annually. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the Department) which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. Such examinations typically occur annually. Our last examination was as of March 31, 2009 by the FDIC. An examination by the Department, as of March 31, 2010, was completed on September 09, 2010. The following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets, including non-performing loans, at the date indicated. Classified Assets At June 30, 2010 June 30, 2009 June 30, 2008 Number Amount Number Amount Number Amount Substandard assets: First mortgage loan balances: Conventional 1 $ 55 2 $ 109 3 $ 85 Multi-family loans   5 7,602   Commercial real estate loans 9 25,219 9 28,827 4 14,375 Construction and land loans 11 31,424 4 19,273   Other loans 2 699     Total 23 $ 57,397 20 $ 55,811 7 $ 14,460 The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets. 12 Table of Contents We also utilize additional classification for assets that do not meet the definition of any of the classified assets yet contain an element that warrants a rating that is less than pass. We classify an asset as special mention if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants managements close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, adversely affecting the repayment of the asset. Our assets classified as special mention totaled $21.6 million, $24.2 million, and $21.7 million at June 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Effective September 30, 2009, we began to also utilize the classification of watch for assets where complete current information has not been procured or a minor weakness is indicated. Our assets classified as watch totaled $32.2 million at June 30, 2010. Impaired Loans. The Company defines an impaired loan as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans we individually classify as impaired include multifamily, commercial mortgage and construction loans. Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loans carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows. If the loans carrying value does exceed the fair value, specific reserves are established to reduce the loans carrying value. For classification purposes, impaired loans are typically classified as substandard. Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans. Allowance for Loan Losses Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for loan losses is set forth in the section Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2010 was maintained at a level that represents managements best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. However, this analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment. In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the FDIC and the Department has authority to periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination. 13 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the fiscal years indicated.

The continued increase in the multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolio is a factor as these types of loans inherently contain more credit risk than one- to four family residential loans. Investments The Board of Directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed periodically by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to appropriate officers. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the Board of Directors, the execution of specific actions primarily rests with Oritani Banks President, Chief Financial Officer and Asset/Liability Committee, which have responsibility for ensuring that the guidelines and requirements included in the investment policy are followed and that all securities are considered prudent for investment. Each of our President, Chief Financial Officer and Asset/Liability Committee have specified authority to purchase various types of investments; all individual investment purchases in excess of $20.0 million and all daily purchases in excess of $30 million must be approved by our Board of Directors. All investment transactions are reviewed and ratified or approved (as the case may be) at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors. Any investment which, subsequent to its purchase, fails to meet the guidelines of the policy is reported to the Board of Directors at its next meeting where the Board decides whether to hold or sell the investment. New Jersey-chartered savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac equity securities. Oritani Financial Corp., as a Delaware Corporation, may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations. The investment policy requires that all securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Investment decisions must be based upon a thorough analysis of each security instrument to determine if its quality and inherent risks fit within Oritani Banks overall asset/liability management objectives, the effect on its risk-based capital measurement and the prospects for yield and/or appreciation. The investment policy provides that Oritani Bank may invest in U.S. treasury notes, U.S. and state agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other conservative investment opportunities. Typical investments are currently in U.S. agency securities and government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 15 Table of Contents Our investment portfolio at June 30, 2010, consisted of $350.0 million in federal agency obligations, a $4.9 million investment in a mutual fund, $2.1 million of corporate debt instruments and $1.8 million in equity securities. We also invest in mortgage-backed securities, all of which are guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises. At June 30, 2010, our mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $144.9 million, or 5.9% of total assets, and consisted of $109.9 million in fixed-rate securities and $37.2 million in adjustable-rate securities, guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Securities can be classified as held to maturity or available for sale at the date of purchase. U.S. Government and Federal Agency Obligations. At June 30, 2010, our U.S. Government and federal agency securities portfolio totaled $350.0 million, all of which was classified as available for sale. Corporate Bonds. At June 30, 2010, our corporate bond portfolio totaled $2.1 million, which consisted of one security, rated BBB-, classified as available for sale. The industry represented by our corporate bond issuer was financial. Although corporate bonds may offer higher yields than U.S. Treasury or agency securities of comparable duration, corporate bonds also have a higher risk of default due to possible adverse changes in the credit-worthiness of the issuer. Mutual Funds. At June 30, 2010, our mutual fund portfolio totaled $4.9 million, or 0.2% of our total assets, all of which were classified as available for sale. The portfolio consisted of an investment in a mutual fund that holds adjustable-rate mortgage loans and similar securities. Equity Securities. At June 30, 2010, our equity securities portfolio totaled $1.8 million, or 0.1% of our total assets, all of which were classified as available for sale. The portfolio consists of financial industry common stock. During fiscal 2010 several of these holdings were deemed other-than-temporarily impaired and the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to earnings of $202,000. Equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and stock market fluctuations. Such investments are carried at their fair value and fluctuations in the fair value of such investments, including temporary declines in value, directly affect out net capital position. Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae. Our investment policy also authorizes the investment in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), also insured or issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae. We limit CMO investments to those classes of CMOs carrying the most stable cash flows and lowest prepayment risk of any class of CMOs and which pass the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Councils average life restriction tests at the time of purchase. These CMO classes are typically referred to as Planned Amortization classes or sequentials. Mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate which is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we focus our investments on mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities (generally U.S. government agencies and government sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as us, and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. 16 Table of Contents At June 30, 2010, our mortgage-backed securities totaled $144.9 million or 5.9%, of total assets and 6.1% of interest earning assets. At June 30, 2010, 25.7% of the mortgage-backed securities were backed by adjustable rate mortgage loans and 75.8% were backed by fixed rate mortgage loans. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 3.09% at June 30, 2010. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities at June 30, 2010 was $147.1 million, which is $5.4 million more than the amortized cost of $141.7 million.

There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. All of the Companys mortgage-backed securities are insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Securities Portfolios.

Deposits have traditionally been the primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, mortgaged-backed securities scheduled payments and prepayments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on other earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. Significant funds were also generated from the recent second step transaction. Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents and businesses within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including checking accounts (demand deposits and NOW), money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts and time deposits. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and other account features are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. Personalized customer service, attractive account features, long-standing relationships with customers, convenient locations, competitive rates of interest and an active marketing program are relied upon to attract and retain deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand while managing interest rate risk and minimizing interest expense. At June 30, 2010, $714.5 million, or 55.40% of our deposit accounts were time deposits, of which $529.4 million had maturities of one year or less.

Our borrowings consist of advances from the FHLB of New York.

The weighted average maturity is estimated because several of our borrowings, under certain circumstances, can be called by the FHLB prior to the scheduled maturity. If this were to occur, our weighted average maturity would decrease. At June 30, 2010 borrowings are secured by mortgage-backed securities and investment securities with a book value of $321.1 million and performing mortgage loans with an outstanding balance of $1.07 billion.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General Federal law allows a state savings bank, such as Oritani Bank, that qualifies as a qualified thrift lender (discussed below), to elect to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended (HOLA). Such an election results in the savings banks holding company being regulated as savings and loan holding company by the OTS rather than as a bank holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. At the time of its reorganization into a holding company structure, Oritani Bank elected to be treated as a savings association under the applicable provisions of the HOLA. Accordingly, Oritani Financial Corp. is a savings and loan holding company and is required to file certain reports with, and is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of, the OTS. Oritani Financial Corp. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. Oritani Bank is a New Jersey-chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Oritani Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner of the Department (the Commissioner) as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as the deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator. Oritani Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess Oritani Banks compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Department, the FDIC, the OTS or the U.S. Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Oritani Financial Corp., Oritani Bank and their operations. Certain of the regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Oritani Bank and Oritani Financial Corp. are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Oritani Bank and Oritani Financial Corp. and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations. New Jersey Banking Regulation Activity Powers. Oritani Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, such as Oritani Bank, generally may invest in: (1) real estate mortgages; (2) consumer and commercial loans; (3) specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; (4) certain types of corporate equity securities; and (5) certain other assets. 24 Table of Contents A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act. Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments. Under this leeway authority, New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required. A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Commissioner. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers are limited by federal law and the related regulations. See -Federal Banking Regulation-Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks below. Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the banks capital funds. A savings bank may lend an additional 10% of its capital funds if the loan is secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. Oritani Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations. Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or alternatively, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Oritani Bank. See -Federal Banking Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action below. Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, such as Oritani Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See -Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements. Examination and Enforcement. The Department may examine Oritani Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The Department examines Oritani Bank at least every two years. The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound banking practice, and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. Federal Banking Regulation Capital Requirements. FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital. The FDIC regulations define two tiers, or classes, of capital. Tier 1 capital is comprised of the sum of:  common stockholders equity, excluding the unrealized appreciation or depreciation, net of tax, from available for sale securities;  non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, including any related retained earnings; and  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries minus all intangible assets, other than qualifying servicing rights and any net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities. 25 Table of Contents The components of Tier 2 capital currently include:  cumulative perpetual preferred stock;  certain perpetual preferred stock for which the dividend rate may be reset periodically;  hybrid capital instruments, including mandatory convertible securities;  term subordinated debt;  intermediate term preferred stock;  allowance for loan losses; and  up to 45% of pretax net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. The allowance for loan losses includible in Tier 2 capital is limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets (as discussed below). Overall, the amount of Tier 2 capital that may be included in total capital cannot exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital. The FDIC regulations establish a minimum leverage capital requirement for banks in the strongest financial and managerial condition of not less than a ratio of 3.0% of Tier 1 capital to total assets. For all other banks, the minimum leverage capital requirement is 4.0%, unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the depository institution. The FDIC regulations also require that banks meet a risk-based capital standard. The risk-based capital standard requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital, which is defined as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4%. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 100%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institutions exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the banks capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a banks capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:  the quality of the banks interest rate risk management process;  the overall financial condition of the bank; and  the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed. The following table shows Oritani Banks Core capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Total risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2010: As of June 30, 2010 Percent of Capital Assets(1) (Dollars in thousands) Core capital 387,439 18.32 % Tier 1 risk-based capital 387,439 23.53 % Total risk-based capital 408,206 24.79 % (1) For purposes of calculating Core capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets. In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets. As the table shows, as of June 30, 2010, Oritani Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines. 26 Table of Contents Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that the federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDICs regulations define the five capital categories as follows: An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:  its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 10%;  its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6%; and  its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level. An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:  its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%; or  its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 4%; and  its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% (3% if the bank receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System) and it is not a well-capitalized institution. An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:  its total risk-based capital is less than 8%; or  its Tier 1 risk-based-capital is less than 4%; and  its leverage ratio is less than 4% (or less than 3% if the institution receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System). An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:  its total risk-based capital is less than 6%;  its Tier 1 capital is less than 3%; or  its leverage ratio is less than 3%. An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed to be critically undercapitalized. The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized. For this purpose, critically undercapitalized means having a ratio of tangible capital to total assets of less than 2%. The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a state bank on the basis of the institutions financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:  insolvency, or when the assets of the bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others;  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices;  existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business;  likelihood that the bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business; and  insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institutions capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance. 27 Table of Contents Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC. Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions. Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the banks total assets or $50 billion. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiarys risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiarys assets with the banks and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. State chartered savings banks may retain subsidiaries in existence as of March 11, 2000 and may engage in activities that are not authorized under federal law. Although Oritani Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not yet determined whether or the extent to which it will seek to engage in such activities. Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Oritani Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts at Oritani Bank are insured by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000. In addition, certain noninterest-bearing transaction accounts maintained with financial institutions participating in the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLG) are fully insured regardless of the dollar amount until December 31, 2010. Oritani Bank has opted to participate in the FDICs TLG Program. The FDIC imposes an assessment against all depository institutions for deposit insurance. This assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and, prior to 2009, ranged from 5 to 43 basis points of the institutions deposits. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC published a final rule raising the current deposit insurance assessment rates to a range from 12 to 45 basis points beginning April 1, 2009. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institutions assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. Our total expense for the special assessment was $846,000 as of June 30, 2009. The FDIC also adopted a rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions were required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The prepayment amount was collected on December 30, 2009. The assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for 2010 was based on each institutions total base assessment rate for the third quarter of 2009, modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009 had been in effect for the entire third quarter, and the assessment rate for 2011 and 2012 was equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional three basis points. In addition, each institutions base assessment rate for each period was calculated using its third quarter assessment base, adjusted quarterly for an estimated 5% annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of 2012. We recorded the pre-payment as a prepaid expense, which will be amortized to expense over three years. On December 30, 2009, the Company paid $8.1 million in estimated assessments, of which $7.1 million is prepaid for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 assessment periods. 28 Table of Contents The deposit insurance assessment rates are in addition to the assessments for payments on the bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, to recapitalize the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO payments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019. Excluding the special assessment noted above, our expense for the assessment of deposit insurance and the FICO payments was $2.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 and $928,000 for the year ended June 30, 2009. The FDIC also established 1.25% of estimated insured deposits as the designated reserve ratio of the DIF. The FDIC is authorized to change the assessment rates as necessary, subject to the previously discussed limitations, to maintain the required reserve ratio of 1.25%. The FDIC also approved a One-Time Assessment Credit to institutions that were in existence on December 31, 1996 and paid deposit insurance assessments prior to that date, or are a successor to such an institution. The Bank received a $2.8 million One-Time Assessment Credit, all of which was used to offset substantially all of our deposit insurance assessment, excluding the FICO payments, for the period from January 1, 2007 through March 31, 2009. The Company is participating in the FDICs Temporary Account Guarantee (TAG) program, which is a part of the FDICs TLG program. The purpose of the TAG is to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. Under the TAG, funds in non-interest-bearing accounts, in interest-bearing transaction accounts with interest rate of 0.25% or less and in Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts will have a temporary unlimited guarantee from the FDIC until December 31, 2010. The coverage of the TAG is in addition to and separate from coverage available under the FDICs general deposit insurance rules, which insure accounts up to $250,000. Federal Home Loan Bank System. Oritani Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of New York, Oritani Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank in an amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, 4.5% of its borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, or 0.3% of assets, whichever is greater. As of June 30, 2010 Oritani Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including Oritani Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and to unsafe or unsound practices. Transactions with Affiliates of Oritani Bank. Transactions between an insured bank, such as Oritani Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of an insured bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:  limits the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such banks capital stock and retained earnings, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and retained earnings; and  requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 29 Table of Contents The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. Privacy Standards. FDIC regulations require Oritani Bank to disclose their privacy policy, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. Oritani Bank does not share non-public personal information with third parties. In addition, Oritani Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having Oritani Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions. The FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institutions record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations replace the prior process-based assessment factors with a new evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:  a lending test, to evaluate the institutions record of making loans in its service areas;  an investment test, to evaluate the institutions record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and  a service test, to evaluate the institutions delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. An institutions failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Oritani Bank received a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in our most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC in 2005. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 30 Table of Contents Loans to a Banks Insiders Federal Regulation. A banks loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such persons (an insiders related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insiders related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to Oritani Bank. See -New Jersey Banking Regulation-Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate generally may not exceed the banks unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officers children and certain loans secured by the officers primary residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) $100,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the banks unimpaired capital and surplus. Federal regulation also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insiders related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the banks unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a banks insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. New Jersey Regulation. Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act. Other Regulations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Oritani Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Oritani Banks operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:  Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;  Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;  Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;  Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and  rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 31 Table of Contents The operations of Oritani Bank also are subject to the:  Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;  Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;  Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;  Title III of The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (referred to as the USA PATRIOT Act), which significantly expanded the responsibilities of financial institutions, including savings banks, in preventing the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. Among other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act and the related regulations of the OTS require savings associations operating in the United States to develop new anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations; and  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which placed limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institutions privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. The Dodd-Frank Act Congress recently enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). This new law will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a near term effect on us. For example, the new law provides that the Office of Thrift Supervision, which is the current primary federal regulator for Oritani Financial Corp., will cease to exist one year from the date of the new laws enactment. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies that were formerly regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, including Oritani Financial Corp. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is currently the primary federal regulator for national banks, will become the primary federal regulator for federal thrifts. 32 Table of Contents Also effective one year after the date of enactment is a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse effect on our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2013. The Dodd-Frank Act will require publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments, and by authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a companys proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense. Holding Company Regulation General. Oritani Financial Corp. is non-diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the HOLA. As such, Oritani Financial Corp. is registered with the OTS and subject to OTS regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the OTS has enforcement authority over Oritani Financial Corp and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the OTS to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. As a Delaware Corporation, Oritani Financial Corp. is generally subject to state business organization laws. Oritani Financial Corp. is subject to the requirements of Delaware law that generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the difference between the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities and the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the outstanding shares of capital stock. If there is no difference between these amounts, dividends are limited to net income for the current and/or preceding year. The rights of the stockholders of Oritani Financial Corp. are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law. Permitted Activities. Pursuant to Section 10(o) of the HOLA and OTS regulations and policy, a savings and loan holding company such as Oritani Financial Corp. may engage in the following activities: (i) investing in the stock of a savings bank; (ii) acquiring a mutual association through the merger of such association into a savings bank subsidiary of such holding company or an interim savings bank subsidiary of such holding company; 33 Table of Contents (iii) merging with or acquiring another holding company, one of whose subsidiaries is a savings bank; (iv) investing in a corporation, the capital stock of which is available for purchase by a savings bank under federal law or under the law of any state where the subsidiary savings bank or associations share their home offices; (v) furnishing or performing management services for a savings bank subsidiary of such company; (vi) holding, managing or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a savings subsidiary of such company; (vii) holding or managing properties used or occupied by a savings bank subsidiary of such company; (viii) acting as trustee under deeds of trust; (ix) any other activity: A. that the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, unless the Director, by regulation, prohibits or limits any such activity for savings and loan holding companies; or B. in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized (by regulation) to directly engage on March 5, 1987; (x) any activity permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act, including securities and insurance underwriting; and (xi) purchasing, holding, or disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the purchase of such stock by such savings and loan holding company is approved by the Director. The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Oritani Financial Corp., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the OTS. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the HOLA, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the OTS must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. The OTS is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 34 Table of Contents Qualified Thrift Lender Test. In order for Oritani Financial Corp. to continue to be regulated as savings and loan holding company by the OTS (rather than as a bank holding companies by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), Oritani Bank must qualify as a qualified thrift lender under OTS regulations or satisfy the domestic building and loan association test under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the qualified thrift lender test, a savings institution is required to maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangible, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine out of each 12 month period. Oritani Bank currently maintains the majority of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and has met the qualified thrift lender test in each of the last 12 months. Federal Securities Laws Oritani Financial Corp.s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Oritani Financial Corp. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Oritani Financial Corp. common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of Oritani Financial Corp. may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If Oritani Financial Corp. meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of Oritani Financial Corp. is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each will be required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal controls; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls. Oritani Financial Corp is required to report under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and has reported that it complies with such in all material respects. FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION Federal Taxation General. Oritani Financial Corp. and Oritani Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Neither Oritani Financial Corp.s nor Oritani Banks federal tax returns are currently under audit, and neither entity has been audited during the past five years. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Oritani Financial Corp. or Oritani Bank. Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Oritani Financial Corp. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, Oritani Bank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996, pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), that eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1988. Oritani Bank recaptured its reserve balance over the six-year period ended December 31, 2003. 35 Table of Contents Currently, the Oritani Bank consolidated group uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should Oritani Bank fail to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. At June 30, 2010, our total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $15.1 million. However, under current law, pre-base year reserves remain subject to recapture should Oritani Bank make certain non-dividend distributions, repurchase any of its stock, pay dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or cease to maintain a bank charter. Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Oritani Financial Corp. and Oritani Bank have not been subject to the AMT and have no such amounts available as credits for carryover. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards. A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At June 30, 2010, Oritani Bank had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation. Oritani Bank files New Jersey Corporation Business income tax returns. Generally, the income of savings institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax. Oritani Bank is not currently under audit with respect to its New Jersey income tax returns and Oritani Banks state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years. New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership. However, under recent tax legislation, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the New Jersey Director of the Division of Taxation may, at the directors discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return for the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income. Delaware State Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and a franchise tax to the state of Delaware. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Future Changes in Interest Rates Could Reduce Our Profits. Our ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between:  the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and  the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. 36 Table of Contents In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Changes in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At June 30, 2010 the fair value of our available for sale agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt obligations totaled $430.5 million. Unrealized net gains on these available for sale securities totaled approximately $5.8 million at June 30, 2010 and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders equity. In addition, many of our FHLB of New York advances are callable, often five years from the date of issuance. To the extent the FHLB of New York calls all or a portion of these advances, we would need to find another funding source, which might be more expensive to us than these advances. We evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in Oritani Banks net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios. Net portfolio value is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. At June 30, 2010, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the model projects that we would experience a $62.0 million, or 9.1%, decrease in net portfolio value. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk. Our Continued Emphasis On Multi-Family, and Commercial Real Estate Lending Could Expose Us To Increased Lending Risks. Our business strategy centers on continuing our emphasis on multi-family, and commercial real estate lending. We have grown our loan portfolio in recent years with respect to these types of loans and intend to continue to emphasize these types of lending. At June 30, 2010, $1.12 billion, or 73.0%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of multi-family loans and commercial real estate loans. As a result, our credit risk profile will be higher than traditional thrift institutions that have higher concentrations of one- to four-family residential loans. Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. This risk increases during a negative economic cycle. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified on the basis of the propertys collateral value, net income and debt service ratio; however, there is no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit-related losses. Finally, if we foreclose on multi-family and commercial real estate loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than one-to four- family residential mortgage loans because there a fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. We had two separate $21.0 million commercial real estate loans in our portfolio at June 30, 2010. These loans were the largest loans in the portfolio at that date. Both are secured by shopping malls, one located in Ocean County, New Jersey and the other located in Putnam County, New York. Our largest loan relationship consisted of multifamily properties located mainly in our primary market area with a real estate investor. The aggregate outstanding loan balance for this relationship is $45.0 million at June 30, 2010. As discussed in Business of Oritani Financial Corp-Lending Activities, we have recently been utilizing stricter underwriting for these types of loans, and curtailed our construction lending. 37 Table of Contents If Our Allowance for Loan Losses is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Will Decrease. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Our delinquent and non-performing loans as well as classified assets have risen over the past 36 months, and this growth increases the possibility that our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient in the future. In addition, the majority of our loan growth since June 30, 2006, has been in commercial real estate loans. According to Real Estate Econometrics, a property research firm, default rates on commercial loans climbed to a 16 year high during the quarter ended September 30, 2009. Real Estate Econometrics projects that the default rate will peak in 2011, before falling back. While our allowance for loan losses was 1.69% of total loans at June 30, 2010, material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Current Market and Economics Conditions May Significantly Affect Our Operations and Financial Condition. Uncertainty in the financial markets and downturn in general economic conditions, including increased levels of unemployment, has persisted over the past few years. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry. In general, loan and investment securities credit quality has deteriorated at many institutions and the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline. Indications of the deterioration of the value of real estate collateral have been evidenced on a national level as well as in our Market Area. These developments could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. Housing market conditions in the New York metropolitan area, where most of our lending activity occurs, deteriorated over the past several years. The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, the leading measure of U.S. home prices, showed that the price of existing single family homes in the New York metro area as June, 2010, had a slight increase of 0.2% versus the June 2009 prices. Though housing prices have had a slight rebound, the effects of the expired tax incentives and continuing foreclosures could reverse the trend. RealtyTrac, a leading online marketplace for foreclosure properties, reported that national foreclosure filings decreased 5% for the six months ended June 30, 2010, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2009. New Jersey was the 10th highest state in number of foreclosure filings over the six months ended June 30, 2010, though its foreclosure rate was not in the top ten. The rate of foreclosures in Bergen County was much lower than the average for New Jersey. Though total non-performing assets decreased to $41.2 million at June 30, 2010 from $52.5 million at June 30, 2009, and total non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 1.66% at June 30, 2010 as compared to 2.74% at June 30, 2009, classified assets increased from $55.8 million at June 30, 2009 to $57.4 million at June 30, 2010. If loans that are currently non-performing further deteriorate or loans that are currently performing become non-performing loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company would have recognized an additional $3.0 million in interest income during the year ended June 30, 2010 had non-performing loans performed in accordance with the original terms. 38 Table of Contents Our Deposit Growth Has Been A Primary Funding Source. If Deposit Growth Slows, It May Be More Expensive For Us To Fund Loan Originations. We experienced a period of unprecedented deposit growth, with a 61.3% increase in deposit balances from June 30, 2008 to June 30, 2009, and strong growth from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010. Management believes a portion of this growth was due to external factors, as funds were withdrawn from the stock market and deposited into investment options considered safe by the investors, such as Oritani Bank. Such depositors may choose to redeploy these funds in the stock market at a future date, regardless of our efforts. If this occurs, it would hamper our ability to grow deposits and could even result in a net outflow of deposits. In addition, the increase in deposit insurance limits also may have contributed to our deposit growth and we could experience a net outflow of deposits of such deposit insurance limits were reduced. We will continue to focus on deposit growth, which we use to fund loan originations and purchase investment securities. However, if we are unable to continue to sufficiently increase our deposit balances, we may be required to utilize alternative sources of funding, including Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, or increase our deposit rates, each of which will increase our cost of funds. Higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance premiums have increased our expenses and any future insurance premium increases will adversely affect our earnings. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule levying a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institutions assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. We recorded an expense of $846,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, to reflect the special assessment. Any further special assessments that the FDIC levies will be recorded as an expense during the appropriate period. In addition, the FDIC materially increased the general assessment rate and, therefore, our FDIC general insurance premium expense will increase substantially compared to prior periods. The FDIC also adopted a rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions were required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The prepayment amount was collected on December 30, 2009. The assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for 2010 was based on each institutions total base assessment rate for the third quarter of 2009, modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009 had been in effect for the entire third quarter, and the assessment rate for 2011 and 2012 was equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional three basis points. In addition, each institutions base assessment rate for each period was calculated using its third quarter assessment base, adjusted quarterly for an estimated 5% annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of 2012. We recorded the pre-payment as a prepaid expense, which will be amortized to expense over three years. On December 30, 2009, the Company paid $8.1 million in estimated assessments, of which $7.1 million is prepaid for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 assessment periods. If Our Investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York is Classified as Other-Than-Temporarily Impaired or as Permanently Impaired, Our Earnings Could Decrease. We own common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLB-NY). We hold the FHLB-NY common stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB-NYs advance program. The aggregate cost and fair value of our FHLB-NY common stock as of June 30, 2010 was $25.1 million based on its par value. There is no market for our FHLB-NY common stock. Certain member banks of the Federal Home Loan Bank System may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels. In an extreme situation, it is possible that the capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank, including the FHLB-NY, could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, we believe that there is a risk that our investment in FHLB-NY common stock could be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at some time in the future, and if this occurs, it would cause our earnings to decrease by the after-tax amount of the impairment charge. Our Inability to Achieve Profitability on New Branches May Negatively Affect Our Earnings. We have expanded our presence throughout our market area and we intend to pursue further expansion through de novo branching. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income. 39 Table of Contents Strong Competition Within Our Market Area May Limit Our Growth and Profitability. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For additional information see Business of Oritani Financial Corp  Competition. We Operate in a Highly Regulated Industry, Which Limits the Manner and Scope of Our Business Activities. We are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking, FDIC and OTS. As a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the DIF and our depositors, and not to benefit our stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, stock repurchases, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. Government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws. New financial reform legislation has been enacted by Congress that will change the bank regulatory framework, create an independent consumer protection bureau that will assume the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and establish more stringent capital standards for financial institutions and their holding companies. The legislation will also result in new regulations affecting the lending, funding, trading and investment activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. Such additional regulation and oversight could have a material and adverse impact on us. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
