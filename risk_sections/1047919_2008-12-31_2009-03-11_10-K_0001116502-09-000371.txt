Item 1a. Risk Factors OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE PRINCIPAL RISKS NOTED BELOW. 8 RISKS CONCERNING OUR BUSINESS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DUKE ENERGY IS MATERIAL TO OUR SUCCESS, AND THE TERMINATION OF SUCH RELATIONSHIP FOR ANY REASON MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS. Our immediate business opportunities continue to be largely dependent on the success of our deployments with Duke Energy. We are focusing much of our time, attention and resources on the rollout of the equipment and software delivered to this utility. The success of our endeavors with respect to the deployment is subject to several risks. We depend on third parties to deliver and support reliable components to manufacture and assemble our end products, as well as our engineering team to continue to advance our software products. If we are unable to effectively manage and maintain our relationship with the utility, our business could be materially and adversely affected in its ability to continue, and our operations could be jeopardized. We will likely need to secure additional contracts with this and other utilities to be able to continue our operations in the future, and there is no assurance that other utilities will adopt our smart grid technology or contract with us to provide our services to them. ADVERSE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS AND, IN TURN, OUR OPERATING RESULTS Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. The strength of the global economy has been increasingly uncertain, including difficulties in the real estate and mortgage, volatility in the fuel and other energy costs and problems in the financial services and credit markets. Such macroeconomics factors could affect the budgeting and purchasing behavior of our customers. If economic growth is slowed or uncertain customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, slower adoption of new technologies and increase price competition. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial conditions. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND EXISTING COMMERCAIL DEPLOYMENTS. Management believes that our currently available cash resources, as well as anticipated revenues will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise funds in order to expand existing commercial deployments and otherwise grow our operations to meet the demands associated with any additional significant purchase orders. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining additional required capital if or when needed. TO DATE, WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE, AND THE LOSS OF, OR A SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALL IN ORDERS FROM, KEY CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE. We have derived a substantial portion of our total revenue from a limited number of customers as a result of the nature of our strategy and target market. During any given fiscal quarter, a small number of customers may account for a significant percentage of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, 100% and 99% of our total revenue was accounted for by Duke Energy. Our inability to generate anticipated revenue from our key existing or targeted customers, or a significant shortfall in sales to any of them may significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to effect deployments with new utilities and to continue our deployments with our existing utilities. A DEFAULT BY US UNDER OUR SECURED CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES ISSUED IN 2007 AND 2008 WOULD ENABLE THE NOTE HOLDER TO FORECLOSE ON OUR ASSETS. Between July 31, 2007 and January 15, 2008, we issued $12,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of our Secured Convertible Promissory Notes to Vicis Capital Master Fund (Vicis). The notes are scheduled to mature between July 2010 and January 2011. These notes are secured by a lien on our assets. Vicis currently holds approximately 65% of our issued and outstanding common stock. A default by us under these notes would enable Vicis to foreclose on our assets. Any foreclosure could force us to substantially curtail or cease our operations. 9 OTHERS MAY CHALLENGE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. We have filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), and with the appropriate agencies in foreign countries and other jurisdictions, patent applications with respect to the BPL and Energy Sensing portion of Ambient Smart Grid™ on the medium and low voltage distribution grid. Our portfolio includes twenty-one patents issued or allowed by the USPTO primarily relating to coupling technology, and we have several pending patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions. While we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that our rights relating to Ambients Smart Grid™ solution may be challenged and invalidated or circumvented. Further, effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer, or otherwise use aspects of processes and devices that we may regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary information is difficult, and there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technologies. In the event that our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the market for technolog ies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. OTHER COMPANIES MAY DEVELOP AND SELL COMPETING PRODUCTS WHICH MAY REDUCE THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR RENDER OUR PRODUCTS OBSOLETE. The smart grid communications marketplace is rapidly evolving and therefore has rapidly changing technological, regulatory and consumer requirements. We will need to continue to maintain and improve our competitive position to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers, and continue to develop and introduce new products, features and services in a timely and efficient manner. Our competitors include both small companies as well as some of the largest companies in the electronics industry, operating either alone or together with trade associations and partners. There can be no assurance that other companies will not develop products that compete with our products in the future. Some of our potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than our Company. These potential competitors may, among other things, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, obtain more favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers and exert more influence on the sales channel than we do. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with these potential competitors, and these potential competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more widely accepted than those we are developing or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES, AND WE EXPECT THESE LOSSES TO CONTINUE INTO 2009. We are a company engaged in the design, development and marketing of our smart grid communication technology and solutions. We incurred net losses of $11,294,199 and $15,756,393 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect to continue to incur net losses as we further develop, test, and market Ambient Smart Grid™ technology. Our ability to generate and sustain significant additional revenues or achieve profitability will depend upon the factors discussed elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section. There are no assurances that we will achieve or sustain profitability, or that our operating losses will not increase in the future. If we do achieve profitability, we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT EFFECTIVE, THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY BE QUESTIONED AND OUR SHARE PRICE MAY SUFFER. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting, and our 10 management is required to issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the effectiveness of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. Our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2009. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. It is possible that we could discover certain deficiencies in the design and/or operation of our internal controls that could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. We have invested and will continue to invest significant resources in this process. We are uncertain as to what impact a conclusion that deficiencies exist in our internal control over financial reporting would have on the trading price of our common stock. RISKS CONCERNING OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE VICIS CAPITAL MASTER FUND OWNS A MAJORITY OF AMBIENTS ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND WILL THUS BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF ALL ISSUES SUBMITTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. Contemporaneous with the $8 million investment in our Company in November 2008, Vicis exercised all then outstanding warrants it then held and, as of March 10, 2009, Vicis holds approximately 65% of our issued and outstanding common stock. In addition, if the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes held by Vicis were immediately converted by it into common stock of the Company, it could result in the issuance of an additional 833,333,333 shares of our common stock to Vicis. If Vicis exercises the remaining warrants and is issued the shares from the outstanding principal of the notes it holds, Vicis will then hold a total of 1,299,081,747 shares of our common stock or approximately 84% of the 1,553,697,451 shares of common stock that would be issued and outstanding following such exercises. As a result, Vicis is able to control the outcome of substantially all issues submitted to our stockholders, including the election of all of our directors. A principal of Vicis also is a member of our board of directors. FUTURE SALES OF COMMON STOCK OR OTHER DILUTIVE EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. As of December 31, 2008, we were authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 718,980,784 shares were outstanding. As of December 31, 2008, an additional 1,026,724,097 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding debt securities and the exercise of outstanding options and warrants to purchase common stock and the reservations of shares in the Plans. Many of the above options, warrants and convertible securities contain provisions that require the issuance of increased numbers of shares of common stock upon exercise or conversion in the event of stock splits, redemptions, mergers and other transactions. The occurrence of any such event or the exercise or conversion of any of these options, warrants or convertible securities would dilute the interest in our company represented by each share of common stock and may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. Additionally, our board of directors has the authority, without further action or vote of our stockholders, to issue authorized shares of our common stock that are not reserved for issuance. In addition, in order to raise the amount of capital that we need at the current market price of our common stock, we may need to issue a significant number of shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exercisable for a significant number of shares of our common stock. Any of these issuances will dilute the percentage ownership interests of our current stockholders, which will have the effect of reducing their influence on matters on which our stockholders vote, and might dilute the book value and market value of our common stock. Our stockholders may incur additional dilution upon the exercise of currently outstanding or subsequently granted options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE. The market price of our common stock will likely fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: · Announcements by us of commencement of, changes to, or cancellation of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 11 · Changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results by securities analysts or investors; · Variations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including but not limited to those identified in this "RISK FACTORS " section; · Additions or departures of key personnel; · Future sales of our common stock; · Stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our stock; · Commencement of or involvement in litigation; and/or · Announcements by us, or by our competitors of technological innovations or new products. In addition, the equity markets have experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities issued by high technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS ARE APPLICABLE TO INVESTMENT IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks" are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, provided that current prices and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities are provided by the exchange or system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny st ock held in the customer's account. In addition, penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to penny stock rules. Many brokers will not deal with penny stocks, restricting the market for our shares of common stock. BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A RETURN ON THEIR SHARES UNLESS THEY SELL THEM. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. Item 1b. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
