Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report, in evaluating our Company, its business, and prospects. The following risks could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to be materially and adversely affected. Because we may never earn revenues from our operations, our business may fail and then investors may lose all of their investment in our Company. We have no recent history of revenues from operations. We have never had significant operations and have no significant assets. We have yet to generate positive earnings and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. We have a limited operating history and are in the exploration stage. The success of our Company is significantly dependent on the uncertain events of the discovery and exploitation of mineral reserves on our properties or selling the rights to exploit those mineral reserves. If our business plan is not successful and we are not able to operate profitably, then our stock may become worthless and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company. Prior to completion of the exploration stage, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from the exploration of our mineral claims in the future, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide no assurance that we will generate any revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will fail and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company. Transportation difficulties and weather interruptions may affect and delay proposed mining operations and impact our proposed business. Our mining properties are accessible by road. The climate in the area is hot and dry in the summer but cold and subject to snow in the winter, which could at times hamper accessibility depending on the winter season precipitation levels. As a result, our exploration and mining plans could be delayed for several months each year. Such delays could affect our anticipated business operations and increase our expenses. 9 Supplies and equipment needed for exploration may not always be available. If we are unable to secure exploration supplies we may have to delay our anticipated business operations. Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies needed for our proposed exploration work could result in occasional shortages of supplies of certain products, equipment or materials. There is no guarantee we will be able to obtain certain products, equipment and/or materials as and when needed, without interruption, or on favorable terms. Such delays could affect our anticipated business operations and increase our expenses. We have invested capital in high-risk mineral projects where we have not conducted sufficient exploration and engineering studies. We have invested capital and have otherwise been involved in various mineral properties and projects in the Comstock District where we may not have conducted sufficient exploration and engineering studies to minimize the risk of project failure to the extent that is typical in the mining industry or prudent considering our size. Our mineral projects involve high risks because we have not invested sufficient sums in the characterization of mineralized material, geologic analysis, metallurgical testing, mine planning and economic analysis to the same extent that other mining companies might deem reasonable due to limited resources. Standard industry practice calls for a mining company to prepare a formal mine plan and mining schedule and have these documents reviewed by a third party specialist. We do not have a formal mine plan that has been reviewed by a third party specialist. Because we have not established proven or probable reserves, there can be no assurance that we will be able to produce sufficient quantities of gold or other mineralized material to recover our investment and operating costs. We will not be successful unless we recover precious metals and sell them for a profit. Our success depends on our ability to recover precious metals, process them, and successfully sell them for more than the cost of production. The success of this process depends on the market prices of metals in relation to our costs of production. We may not always be able to generate a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals because we can only maintain a level of control over our costs and have no ability to control the market prices. The total cash costs of production at any location are frequently subject to great variation from year to year as a result of a number of factors, such as the changing composition of ore grade or mineralized material production, and metallurgy and exploration activities in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body or deposit. In addition costs are affected by the price of commodities, such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in production costs or a decrease in the price of gold or other minerals could adversely affect our ability to earn a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals. We do not have proven or probable reserves, and there is no assurance that the quantities of precious metals we produce will be sufficient to recover our investment and operating costs. Our success depends on our ability to produce sufficient quantities of precious metals to recover our investment and operating costs. We do not have proven or probable reserves. There can be no assurance that our exploration activities will result in the discovery of sufficient quantities of mineralized material to lead to a commercially successful operation. 10 The cost of our exploration and acquisition activities is substantial, and there is no assurance that the quantities of minerals we discover or acquire will justify commercial operations or replace reserves established in the future. Mineral exploration, particularly for gold and other precious metals, is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks, and frequently is nonproductive. There can be no assurance that our exploration and acquisition activities will be commercially successful. If gold mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties, to establish ore reserves through drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore, and in the case of new properties, to develop the processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mineral exploration. There can be no assurance that any gold reserves or mineralized material that may be discovered or acquired in the future, if any, will be in sufficient quantities or of adequate grade to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for mineral production operation can be obtained on a timely or reasonable basis. Mineral exploration companies must continually replace mineralized material or reserves depleted by production. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in replacing any reserves or mineralized material acquired or established in the future. The price of gold and silver fluctuate on a regular basis and a downturn in price could negatively impact our operations and cash flow. Our operations are significantly affected by changes in the market price of gold and silver. Gold and silver prices can fluctuate widely and may be affected by numerous factors, such as expectations for inflation, levels of interest rates, currency exchange rates, central bank sales, forward selling or other hedging activities, demand for precious metals, global or regional political and economic crises and production costs in major gold-producing regions, such as but not limited to South Africa and the former Soviet Union. The aggregate effect of these factors, all of which are beyond our control, is impossible for us to predict. The demand for, and supply of, gold and silver affect prices, but not necessarily in the same manner as supply and demand affect the prices of other commodities. The supply of gold and silver consists of a combination of new mineral production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments, public and private financial institutions, industrial organizations, and private individuals. As the amount produced in any single year constitutes a small portion of the total potential supply of gold and silver, normal variations in current production do not have a significant impact on the supply of gold or on its price. If gold or silver prices decline substantially, it could adversely affect the realizable value of our assets and potential future results of operations and cash flow. The use of hedging instruments may not prevent losses being realized on subsequent price decreases or may prevent gains being realized from subsequent price increases. We may from time to time sell some future production of gold pursuant to hedge positions. If the gold price rises above the price at which future production has been committed under these hedge instruments, we will have an opportunity loss. However, if the gold price falls below that committed price, our revenues will be protected to the extent of such committed production. In addition, we may experience losses if a hedge counterparty defaults under a contract when the contract price exceeds the gold price. As of December 31, 2010, we have no open hedge positions. Since our business consists of exploring for or acquiring gold and silver prospects, the drop in the price of gold or silver will negatively affect our asset values, cash flows, potential revenues and profits. We plan to pursue opportunities to acquire properties with gold or silver mineralized material or reserves with exploration potential. The price that we pay to acquire these properties will be influenced, in large part, by the price of gold and silver at the time of the acquisition. Our potential future revenues are expected to be derived from the production and sale of gold and silver from these properties or from the sale of some of these properties. The value of any gold reserves and other mineralized material, and the value of any potential mineral production therefrom, will vary in direct proportion to variations in those mineral prices. The price of gold and silver has fluctuated widely as a result of numerous factors beyond our control. The effect of these factors on the price of gold and silver, and therefore the economic viability of any of our projects, cannot accurately be predicted. Any drop in the price of gold or silver would negatively affect our asset values, cash flows, potential revenues, and profits. 11 We compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies which could lead to the loss of opportunities for our business. We compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies or individuals, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities and financial resources, to acquire rights to mineral properties containing gold and other minerals. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim staking, lease or other acquisition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire mineral properties against competitors with substantially greater financial resources than we have. Our activities are inherently hazardous and any exposure may exceed our insurance limits or may not be insurable. Mineral exploration and operating activities are inherently hazardous. Operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration and production of gold and other metals, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, and possible environmental damage. The nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any liability insurance policy limits. It is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable, or we could elect not to insure ourselves against such liabilities because of the high premium costs, in which event, we could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We do not have proven or probable reserves, and our mineral calculations are only estimates; any material change may negatively affect the economic viability of our properties. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties with established reserves or to establish proven or probable reserves through drilling and analysis. We do anticipate expending sums for additional drilling and analysis which may or may not establish proven or probable reserves on our properties. We drill in connection with our mineral exploration activities and not with the purpose of establishing proven and probable reserves. Therefore, our activity must be called exploration or test mining. While we estimate the amount of mineralized material we believe exists on our properties, our calculations are estimates only, subject to uncertainty due to factors, including the quantity and grade of ore, metal prices, and recoverability of minerals in the mineral recovery process. There is a great degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of any mineralized material, particularly where there has not been significant drilling, mining, and processing. Until the mineralized material located on our properties is actually mined and processed, the quantity and quality of the mineralized material must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of mineralized material may vary depending on metal prices. Any material change in the quantity of mineralized material may negatively affect the economic viability of our properties. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will achieve the same recoveries of metals contained in the mineralized material as in small-scale laboratory tests or that we will be able to duplicate such results in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. Our operations are subject to strict environmental regulations, which result in added costs of operations and operational delays. Our operations are subject to environmental regulations, which could result in additional costs and operational delays. All phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation. Environmental legislation is evolving in the United States generally, and Nevada specifically, in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors, and employees. There is no assurance that any future changes in environmental regulation will not negatively affect our projects. 12 We have no insurance for environmental problems. Insurance against environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, has not been available generally in the mining industry. We have no insurance coverage for most environmental risks. In the event of a problem, the payment of environmental liabilities and costs would reduce the funds available to us for future operations. If we are unable to fund fully the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to enter into an interim compliance measure pending completion of the required remedy. We are subject to federal laws that require environmental assessments and the posting of bonds, which add significant costs to our operations and delays in our projects. The BLM requires that mining operations on lands subject to its regulation obtain an approved plan of operations subject to environmental impact evaluation under the National Environmental Policy Act. Any significant modifications to the plan of operations may require the completion of an environmental assessment or Environmental Impact Statement prior to approval. Mining companies must post a bond or other surety to guarantee the cost of post-mining reclamation. These requirements could add significant additional cost and delays to any mining project undertaken by us. Our mineral exploration operations are required to be covered by reclamation bonds deemed adequate by regulators to cover these risks. We believe we currently maintain adequate reclamation bonds for our operations. Changes in Nevada laws, which are already strict and costly, can negatively affect our operations by becoming stricter and more costly. At the state level, mining operations in Nevada are regulated by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, or NDEP. Nevada state law requires our Nevada projects to hold Nevada Water Pollution Control Permits, which dictate operating controls and closure and post-closure requirements directed at protecting surface and ground water. In addition, we are required to hold Nevada Reclamation Permits required under Nevada law. These permits mandate concurrent and post-mining reclamation of mines and require the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation. Other Nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations. Any changes to these laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our financial performance and results of operations by, for example, requiring changes to operating constraints, technical criteria, fees or surety requirements. Title claims against our properties could require us to compensate parties, if successful, and divert management’s time from operations. There may be challenges to our title in the properties in which we hold material interests. If there are title defects with respect to any of our properties, we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property. The validity of unpatented mineral claims, which constitute most of our holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested by the federal government and other parties. The validity of an unpatented mineral claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, depends on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our properties, we have not obtained title opinions or title insurance with respect to the acquisition of the unpatented mineral claims. While we have no pending claims or litigation pending contesting title to any of our properties, there is nothing to prevent parties from challenging our title to any of our properties. While we believe we have satisfactory title to our properties, some risk exists that some titles may be defective or subject to challenge. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management’s time from ongoing exploration programs. Our business depends on a limited number of key personnel, the loss of whom could negatively affect us. Each of our officers and employees is important to our success. If any of them becomes unable or unwilling to continue in their respective positions and we are unable to find suitable replacements, our business and financial results could be materially negatively affected. 13 If we fail to adequately manage our growth, we may not be successful in growing our business and becoming profitable. We plan to expand our business and the number of employees over the next 12 months. In particular, we intend to hire additional operational personnel. Our inability to hire and retain additional qualified employees could have a negative impact on our chances of success. The issuance of securities by us may not have complied with or violated federal and state securities laws and, as a result, the holders of these shares and warrants may have rescission rights. Securities issued by us may not have complied with applicable federal and state securities laws, the result of which is that the holders of these securities may have rescission rights that could require us to reacquire the securities. Our stock is a penny stock and trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC’s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock. Our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9, which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors.” The term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockbroker’s ability to buy or sell our stock. In addition to the “penny stock” rules promulgated by the SEC, the FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretation of these rules, the NASD believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy or sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. 14 Our security holders may face significant restrictions on the resale of our securities due to state “blue sky” laws. Each state has its own securities laws, often called “blue sky” laws, which (i) limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (ii) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or the transaction must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker must be registered in that state. We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as the market-makers for our common stock. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification. Restrictions imposed by the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Preferred Shares”) may inhibit growth. The Certificates of Designations of the Preferred Shares substantially limit the ability of the Company to incur debt or redeem capital stock, among other things. Such restrictions could significantly impact the Company’s ability to raise capital, fund production, or generate cash flows. Holders of common stock will be minority stockholders of the Company. Through its ownership of Preferred Shares, the Winfield Group owns approximately 38.0% of the economic interests of the Company’s capital stock and approximately 75.8% of the voting security interests, in each case on an as converted basis. As a result, the ability of holders of common stock to determine the management and policies of the Company will be significantly limited. Outstanding convertible securities and warrants may result in substantial dilution. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding 21,154,663 shares of common stock. In addition, we had outstanding Preferred Shares plus various common stock purchase warrants. At December 31, 2010, Preferred Shares and warrants were convertible into, or exercisable for, a total of approximately 71.2 million additional shares of our common stock, subject to further anti-dilution provisions. The terms of the Operating Agreement of Northern Comstock may significantly dilute the ownership interests of the common stock. The Operating Agreement of Northern Comstock provides for capital contributions by the Company of shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A-1 Preferred Stock”) unless Northern Comstock requests payment in cash. The Operating Agreement provides for additional capital contributions of 862.5 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock (approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock as converted) on each anniversary of the Operating Agreement through and including the 39th anniversary, if no requests for contributions in cash were made. If an event of default occurs under the Operating Agreement, the additional capital contributions could be accelerated and the entire unpaid amount of the Company’s capital contribution, up to the aggregate 34,500 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock (approximately 53 million shares of common stock as converted) issuable under the Operating Agreement, could become issuable immediately at the option of Northern Comstock. The Company may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future that could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. The Company is currently authorized to issue 3,950,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 21,154,663 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2010, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 65,906.1 Preferred Shares are issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2010. To maintain its capital at desired levels or to fund future growth, the Board may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. The sale of these securities may significantly dilute stockholders’ ownership interest and depress the market price of the common stock. New investors in other equity securities issued by the Company in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to the Company’s current stockholders that may adversely impact its current stockholders. 15
