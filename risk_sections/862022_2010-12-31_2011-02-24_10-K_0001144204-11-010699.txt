Item 1A, Risk Factors. 24 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The only assets of and sources of income to the trust are the net profits interests, which generally entitle the trust to receive a share of the net profits from oil and gas production from the underlying properties. Consequently, the trust is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in oil and gas prices. The trust is a passive entity and, other than the trust’s ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses, liabilities and obligations of the trust that cannot be paid out of cash held by the trust, the trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions. The amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the trust. In addition, the trustee is prohibited by the trust indenture from engaging in any business activity or causing the trust to enter into any investments other than investing cash on hand in specific short-term cash investments. Therefore, the trust cannot hold any derivative financial instruments. As a result of the limited nature of its borrowing and investing activities, the trust is not subject to any material interest rate market risk. Additionally, any gains or losses from any hedging activities conducted by XTO Energy are specifically excluded from the calculation of net proceeds due the trust under the forms of the conveyances. The trust does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose the trust to any foreign currency related market risk. Item 8.

Trust Organization and Provisions Hugoton Royalty Trust was created on December 1, 1998 by XTO Energy Inc. (formerly known as “Cross Timbers Oil Company”). Effective on that date, XTO Energy conveyed 80% net profits interests in certain predominantly gas-producing working interest properties in Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming to the trust under separate conveyances for each of the three states. In exchange for the conveyances of the net profits interests to the trust, XTO Energy received 40 million units of beneficial interest in the trust. The trust’s initial public offering was in April 1999. The majority of the underlying working interest properties are currently owned and operated by XTO Energy (Note 7). Bank of America, N.A. is the trustee for the trust. In 2007 the Bank of America private wealth management group officially became known as “U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management.” The legal entity that serves as the trustee of the trust did not change, and references in this Annual Report to U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management shall describe the legal entity Bank of America, N.A. The trust indenture provides, among other provisions, that: - the trust cannot engage in any business activity or acquire any assets other than the net profits interests and specific short-term cash investments; - the trust may dispose of all or part of the net profits interests if approved by 80% of the unitholders, or upon trust termination. Otherwise, the trust may sell up to 1% of the value of the net profits interests in any calendar year, pursuant to notice from XTO Energy of its desire to sell the related underlying properties. Any sale must be for cash with the proceeds promptly distributed to the unitholders; - the trustee may establish a cash reserve for payment of any liability that is contingent or not currently payable; - the trustee may borrow funds to pay trust liabilities if repaid in full prior to further distributions to unitholders; - the trustee will make monthly cash distributions to unitholders (Note 3); and - the trust will terminate upon the first occurrence of: - disposition of all net profits interests pursuant to terms of the trust indenture, - gross proceeds from the underlying properties falling below $1 million per year for two successive years, or - a vote of 80% of the unitholders to terminate the trust in accordance with provisions of the trust indenture. 2. Basis of Accounting The financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis and are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles: - Net profits income is recorded in the month received by the trustee (Note 3). - Trust expenses are recorded based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established by the trustee for liabilities and contingencies. - Distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the trustee (Note 3). The most significant differences between the trust’s financial statements and those prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are: - Net profits income is recognized in the month received rather than accrued in the month of production. - Expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred. - Cash reserves may be established by the trustee for contingencies that would not be recorded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 29 This comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the trust’s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the trust’s financial statements. The initial carrying value of the net profits interests of $247,066,951 was XTO Energy’s historical net book value of the interests on December 1, 1998, the date of the transfer to the trust. Amortization of the net profits interests is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and charged directly to trust corpus. Accumulated amortization was $122,073,185 as of December 31, 2010 and $107,189,371 as of December 31, 2009. 3. Distributions to Unitholders The trustee determines the amount to be distributed to unitholders each month by totaling net profits income, interest income and other cash receipts, and subtracting liabilities paid and adjustments in cash reserves established by the trustee. The resulting amount is distributed to unitholders of record within ten business days after the monthly record date, which is the last business day of the month. Net profits income received by the trustee consists of net proceeds received in the prior month by XTO Energy from the underlying properties, multiplied by 80%. Net proceeds are the gross proceeds received from the sale of production, less costs. Costs generally include applicable taxes, transportation, legal and marketing charges, production expense, development and drilling costs, and overhead (Note 7). XTO Energy, as owner of the underlying properties, computes net profits income separately for each of the three conveyances (one for each of the states of Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming). If costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net profits income from the other conveyances (Note 4). 4. Excess Costs Costs exceeded revenues by $513,475 ($410,780 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests in October and November 2009. Lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests. However, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased gas prices led to the partial recovery of excess costs of $410,957 ($328,766 net to the trust), plus accrued interest of $1,958 ($1,566 net to the trust) in December 2009 and the full recovery of excess costs of $102,518 ($82,014 net to the trust), plus accrued interest of $282 ($226 net to the trust) in January 2010. Costs exceeded revenues by $970,780 ($776,624 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interests in November 2008. Lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interest, however, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased gas prices led to the full recovery of excess costs, plus accrued interest of $3,192 ($2,554 net to the trust) in December 2008. Costs exceeded revenues by $853,468 ($682,774 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interests in November and December 2007. Lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interest, however, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased gas prices led to the full recovery of excess costs, plus accrued interest of $10,090 ($8,072 net to the trust) in February 2008. There were no excess costs as of December 31, 2010. 30 5. Development Costs The following summarizes actual development costs, budgeted development costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income, and the cumulative actual costs compared to the amount deducted: Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Cumulative actual costs under (over) the amount deducted - beginning of period $ 909,477 $ (7,314,084 ) $ (675,754 ) Actual costs (8,969,173 ) (12,776,439 ) (52,638,330 ) Budgeted costs deducted 7,250,000 21,000,000 46,000,000 Cumulative actual costs (over) under the amount deducted - end of period $ (809,696 ) $ 909,477 $ (7,314,084 ) The monthly development cost deduction was $3.75 million from the January 2008 distribution through the August 2008 distribution. Due to higher than anticipated costs as a result of the timing of expenditures, the monthly development cost deduction was increased to $4.0 million beginning with the September 2008 distribution and was maintained at that level through the March 2009 distribution. As a result of decreased development activity and revisions to the 2009 development budget, the development cost deduction was decreased to $2.0 million beginning with the April 2009 distribution, to $1.0 million beginning with the June 2009 distribution and to $500,000 beginning with the September 2009 distribution and was maintained at that level through the July 2010 distribution. As a result of increased development activity, the development cost deduction was increased to $600,000 beginning with the August 2010 distribution and to $850,000 beginning with the October 2010 distribution and was maintained at that level through the remainder of 2010. For further information on 2011 budgeted development costs, see Properties, under Item 2. The monthly deduction is based on the current level of development expenditures, budgeted future development costs and the cumulative actual costs under (over) previous deductions. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that this monthly deduction will continue to be evaluated and revised as necessary. 6. Federal Income Taxes Tax counsel has advised the trust that, under current tax laws, the trust will be classified as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, is not subject to taxation at the trust level. However, the opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. For federal income tax purposes, unitholders of a grantor trust are considered to own the trust’s income and principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the trust is deemed to be received or accrued by the unitholders at the time such income is received or accrued by the trust, rather than when distributed by the trust. The trust is a widely held fixed investment trust (“WHFIT”) classified as a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (“NMWHFIT”) for federal income tax purposes. The trustee is the representative of the trust that will provide tax information in accordance with the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the trust as a WHFIT or a NMWHFIT. 7. XTO Energy Inc. XTO Energy operates approximately 94% of the underlying properties. In computing net proceeds, XTO Energy deducts an overhead charge for reimbursement of administrative expenses on the underlying properties it operates. As of December 31, 2010, the overhead charge was approximately $919,000 ($735,200 net to the trust) per month and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index as defined in the trust agreement. XTO Energy sells a significant portion of natural gas production from the underlying properties to certain of XTO Energy’s wholly owned subsidiaries under contracts in existence when the trust was created, generally at amounts approximating monthly published market prices. Most of the production from the Hugoton area is sold under a contract to Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. (“TGPC”) based on the index price. Much of the gas production in Major County, Oklahoma is sold to Ringwood Gathering Company (“RGC”), which retains approximately $0.31 per Mcf as a compression and gathering fee. TGPC and RGC sell gas to Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc. (“CTES”), which markets gas to third parties. XTO Energy sells directly to CTES most gas production not sold directly to TGPC or RGC.
