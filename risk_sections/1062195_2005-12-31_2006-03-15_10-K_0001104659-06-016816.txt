ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. RISKS RELATED TO 24/7 REAL MEDIA, INC. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN OUR PROFITABILITY. We achieved profitability in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, for the year ended December 31, 2005 but we may not be able to sustain profitability in the future. We incurred net losses of $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. Each of our predecessors had net losses in every year of their operations. We may incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Even if we do maintain profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis in the future. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADE AND INTEGRATE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY. Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our success at upgrading and integrating our existing products and technology. From time to time we upgrade and issue new releases of our existing technology to integrate new functionalities and respond to industry developments. For example, we recently released and are testing a beta version of OAS 6.0, which incorporates our Insight XE and Insight ACT technologies as modules, and future versions of OAS 6.0 may incorporate our Decide DNA technology, as well as functionalities of our OAD solution. We may experience bugs, delays, difficulties or increased costs that could hinder or prevent the successful design, integration, development, introduction or marketing of new releases of our technology. In addition, we must ensure that performance levels of our technology remain steady when we release new versions to our customers. Any material delays in introducing a new release or performance problems could cause us to lose customers and cause our revenue to decline. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS FACE LEGAL AND CULTURAL CHALLENGES AND SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS. We have operations in a number of international markets, including Australia, Canada, Europe Japan and South Korea, and we currently derive more than half our revenue from non-U.S. markets. To date, we have limited experience in marketing, selling and distributing our solutions internationally. Our international operations are subject to other risks, including:  changes in regulatory requirements;  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  potentially adverse tax consequences and restrictions on cash flow resulting from, among other things:  local statutory liquidity requirements for businesses operating in certain foreign countries;  the need to maintain cash balances to meet short-term capital requirements;  operations in foreign countries with higher tax rates than the United States; 22  the inability to utilize certain foreign tax credits; and  the inability to utilize some or all of our losses generated in one or more foreign countries;  general import/export restrictions relating to encryption technology and/or privacy matters;  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;  local law requirements governing employment contracts, which may impose, among other things, minimum notice periods and minimum severance payments for involuntary terminations;  political and economic instability;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world. Any or all of these risks could affect our business outside of the United States and negatively impact our results of operations. OUR SEARCH BUSINESS IS CURRENTLY OUR FASTEST GROWING BUSINESS SEGMENT, AND WE MAY HAVE INEFFICIENCIES IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL OR MAY BE UNABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON CURRENT OR FUTURE SEARCH TRENDS. As companies recognize the value of targeting advertisements to consumers during the search process, SEM services have become increasingly in demand. As a result, our Search segment has been growing faster than our other business segments. The search industry is still relatively new, competition is high and there are no established parameters for the business. We are working to develop set standards as our Search business grows, but we cannot be certain that our current strategies will be successful in the long-run. As a result, it is difficult to predict how our Search segment will perform in the future. For example, revenue in the segment has increased significantly in recent periods, but gross margins have decreased as our lower gross margin managed SEM services business performed better than other, higher margin segments. Further, as we work to develop a long-term business model for Search we may encounter inefficiencies, such as the under or over-delivery of campaigns due to programming difficulties, or set-backs, such as outdated methodologies and tools that must be reconfigured or replaced. There is no guarantee that our current or future Search software and techniques will meet our clients needs, successfully manage increasingly complex campaigns or be profitable for our business. WE ARE UNDERTAKING SEVERAL GLOBAL INITIATIVES IN ORDER TO BETTER LEVERAGE OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR MAY NOT BE BENEFICIAL TO EACH OF THE OFFICES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. In order to realign and better leverage our business we have commenced several global initiatives, including harmonizing our global product lines across the offices in which we operate and creating global standards for product management, development and marketing, which we will continue 23 during the course of 2006. In order to synchronize our various offices and create a uniform worldwide business model we will need to, among other things, set up uniform processes, formalize and build out training courses, set up global information sharing and communication processes, identify and track productivity and cost measurements and identify areas of inefficiency and develop global recovery plans. While we anticipate that the global realignment will have cost and efficiency savings for our business, there is no guarantee that our global efforts will be successful over the long run. Additionally, the global business model that we implement for each of our business segments may not be the ideal standard for each of our offices, and may result in increased costs and decreased savings for particular offices and lines of business throughout our organization. OUR ACQUISITIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO OUR GROWTH, MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PROJECT RESULTS. We were formed in February 1998 to consolidate three Internet advertising companies, and have since acquired or entered into joint ventures with many other companies. Most recently, in September 2005, we formed a joint venture with the advertising company Dentsu to provide our SEM services in Japan. We may continue pursuing selective acquisitions of businesses, technologies and product lines and additional joint ventures as a key component of our growth strategy. If we acquire additional companies or expand our business lines through joint ventures, we will continue to face risks of integrating and improving our financial and management controls, advertisement serving technology, reporting systems, infrastructure and procedures, and expanding, training and managing our work force. This process of integration may take a significant period of time and may require the dedication of global resources, personnel and members of management, on a short or long-term basis, which may distract managements attention from our other operations. Any future acquisition, investment or joint venture may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:  the difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business;  the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  the availability of favorable acquisition financing for future acquisitions; and  the potential loss of key senior managers or employees of any acquired business. Our inability to successfully integrate any acquired company, or failure to achieve any expected synergies of an acquisition or joint venture, could adversely affect our business. OUR FUTURE REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST AND RESULTS IN PRIOR PERIODS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. At times in the past and in certain segments, our revenues have grown significantly and have decreased significantly. Accurate predictions of future revenues are difficult because of the rapid changes in the markets in which we operate. 24 Our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:  the addition of new clients or the loss of existing clients;  changes in fees paid by advertisers or other clients;  changes in the amount of royalties payable by us to owners of Web sites or the imposition of new charges or fees by Web site owners;  the demand by advertisers and Web publishers for our advertising solutions;  the introduction of new Internet marketing services by us or our competitors;  variations in the levels of capital or operating expenditures and other costs relating to the maintenance or expansion of our operations, including personnel costs;  seasonality, which tends to result in lower revenue during the summer months of the third quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year;  changes in results of operations brought about by newly acquired businesses or new joint ventures, which may be exceedingly difficult to predict due to managements lack of history with such businesses or joint ventures;  changes in governmental regulation of the Internet; and  general economic conditions. Our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast due to the above factors and the time we may need to adequately respond to any changes in them. For example, certain of the search engines that we partner with in the management of SEM services may impose additional charges for using their technology interfaces to assist our clients. Our profit margins may suffer if we are unable to pass some of the costs on to our customers. In addition, our expense levels are based in large part on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues. Any increased expenses may precede or may not be followed by increased revenues, as we may be unable to, or may elect not to, adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. As a result, we believe that period-to-period and year-to-year comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. OUR TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE BASED ON OUR PROPRIETARY OPEN ADSYSTEM PLATFORM, AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD SUFFER IF OPEN ADSYSTEM WAS DISRUPTED. Open AdSystem is our proprietary advertisement serving technology and serves as our sole advertisement serving solution. We have developed a variety of products to work on or with this platform, and our Media business also utilizes Open AdSystem technology. We must, among other things, ensure that the technology will continue to function efficiently at high volumes, interact properly with our database, offer the functionality demanded by our customers and assimilate our sales and reporting functions. Customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them, including failures affecting our ability to deliver advertisements or report 25 on advertisement delivery without significant delay. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers, advertising agencies and Web publishers and result in contract terminations, fee rebates and make-goods, thereby reducing our revenue. Slower response time or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our deployed software or hardware due to an increase in the volume of advertising delivered through our servers. To the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. OUR REVENUE COULD DECLINE IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ADVERTISING INVENTORY MADE AVAILABLE TO US, AND OUR GROWTH COULD BE IMPEDED IF WE FAIL TO ACQUIRE ACCESS TO NEW ADVERTISING INVENTORY. Our success depends in part on our ability to effectively manage advertising inventory made available to us. The Web publishers that list their unsold advertising inventory with us are not bound by long-term contracts. In addition, Web publishers can change the amount of inventory they make available to us at any time. If a Web publisher decides not to make advertising space from its Web sites available to us, we may not be able to replace this advertising space with advertising space from other Web sites that have comparable traffic patterns and user demographics quickly enough to fulfill our advertisers requests. This would result in lost revenue. We expect that our customers requirements will become increasingly sophisticated as the Web continues to mature as an advertising medium. If we fail to manage our existing advertising space effectively to anticipate or meet our customers changing requirements, our revenue could decline. Our growth also depends on our ability to expand our advertising inventory. To attract new advertisers, we must maintain a consistent supply of attractive advertising space. We intend to expand our advertising inventory by selectively adding to our network new Web publishers that offer attractive demographics, innovative and quality content and large audiences. Our ability to attract new Web publishers to our network and to retain Web publishers currently in our network will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include our ability to introduce new and innovative product lines and services, our ability to efficiently manage our existing advertising inventory, our pricing policies and the cost-efficiency to Web publishers of outsourcing all or part of their advertising sales. In addition, the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from Web publishers continues to increase. The size of our inventory may not increase or even remain constant in the future, which could cause our advertising revenue to decline significantly. WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS OR ADVERTISING INVENTORY IF WE FAIL TO MEASURE IMPRESSIONS, CLICKS AND ACTIONS ON ADVERTISEMENTS IN A MANNER THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO OUR ADVERTISERS AND WEB PUBLISHERS. We earn advertising revenue and make payments to Web publishers based on the number of impressions, clicks and actions from advertisements delivered on our network. Advertisers and Web publishers willingness to use our services and join our network will depend on the extent to which they perceive our delivery of advertisements and our measurements of clicks to be accurate and reliable. Advertisers and Web publishers often maintain their own technologies and methodologies for counting clicks, and from time to time we have had to resolve differences between our measurements and theirs or regarding over-delivery of advertising impressions. Further, search advertisers are paying much closer attention to allegations of click fraud in the industry generally and have become more willing to inquire about or challenge click counts related to SEM services. Any significant dispute over the proper measurement of clicks or other user responses to advertisements could cause us to lose customers, advertising inventory and revenue, and could substantially reduce the gross profit margin we generate in our media and search businesses. 26 WE DISCLOSE PRO FORMA INFORMATION, WHICH MAY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO AN INVESTORS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose and discuss certain pro forma and other non-GAAP information in the related earnings releases and investor conference calls. This pro forma financial information excludes or may exclude certain special charges and other costs. We believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations. However, we urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and our quarterly earnings releases, and to compare the GAAP financial information to the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls. OUR NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS MAY BE LIMITED. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the availability of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation against taxable income in future periods, which could substantially limit the eventual utilization of these carryforwards. We are currently in the process of finalizing a study to determine the amount of net operating losses and annual limitations. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN IMPAIRMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND/OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. In the course of our operating history, we have acquired and disposed of numerous assets and businesses. Some of our acquisitions have resulted in the recording of a significant amount of goodwill and/or intangible assets on our balance sheet. The goodwill and/or intangible assets were recorded because the fair value of the net assets acquired was less than the purchase price. We may not realize the full value of the goodwill and/or intangible assets. As such, we evaluate on at least an annual basis whether events and circumstances indicate that all or some of the carrying value of goodwill and/or intangible assets are no longer recoverable, in which case we would write off the unrecoverable portion as a charge to our earnings. To improve our operating performance, we may decide to acquire other assets or businesses complementary to our business and, as a result, we may record additional goodwill and/or intangible assets on our balance sheet in the future. The possible write-off of the goodwill and/or intangible assets could negatively impact our future earnings. We will also be required to allocate a portion of the purchase price of any acquisition to the value of any intangible assets that meet the criteria specified in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, such as marketing, customer or contract-based intangibles. The amount allocated to these intangible assets could be amortized over a fairly short period. As a result, our earnings and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. THE SUCCESS OF OUR 24/7 SEARCH OPERATIONS DEPENDS ON A FEW SEARCH ENGINE DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS, AND THE LOSS OF ONE OF THEM COULD RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN OUR 24/7 SEARCH REVENUE. We have generated the majority of our global Search revenue from clicks originating on Google and Overture, which is a subsidiary of Yahoo!, through relationships in many countries in which we operate. We expect that these search engines will continue to generate a majority or more of our 24/7 27 Search revenue for the foreseeable future. The interruption or loss of our relationship with Google or Overture would cause a significant decrease in search revenue. As a result of consolidation among search engines, and other SEM companies, we could lose one or more of our clients or face increased competition from clients that internally develop or acquire capabilities similar to our service. In addition, as our search engine clients operations continue to evolve, we may be required to adjust our business strategy to maintain relationships with our clients. The loss of, or a change in, one or more of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our Search revenue. OUR MAJOR BUSINESS PARTNERS MAY EXPERIENCE ADVERSE BUSINESS CONDITIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. We have entered into a joint venture with Dentsu to promote search engine marketing services in Japan, a strategic business relationship with Lycos, we have major search engine distribution partners, such as Google and Overture, and we may enter into similar relationships with other companies. A substantial portion of our revenue is, directly or indirectly, attributable to these major relationships. If one or more of these companies experiences adverse business conditions that may render them unable to meet our expectations for the strategic business relationship or to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, such an event could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. IF WE LOSE ANY KEY PERSONNEL, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our senior management and key sales and technical personnel, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Executive Officer of Europe. The competition for experienced and talented executives, senior managers and technical and sales personnel has become intense in our industry. The loss of the services of one or more of these persons, other similarly positioned members of management or other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our ability to develop our business. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY AND TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL NEED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND MANAGE OUR COSTS, WHICH WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DO. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and marketing, customer support, financial and accounting, and managerial personnel. We may expand our total workforce and will need to continue to attract qualified personnel in order to grow our business successfully. Additionally, as our business has escalated, we have increased our reliance on contractors and outside firms for development. We may not be able to attract, integrate and retain the numbers and types of candidates that we desire, and we may not be able to retain our contractors and outside firms and may not be able to replace them. Even if we are successful in attracting new staff, we may not be able to increase revenue quickly enough to offset the costs of the additional personnel. Any of these contingencies could cause our business to suffer. We have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, particular difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified SEM staff. Competition for SEM staff is very high, and training is difficult because the required skill set is complex and there is no industry standard. Search is currently one of our fastest growing areas. If we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified search staff, we may not remain competitive in SEM and could lose business and our customers, which could have an adverse effect on revenue. 28 OUR OPERATIONS ARE VULNERABLE TO NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS, BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED BACKUP SYSTEMS. We have limited backup systems and have experienced system failures and electrical outages from time to time in the past, which have disrupted our operations. We have a limited disaster recovery plan in the event of damage from fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer systems against these unexpected adverse events. If any of the foregoing occurs, we may experience a complete system shutdown. Any business interruption insurance that we carry is unlikely to be sufficient to compensate us for loss of business in the event of a significant catastrophe. In addition, interruptions in our services could result from the failure of our telecommunications providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame we require. Our Open AdSystem technology resides on computer systems located in our data centers housed by Equinix and Savvis in the United States and Level 3 Communications in Europe. These systems continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, as a substantial portion of the revenue depend on the continuing availability of these systems. Despite precautions that we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused, and in the future could cause, interruptions in the delivery of our solutions. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations. To improve the performance and to prevent disruption of our services, we may have to make substantial investments to deploy additional servers or one or more copies of our Web sites to mirror our online resources. Although we believe we carry property insurance with adequate coverage limits, our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses, particularly with respect to loss of business and reputation that may occur. In addition, terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage to our employees, facilities, clients, our clients customers and vendors, which could significantly impact our revenues, costs and expenses and financial position. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be presently predicted. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. OUR NETWORK OPERATIONS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO HACKING, VIRUSES AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS, WHICH MAY MAKE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE AND RELIABLE. Internet usage could decline if any well-publicized compromise of security occurs. Hacking involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment. Hackers have made many attempts to breach the security of our network operations, with minimal disruption to date. If hackers are successful in the future, they could misappropriate proprietary information, which could lead to litigation against us, or cause substantial disruptions in our service. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect our Web site against hackers. Any measures we may take may not be effective. In addition, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, as well as materially damage our reputation and decrease our user traffic. 29 WE DEPEND ON PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND WE FACE THE RISK OF INFRINGEMENT. Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks, which we protect through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law. We own three patents in the United States, and have filed and intend to file additional patent applications in the United States. In addition, we apply to register our trademarks in the United States and internationally. Our patent applications and trademark applications may not be approved. Even if they are approved, such patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated. If our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks, our use of such trademarks will be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with such third parties that may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our solutions or technologies. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies, particularly in many foreign countries in which we operate, where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We have, from time to time, been, and may in the future be, subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or by Web publishers with Web sites in our 24/7 Web Alliance, or by customers who employ our Technology solutions. We may be required, or may elect, to indemnify these parties against such claims. Such claims and any resultant litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights. In addition, even if we prevail, such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to defend, and could result in the diversion of our time and attention, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to such claims or litigation unless we enter into arrangements with the third parties responsible for such claims or litigation, which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. From time to time, we may selectively pursue claims of infringement of our patents and other intellectual property rights by third parties. Such claims and any resultant litigation present the risk that a court could determine, either preliminarily or finally, that some of our patents or other intellectual property rights are not valid, which may make it difficult to sell our technology solutions and may lead to a loss of and an inability to generate licensing revenue from our patents. In addition, even if we prevail, such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to pursue, and could result in the diversion of our time and attention, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. WE HAVE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL OVERHANG OF COMMON STOCK AND FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION AND MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 30 As of January 31, 2006, there were approximately 46.6 million shares of our common stock outstanding. As of that date, we also had an aggregate of approximately 14.7 million shares of common stock that may be sold into the market in the future, including approximately 9.6 million shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of options, approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants related to our preferred stock, approximately 2.8 million shares of our common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted shares, and approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and exercise of the related warrants. In addition, if we undertake an additional acquisition or financing involving securities convertible into shares of our common stock, the aggregate number of shares into which those securities are convertible will further increase our overhang. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including the sale of securities convertible into shares of our common stock), or the perception that such sales could occur, or the grant of a large number of options, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO REPAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. On September 26, 2003, we issued to a single holder $15.0 million in principal amount of our 2% subordinated convertible debentures due 2006. On January 1, 2004, we began making semi-annual interest payments, which, thus far, we have elected to pay with cash flow from operations. The entire principal amount of the debentures matures on September 26, 2006. We need to ensure that we will have sufficient cash on hand to cover any portion of the balance that we elect to pay in cash at maturity, or, if the holder elects to exercise its redemption right with respect to $7.5 million in principal amount of the debentures, any amount thereof that we elect to redeem in cash. Our ability to generate cash flow is subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, we may need to, among other things, seek additional financing, refinance or restructure our debt or reduce or issue a large amount of common stock, which, if possible, would be very dilutive or delay planned expenditures. THE TERMS OF THE DEBENTURES HAVE ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS FAVORING THE HOLDER, WHICH DISCOURAGE US FROM ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK MIGHT BE REQUIRED AND WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. The terms of the debentures provide that, subject to certain exceptions, if, for financing purposes, we issue or sell any shares of our common stock at a price less than the conversion price of the debentures, which is $8.75 per share of our common stock, the conversion price of the debentures will be reduced to the price at which we issue new shares. This device, which is anti-dilutive for the debenture holder, may discourage us from engaging in a transaction that might otherwise be beneficial to our security holders, if we would be required to issue common stock at a price below $8.75 per share. THE POWER OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DESIGNATE AND ISSUE SHARES OF STOCK COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 350,000,000 shares of common stock for such consideration as they may consider sufficient, without seeking stockholder approval. The issuance of 31 additional shares of common stock in the future would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of current stockholders. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights and preferences of which our Board of Directors may designate without stockholder approval. The designation and issuance of preferred stock in the future could create additional securities with dividend and liquidation preferences prior in right of payment to the outstanding shares of common stock. EFFECTS OF ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS COULD INHIBIT THE ACQUISITION OF OUR COMPANY. Some of the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our By-laws and Delaware law could, among other things, together or separately:  discourage, delay or prevent potential acquisition proposals;  discourage, delay or prevent transactions involving an actual or threatened change in control;  impede the ability of our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year; and  limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. These provisions may apply even if the action that is limited or prevented might be in the best interest of our shareholders. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY FUTURE CASH DIVIDENDS. We currently do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the near future. We may never pay cash dividends or distributions on our common stock. In addition, the terms of our debentures restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and any other factors that the Board of Directors decides is relevant. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY MAY HINDER OUR GROWTH. The markets for Internet advertising and related products and services are intensely competitive and such competition is expected to increase. Our failure to compete successfully may hinder our growth. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:  the development of new online advertising media and methods;  the timing and market acceptance of new products and enhancements of existing services developed by us and our competitors;  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 32  changing demands regarding customer service and support;  shifts in sales and marketing efforts by us and our competitors; and  the ease of use, performance, price and reliability of our services and products. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than ours. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients. In addition, most online advertising companies are seeking to broaden their business models, so that companies that do not currently compete directly with us may decide to compete more directly with us in the future. We may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors. CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD DECREASE OUR REVENUES AND INCREASE OUR COSTS. Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications, commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent, and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the United States Congress and state legislatures. Any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the Internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications, commercial and advertising medium. State governments or governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities. The laws governing the Internet, however, remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the Internet and Internet advertising. In addition, the growth and development of Internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, which may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the Internet. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet. CHANGES IN LAWS AND STANDARDS RELATING TO DATA COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES AND THE PRIVACY OF INTERNET USERS, OR RELATED LITIGATION, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. The U.S. federal and various state governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding Internet users. In 2004 and 2005, the U.S. Congress proposed several new pieces of legislation that would limit the use of technologies deemed to be spyware, which some bills have defined to include cookies, Web beacons and javascript, which are required by our products and services. The effectiveness of our Open AdSystem products and services could be significantly limited by federal and state regulations limiting the collection or use of information regarding Internet users. Since many of the proposed federal and state laws or regulations are being developed, we cannot yet determine the impact these regulations may have on our business. In addition, growing public concern about privacy and the collection, distribution and use of personal information has led to self-regulation of these practices by the Internet advertising and direct marketing industry, and to increased federal and state regulation. Lastly, a number of civil actions have been brought by federal and 33 state authorities against companies alleged to have distributed spyware without the proper consent of users. The Network Advertising Initiative, of which we are a member, has developed self-regulatory principles for online preference marketing. We are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection, distribution and use of personal information. These laws include the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act and state laws that limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information, as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit information. While we monitor legislative initiatives, in the event that more onerous federal or state laws or regulations are enacted or applied to us or to our clients, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. PRIVACY CONCERNS MAY PREVENT US FROM COLLECTING USER DATA. Growing concerns about the use of cookies and data collection may limit our ability to develop user profiles. Web sites typically place small files of information, commonly known as cookies, on a users hard drive, generally without the users knowledge or consent. Cookie information is passed to the Web site through the Internet users browser software. Our Open AdSystem technology enables the use of cookies and other non-personally-identifying information to deliver targeted advertising and to limit the frequency with which an advertisement is shown to a user. Most currently available Internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive, and Microsoft Corporation changed the design and instrumentation of its Web browser to give users the option to accept or reject third-party cookies. A small minority of users are currently choosing to prevent certain cookies. Users can also delete cookies from their hard drive or modify them at any time. Some Internet commentators and privacy advocates have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. Any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies or increase in the number of users blocking cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and impair our profiling and targeting capabilities. Such changes also could adversely affect our ability to determine the reach of advertising campaigns sold and delivered by us and the frequency with which users of sites in the 24/7 Web Alliance see the same advertisement. If the use or effectiveness of cookies is limited, we would likely have to switch to other technology that would allow us to gather demographic and behavioral information. While such technology currently exists, it is substantially less effective than cookies. Replacement of cookies could require significant engineering time and resources, might not be completed in time to avoid negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations, and might not be commercially feasible. WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. The Internet and Internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions and changing customer demands. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address our customers changing demands. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design, development, introduction or marketing of our solutions. In addition, our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance. Material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors. 34 In addition, the development of commercial software and technology that blocks, eliminates or otherwise screens out Internet advertising may reduce the value of advertising inventory on our 24/7 Web Alliance and the benefits of our technology solutions to our customers. We cannot guarantee that a new commercial software or technology, for end-users or enterprises, will not be capable of eliminating a portion or all of the advertisement formats, including banners, pop-ups, pop-unders and other formats, that we utilize through our 24/7 Web Alliance or that we currently deliver through our technology solutions. To the extent that our customers refuse to pay for advertisements that are blocked, or if the use of blocking software exceeds our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
