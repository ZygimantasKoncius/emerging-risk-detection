Item 1A. RISK FACTORS This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2006 in Managements discussion and analysis. These statements use such words as may, will, expect, believe and plan. They reflect our expectations about the future and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update or revise them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. By far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is also highly fragmented and competitive. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. We also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under conventional franchise, license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our plan, as described below, to reduce our ownership of restaurants may be difficult to achieve for many reasons, and the change in ownership mix may not affect our results as we now expect. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate, as well as our results. In particular, the increasing focus on nutrition presents challenges for our menu development and marketing plans and may adversely affect our sales and costs of doing business. These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance. Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we have designed and execute against the Plan to Win. We developed the Plan to Win to address the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:  Our ability to anticipate and respond to trends or other factors that affect the informal eating out market and our competitive position in the various markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, consumer food preferences, publicity about our products or operations that can drive consumer perceptions, as well as our success in planning and executing initiatives to address these trends and factors or other competitive pressures;  The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires the trust and confidence of our customers;  Our ability to respond effectively to adverse consumer perceptions about the quick-service segment of the informal eating out market, our products or the reliability of our supply chain and the safety of the commodities we use, particularly beef and chicken;  The success of our plans for 2006 and beyond to improve existing products and to roll-out new products and product line extensions, as well as the impact of our competitors actions in response to our product improvements and introductions and our ability to continue robust product development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations;  Our ability to achieve an overall product mix that differentiates the McDonalds experience and balances consumer value with margin expansion, including in markets where cost or pricing pressures may be significant;  The impact of pricing, marketing and promotional plans on product sales and margins and on our ability to target these efforts effectively to maintain or expand market share; McDonalds Corporation 5  The impact of events such as public boycotts, labor strikes, price increases or other actions involving our vendors or distribution centers, natural disasters or other calamities that can adversely affect our supply chain and margins as well as the ability of our vendors or distribution centers to perform.  Our ability to drive improvements in our restaurants, recruit qualified restaurant personnel and motivate employees to achieve sustained high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet their expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments;  Whether our restaurant remodeling and rebuilding efforts will foster sustained increases in comparable sales for the affected restaurants and yield our desired return on our capital investment; and  Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way. Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns, while meeting our business needs and customer expectations. Our plans call for a reduction in Company-operated restaurants in the U.K. by re-franchising them to third parties, as well as the pursuit of a developmental license model in between 15 to 20 additional markets and organizational changes to improve the performance of Company-operated restaurants in other markets, notably Canada. Whether and when we can achieve these plans, as well as their success, is uncertain and depends mainly on the following:  Our ability to identify prospective franchisees and licensees with the experience and financial resources to be effective operators of McDonalds restaurants;  Whether there are regulatory or other constraints that restrict or prevent our ability to implement our plans or increase our costs;  How quickly we re-franchise or enter into developmental licenses, which we expect will vary by market and could also vary significantly from period to period;  Whether the three-year period during which we plan to make these changes will be sufficient to achieve them; and  Changes in the operating or legal environment and other circumstances that cause us to delay or revise our plans to alter our ownership mix. Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income. Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following:  Our ability to manage fluctuations in commodity prices, interest and foreign exchange rates and the effects of local governmental initiatives to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending and inflation rates;  The impact of labor costs on our margins, given our labor-intensive business model and the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets;  The effects of local governmental initiatives to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending or wage and inflation rates;  Our ability to develop effective initiatives in underperforming markets, such as the U.K., which is experiencing a highly competitive informal eating out market and low consumer confidence levels, Japan, which is experiencing slow economic growth and a challenging informal eating out market and South Korea, which is experiencing improving, yet still low consumer confidence levels;  The nature and timing of management decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that can result in material impairment charges that reduce our earnings; and  The success of our strategy in China, where we are planning significant growth, including our ability to identify and secure appropriate real estate sites and to manage the costs and profitability of our growth in light of competitive pressures and other operating conditions that may limit pricing flexibility. Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has significantly increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face are the following:  The difficulty of achieving compliance with often conflicting regulations in multiple state or national markets and the potential impact of new or changing regulation 6 McDonalds Corporation that affects or restricts elements of our business, such as possible changes in regulations relating to advertising to children or nutritional labeling;  Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition of our products or the appropriateness or accuracy of our advertising or other communications;  The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which are constantly evolving and often contradictory in their implications, but nonetheless drive consumer perceptions, litigation and regulation in ways that are material to our business;  The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions involving consumers and shareholders, labor and employment matters or landlord liability and the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings and the possibility of settlements or judgments;  Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from government actions, including price controls, limitations on the import or export of commodities we use or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors operations;  The risks of operating in markets, such as Brazil and China, in which there are significant uncertainties, including with respect to the application of legal requirements and the enforceability of laws and contractual obligations;  The risks associated with information security and the use of cashless payments, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy, consumer protection and other laws, costs resulting from consumer fraud and the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments increases; and  The impact of changes in accounting principles or practices (or related legal or regulatory interpretations or our critical accounting estimates), including changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or interpretations thereof), which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions or events, such as the impact of weather conditions and natural disasters. Market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events (such as recent reports about the potential spread of avian flu) can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully. Item 1B.
