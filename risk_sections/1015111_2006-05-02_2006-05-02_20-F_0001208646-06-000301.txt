Risk Factors Potential investors should carefully consider the following specific risk factors along with the other information contained in this annual report before deciding to invest in the SGL Shares. Each of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, each of these risks could cause our share price to decline, and investors could lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. The order in which the following risk factors are presented is not an indication of the likelihood of their occurrence. Our business is affected by the uncertainties of economic and political conditions. Conditions in domestic and global economies have a strong impact on our business operations. Numerous factors, such as global or regional political conflicts, have a continous impact on macroeconomic parameters and the international capital markets. The uncertainty of economic and political conditions can have a direct impact on the demand for our products and can also influence our planning and forecasting ability. This is particularly the case for our products where we operate under global market conditions, such as graphite electrodes for the steel industry, cathodes for the aluminum industry, carbon electrodes for the silicon-metal industry, graphite specialties supplied to the semiconductor industry and industrial applications including carbon ceramic brake discs supplied to the automotive industry, process equipment for the chemical industry and structural parts and carbon fibers supplied to the aviation industry. We face substantial pricing pressure from our competitors. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and customer service. Most of our production process is capital intensive, which results in high fixed costs. The pricing pressure thus has a direct impact on our results. In addition, price decreases can be aggravated by temporary imbalances in supply and demand, with an oversupply in stagnating markets. Graphite electrodes, in particular, are subject to strong price competition. In 2005 the average price of our graphite electrodes increased in local currency 5% in Euro and 13% in US$ versus 2004. Our market share could be adversely affected if we increase prices, or a competitor reduces prices, or if we decide to maintain profit margins rather than market share or pursue other competitive strategies. Continuing competition could either prevent us from raising prices, as necessary to offset higher production costs, force price reductions, or reduce our sales volumes and revenues. It could also require us to spend more for sales, marketing and research and development. Any of these developments could substantially harm our financial condition and results of operations. The industries that use graphite electrodes are cyclical, and declines in demand for graphite electrodes could adversely affect our business. In 2005, we derived approximately 49% of our sales revenue from the sale of graphite electrodes, our core business. We sell our graphite electrodes primarily to the electric arc furnace (or EAF) steel industry. The EAF industry is global and customers are located in every major geographic market. As a result, our customers are affected by changes in global and regional economic conditions. This, in turn, affects the demand for and the price of our graphite electrodes, which are 9 Back to Contents sold to customers in the EAF industry. The most recent economic slowdown in the steel industry, and in particular, the structural crisis in the U.S. steel industry led to an overall drop in the demand for graphite electrodes until mid-2002. As a result of the structural crisis in the steel industry, a consolidation of the steel and graphite industries occured, with the elimination of several competitors in both industries, and consequently a decline in demand. Accompanying this decline in demand was also the shift in demand from a large number of customers to a smaller number of larger companies, with increased pressure on our product pricing. With the end of the slowdown in the steel industry in mid-2002 the economic conditions for graphite electrodes producers improved with demand and prices increasing. The market for graphite electrodes, particularly in Europe and North America, is mature and expands in line with overall economic growth and with an increase in the proportion of EAF steel to total steel production. On the other hand, opportunities for growth do exist in Asian markets, although we have not had a substantial presence in these markets up to now. In addition, demand for our graphite electrodes sold to the EAF steel industries may be adversely affected by technological improvements in those electrodes as well as in the manufacturing operations of our customers, which reduce the rate of consumption or use of our electrodes for a given level of production. Since the early 1980s there has been a steady gradual decrease in “specific consumption”  the quantity of graphite electrodes consumed per metric ton of steel produced  due to improved efficiency in EAF steelmaking processes and equipment design. Since the mid-1990s, increased EAF steel production has offset the decrease in specific consumption, resulting in steady to slightly increasing demand for graphite electrodes. Despite the overall long-term trend, the year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in the demand for graphite electrodes have been significant. We cannot assure you that future improvements in steelmaking processes and technology or a decline in EAF steel production will not result in a net decrease in demand for graphite electrodes. A significant drop in demand for our graphite electrodes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have substantial amounts of debt. This debt, along with the obligations and covenants contained in our financing arrangements, limits our financial and operating flexibility. For a detailed description of our debt, you should read the discussion under the captions “Capitalization” and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The conditions of our new syndicated credit facility, as well as the conditions of the senior notes substantially limit our financial flexibility. In particular, these agreements (see detailed description in Item 10, “Additional Information  Material Contracts”) place limits on our ability to incur new debt, grant security to third persons, dispose of material assets, take organizational measures such as mergers, changes of corporate form, joint ventures or similar transactions, or to enter into transactions with related parties. Other limitations generally concern the payment of dividends and the repurchase of own shares. In addition, we must meet a number of financial covenants in the context of our financing agreements. Our substantial debt and our compliance with the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further more, we continue to require significant funds for our operations, financing costs, the payment of the remaining antitrust liabilities and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate or obtain sufficient funds needed for our future operations and our other cash requirements, or that we will meet all loan covenants and other obligations in connection with our present financing arrangements. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our financial liabilities as they mature or that we will be able to negotiate the same or better terms in future loan agreements. In addition we cannot assure you that we will not have to incur additional debt in the future. Incurring such additional debt could further increase the risks regarding our debt and financing arrangements. 10 Back to Contents We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on or repay our debt and to fund our working capital requirements depends on the availability of financial resources. Our ability to generate cash will depend on our future operating performance, as well as on general economic, financial, competitive, market and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, our ability to generate adequate cash will depend at least in part on: • a price increase in the carbon and graphite electrode industry, as well as our ability to maintain and grow our sales revenues in most of our business segments; • our ability to contain costs and implement further cost savings through our restructuring programs and cost saving initiatives; and • our ability to realize earnings from new technologies and products. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts as they become due or to fund our other liquidity requirements. We are party to several antitrust court proceedings. In the past several years, we have faced various court actions and investigations in connection with antitrust violations and have been assessed substantial fines by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Canadian antitrust authorities and the European Commission for price fixing in the graphite electrode industry, the specialty graphite industry and in the area of electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite products. As of December 31, 2005, all fines raised by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Canadian antitrust authorities have been paid in full. In July 2001, December 2002 and December 2003 the European Commission fined us for violating antitrust laws with respect to graphite electrodes, specialty graphites and in the area of electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite products, respectively. In April 2004, the European Court of First Instance reduced the fine imposed in 2001 in the graphite electrode proceedings from €80.2 million to €69.1 million. In June 2005, the European Court of First Instance reduced the fine imposed in 2002 in the specialty graphite proceedings from €27.75 million to €18.45 million. Since the judgment of the European Court of First Instance failed to address either the censured gross procedural errors or the internationally recognized prohibition against double jeopardy, we have filed an appeal to the European Court of Second Instance for both proceedings. Regarding the third fine imposed in 2003 we have appealed before the European Court of First Instance. In 2004, the third fine (€23.9 million including interest) was deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account of the antitrust authorities until the closure of the legal proceedings. In April 2006 we further deposited an amount of €88.9 million covering the present level of the first fine including interest in an interest bearing escrow account of the antitrust authorities until the final decisions of the courts are made. As part of our accounting procedures we continually review our provisions for antitrust fines and adjust them if necessary. Our Board of Management believes that these provisions, which are below the €111.2 million aggregate amount of fines, are sufficient as of December 31, 2005 to cover any potential liabilities that finally could arise from these antitrust proceedings. In addition, we have made significant payments in the past several years in defending against and settling a number of civil suits seeking damages as a result of violations of antitrust laws. The majority of these civil suits have been concluded by now; however, there are a number of legal proceedings remaining. See “Business Description  Legal proceedings  Civil suits resulting from antitrust violations.” We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. Despite intensive internal legal training and establishing compliance policies, we cannot assure you that we or certain of our subsidiaries or affiliates will not become subject to antitrust investigations by the relevant authorities and will not be required to pay additional fines or be subject to claims for damages from third parties for violations of applicable antitrust laws. An unfavorable result in any of these future or current proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 11 Back to Contents In addition we will be in default under the credit agreements if any new antitrust proceedings are instituted against any member of the SGL Group or if we receive any antitrust fines in an aggregate amount exceeding €2.5 million. However, before accelerating the Facilities the parties will enter into negotiations in good faith for a period not exceeding thirty days. We are exposed to currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks. We generate a significant portion of our sales revenue in U.S. dollars. As a result, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro will have a negative impact on our sales revenue, which are recorded in euro. Compared to the sales revenue that we generate in U.S. dollars, we incur a relatively small portion of our cost of sales in U.S. dollars. As a result, a U.S. dollar that is weak compared to the euro will have a negative impact on our gross profit and therefore on our result. A medium-to long-term decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and other currencies could also weaken our competitive position as compared to competitors who incur a relatively larger portion of their cost of sales in U.S. dollars. During the period of 2002 to 2004 the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro has declined, while during 2005 the U.S. dollar has strengthen against the euro. We cannot predict any trends for the future. We have entered into hedging arrangements for the majority of our U.S. dollar transaction exposure in Europe for 2006 to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. However, these hedging arrangements can protect us only to a limited extent against a long-term decline of the U.S. dollar. See “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Overview  Currency exchange exposure”. As a result of our issuance of senior notes the average interest rate of our total debt has and will further increase. Under both our current and our new syndicated credit facility the interest rate consists of a combination of a variable basic interest rate and a margin that can be adjusted according to our ability to meet certain fixed financial ratios. Any change in the basic interest rate or in the margin will either increase or decrease our interest rate burden. In order to limit this exposure we have entered into certain interest rate hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. However, these instruments can protect us only to a limited extent against any long-term increase in interest rates. We operate globally and face unpredictable international economic conditions, government policies, regulatory controls and changes in public policy that could adversely affect our business. We operate 33 major manufacturing facilities, which are located in Europe, North America and Asia (China) and sell our products in approximately 100 countries. In 2005, sales revenue of our products outside Germany accounted for approximately 87% of our total sales revenue. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, declines in regional or global economic activity, limitations, if any, on the conversion of foreign currencies into euro, and the possible imposition of investment and other restrictions by governments. In addition, our business is subject to changes in the public policies of individual countries or states, including potential increases in taxes and tax rates. We must comply with a broad range of regulatory controls on the testing, manufacture and marketing of our products. In some countries, including the United States and member states of the European Union, regulatory controls have become increasingly demanding. We expect that this trend will continue. A proposed new European Union chemicals policy could mandate a significant increase in the testing and assessment of basic chemicals and chemical intermediates, leading to increased costs and reduced operating margins for these products. Although many regulations and policies increase our costs, changes in public policy and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the Group during the past decade. However, we cannot assure you that changes in policies or regulations will not harm our operating results or financial condition in the future. We have made substantial investments in new business areas in the past several years in order to diversify our product portfolio. The success of this strategy depends on the successful development and commercialization of new products, in particular in the SGL Technologies business area. Our strategy of product portfolio diversification, which we have pursued through our investments into new business areas, requires the successful development of new products, as well as 12 Back to Contents the setting up of a new distribution and marketing network in order for us to be able to tap into new, non-established markets. We are entering into new business areas  in particular with our high technology segment SGL Technologies  in which we have little experience and which are subject to rapid product developments and changes. In the past years, we have made substantial investments into our business area SGL Technologies. For the past three years, the sales revenue for this business area have fluctuated, and we have incurred net operating losses until 2004 followed by a break-even result in 2005. Any growth in sales and any increase in profitability in this business area will depend largely on whether and how fast our newly developed products will be able to prevail in the market. We may encounter supply shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy. The largest portion of our cost of sales, next to personnel costs, is accounted for by raw materials and energy. We are exposed to commodity price risks through our dependence on various raw materials, such as petroleum coke, coal tar pitch, petroleum pitch, anthracite coal and natural graphite flake as well as energy supplies. We purchase raw material and energy from a variety of sources and generally do not enter into long-term purchase contracts. The principal raw material we use in the manufacture of our products is petroleum coke, an engineered by-product of petroleum refining. The market for petroleum coke, in particular needle coke, is marked by a small number of large suppliers with substantial market influence and the possibility of further consolidations. Although we believe that the raw materials we require will remain available in adequate quantities, the availability and price of raw materials and energy may be affected by new regulations, suppliers allocations, interruptions in production by suppliers and market conditions. High energy prices continue to significantly influence our costs of production. Although we have reduced the impact of price increases for energy and raw materials through increased efficiency and cost savings, we cannot assure you that we will be able to mitigate any future price increases in the same way. A substantial increase in raw material or energy prices, or a continued interruption in energy supplies, could substantially harm our financial condition and results of operations. Our pension and retirement obligations could significantly exceed the existing provisions and funding status of these obligations. We have obligations toward our employees with regard to benefits for the time after the employment relationship has terminated, such as retirement payments, life insurance and medical insurance. These benefit plans consist of both defined contribution and defined benefit plans and vary from country to country in which we maintain such plans. Changes and movements in the equity, fixed income, real estate and other markets could significantly change the valuation of the assets of our plans. A change in the yield assumptions used also has an impact on the calculation of the discounted present value of our pension obligations. In addition, changes in pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions, such as rates for compensation increase, retirement rates, mortality rates, health care cost trends and other factors can lead to significant increases or decreases in our pension or postretirement benefit obligations. This would affect the reported funded status of our plans and therefore could also negatively affect net periodic pension cost, future cash contributions and equity. For further details on the funding status of pensions and other post-retirement benefit obligations, see Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report. We cannot assure you that any future expenses or cash contributions that become necessary under our pension or postretirement benefit plans will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Environmental matters could result in significant increases in costs. Our operations are subject to various risks associated with manufacturing, including the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. We are also subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of potentially hazardous substances and wastes (see “Business Description  Government regulation”). Environmental and health laws and regulations could lead to the possibility of substantial fines, revocation of applicable permits or orders for 13 Back to Contents environmental cleanup. Any violations of these laws or regulations, or any adjustments to comply with changing laws or regulations, could result in significant expenditures. Environmental laws in particular have continuously been tightened in the past several years. We also expect a potential tightening of environmental laws in those countries that are joined the European Union in 2004 in which we have facilities. As a result, we cannot assure you, that a known, previously unknown or future contamination event, or any new, more stringent regulations or their enforcement by the relevant authorities will not increase our environmental costs in the future. A significant increase in environmental liabilities or costs could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. Prolonged work stoppages due to labor disputes could adversely affect our business. Most of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although we believe that we have satisfactory relations with our works councils and unions, we cannot assure you that we will reach new agreements on satisfactory terms when existing collective bargaining agreements expire. Nor can we assure you that we would reach such new agreements without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. If industrial actions substantially obstructed our manufacturing operations for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer material harm. Disruptions of the business operations, strikes or similar measures at our customers or suppliers sites could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to protect the intellectual property critical for the development of SGL Technologies business. We own over 300 patents registered in the United States, Europe and in other major world markets, and have over 350 patent applications pending for new technologies and processes. In addition, we have obtained licenses to various domestic and foreign patents. We generally have a number of new patent applications or trademark registration applications pending at any given time relating to product enhancements and new product developments. We do not believe that the success of our established businesses is materially dependent on trade secrets, know-how, patents, trademarks or other proprietary information. However, in the future, competitors may obtain patents for technologies whose use by our competitors could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The new product lines that we are developing in our SGL Technologies business do rely to a significant extent on such proprietary rights and information. We cannot assure you that any patents or trademarks that we obtain will adequately protect the covered products and technologies. Nor can we assure you that our confidentiality covenants and agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information not covered by patents or trademarks, or that others will not obtain this information through independent development or other legal means. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that our activities will not infringe on the proprietary rights of others or that we will be able to obtain licenses, on reasonable terms or otherwise, to technology that we need. In addition, we cannot assure you that our proprietary rights and information will not become obsolete as a result of the development of new technologies by our competitors. If we fail to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or to protect our proprietary information, or if we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, the business, financial condition or results of operations of our SGL Technologies business could suffer significant harm. Existing insurance coverage may prove inadequate. We aim to cover foreseeable material risks by insurance. Our insurance coverage, however, may prove inadequate to fully cover the risks to which the SGL Group is exposed. For certain risks, adequate insurance coverage may not be available on the market or at reasonable conditions. Our sales revenues are exposed to credit default risks. For this reason and insofar as possible, we cover this risk through insurance to a certain extent (which is limited, for example, in the United States). We use a variety of instruments for this purpose, such as pre-payment, payment guarantees, 14 Back to Contents confirmed letters of credit and credit insurance. We cannot assure you that payment shortfalls from customers (particularly in the steel industry) will not occur in the future. 15 Back to Contents
