Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other risks described in this report, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects: 1. If we are unable to attract and retain independent associates, our business may suffer. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to attract and retain a large active base of independent associates and members who purchase our packs and products. We cannot give any assurances that the productivity of our independent associates will continue at their current levels or increase in the future. Several factors affect our ability to attract and retain a significant number of independent associates and members, including:  on-going motivation of our independent associates;  general economic conditions;  significant changes in the amount of commissions paid;  public perception and acceptance of the wellness industry;  public perception and acceptance of network-marketing;  public perception and acceptance of our business and our products, including any negative publicity;  the limited number of people interested in pursuing network-marketing as a business;  our ability to provide proprietary quality-driven products that services the market demands; and  competition in recruiting and retaining independent associates. 2. The loss of key high-level independent associates could negatively impact our associate growth and our revenue. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 575,000 independent associates and members who purchased our products within the last 12 months. Approximately 382 independent associates occupied the highest associate level under our global compensation plan as of that date. These independent associates, together with their extensive networks of downlines, account for substantially all of our revenue. As a result, the loss of a high-level independent associate or a group of leading associates in the independent associates networks of downlines, whether by their own choice or through disciplinary actions by us for violations of our policies and procedures, could negatively impact our associate growth and our revenue. 3. If we incur substantial liability from litigation, complaints, or enforcement actions or incur liabilities or penalties resulting from misconduct by our independent associates, our financial condition could suffer. Routine enforcement actions and complaints are common in our industry. Although we fully cooperate with regulatory agencies and use various means to address misconduct by our independent associates, including maintaining policies and procedures to govern the conduct of our independent associates and conducting training seminars, it is still difficult to detect and correct all instances of misconduct. Violations of our policies and procedures by our independent associates could lead to litigation, formal or informal complaints, enforcement actions, and inquiries by various federal, state, or foreign regulatory authorities against us and/or our independent associates. Because we have expanded into foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our independent associates differ due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business. Any future litigation, complaints, and enforcement actions involving us and/or our independent associates could consume considerable amounts of financial and other corporate resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, profitability, and growth prospects. 23 Table of Contents 4. Challenges by private parties to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business. We may be subject to challenges by private parties, including our independent associates and members, to the form of our network marketing system or elements of our business. In the United States, the network marketing industry and regulatory authorities have generally relied on the implementation of distributor rules and policies designed to promote retail sales to protect consumers and to prevent inappropriate activities and to distinguish between legitimate network marketing distribution plans and unlawful pyramid schemes. We have adopted rules and policies based on case law, rulings of the FTC, discussions with regulatory authorities in several states, and domestic and global industry standards. Legal and regulatory requirements concerning network marketing systems, however, involve a high level of subjectivity, are inherently fact-based and are subject to judicial interpretation. Because of the foregoing, we can provide no assurance that we would not be harmed by the application or interpretation of statutes or regulations governing network marketing, particularly in any civil challenge by a current or former independent associate or member. 5. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights of our products, our business could suffer. Our success and competitive position largely depends on our ability to protect the following proprietary rights:  Ambrotose® complex, a glyconutritional dietary supplement ingredient consisting of a blend of monosaccharides, or sugar molecules, used in the majority of our products;  MTech AO Blend, our proprietary, patent-pending antioxidant used in Ambrotose AO®; and  A compound used in our reformulated Advanced Ambrotose that allows for a more potent concentration of the full range of mannose-containing polysaccharides occurring naturally in aloe. We have filed patent applications for Ambrotose® complex in the United States and certain other countries, and as of December 31, 2007, we have obtained over 43 patents for Ambrotose® complex, five of which were issued in the United States and the remainder in 29 foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our independent associates, suppliers, manufacturers, directors, officers, and consultants to help protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, we continue to face the risk that our patent protection for Ambrotose® complex will be denied or that the patent protection we are granted is more limited than originally requested. As a precaution, we consult with outside legal counsel and consultants to help ensure that we diligently protect our proprietary rights to minimize this risk. However, our business, profitability, and growth prospects could be adversely affected if we fail to receive adequate protection of our proprietary rights. 6. Adverse or negative publicity, including the publicity related to the lawsuit filed against us by the Texas Attorney General, could cause our business to suffer. Our business depends, in part, on the publics perception of our integrity and the safety and quality of our products. Any adverse publicity could negatively affect the publics perception about our industry, our products, or our reputation and could result in a significant decline in our operations and/or the number of our independent associates. Specifically, we are susceptible to adverse or negative publicity regarding:  the nutritional supplements industry;  skeptical consumers;  competitors;  the safety and quality of our products and/or our ingredients;  regulatory investigations of our products or our competitors products;  the actions of our independent associates; and  the direct selling/network-marketing industry. 24 Table of Contents On July 5, 2007, the Texas Attorney General filed suit against us, MannaRelief Ministries, Samuel L. Caster, the Fisher Institute, and H. Reginald McDaniel alleging violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Texas Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The lawsuit created a substantial amount of adverse publicity. The effects of that adverse publicity cannot be fully determined at this time, but the publicity may have a negative impact on our business. We have taken a number of actions to address concerns raised by the Texas Attorney Generals action and will continue to fully cooperate with the Texas Attorney Generals office to resolve this matter. We cannot predict at this time, however, what the possible outcome would be of any resolution or court proceeding. 7. The ultimate outcome of pending securities litigation and shareholder derivative lawsuits is uncertain. We and some of our officers were named in three similar purported securities class action lawsuits. The complaints in these actions, which have been consolidated into one action, allege violations of Sections 10(b), Rule 10b-5 and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act through alleged artificial inflation of the value of our stock by knowingly allowing independent contractors to recklessly misrepresent the efficacy of our products during the purported class period and seek an unspecified award of damages. We have filed a motion to dismiss which is currently pending. We have also been sued in five shareholder derivative lawsuits. Three of these actions where filed shortly after the commencement of the class action litigation and make allegations similar to those in the class action litigation described above. The Special Litigation Committee appointed by our independent directors has determined that it is in our best interest to dismiss these three lawsuits, and we have filed a motion to dismiss the two active cases. The third case has been administratively closed by the Court. The other two actions make allegations with regard to our funding of various research projects. The Special Litigation Committee has determined that it is not in our best interest to allow the continuation of these two actions. The plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative lawsuits seek an unspecified amount of damages. The parties to the three purported class action lawsuits and to the five shareholder derivative lawsuits attended mediation on November 20, 2007. Settlement negotiations between the parties are ongoing. While we do not believe that any of these litigation matters alone or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period. Further, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed summary of these lawsuits. 8. If we are exposed to product liability claims, we may be liable for damages and expenses, which could affect our overall financial condition. We could face financial liability due to certain product liability claims if the use of our products results in significant loss or injury. We make no assurances that we will not be exposed to any substantial future product liability claims. Such claims may include claims that our products contain contaminants, that we provide our independent associates and consumers with inadequate instructions regarding product use, or that we provide inadequate warnings concerning side effects or interactions of our products with other substances. We believe that our suppliers and manufacturers maintain adequate product liability insurance coverage. However, a substantial future product liability claim could exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of an existing insurance policy, which could adversely affect our overall future financial condition. In recent years a discovery of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), commonly referred to as Mad Cow Disease, has caused concern among the general public. As a result, some countries have banned the importation or sale of products that contain bovine materials sourced from locations where BSE has been identified. We have certain products that use a beef-based gelatin capsule. All of our gelatin capsules are 25 Table of Contents currently produced in the United States or in Australia, which are considered BSE-free countries, although a few cases have been identified in the United States. Nonetheless, in 2006, we voluntarily began to switch most of our production to utilize non-bovine gelatin capsules that are vegetable-based rather than beef-based. However, future government action could require companies to use vegetable-based capsules or other capsules, and if required, the costs of vegetable-based or other capsules could increase our costs as compared to the costs of bovine-based capsules. The higher costs could affect our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows. 9. If our outside suppliers and manufacturers fail to supply products in sufficient quantities and in a timely fashion, our business could suffer. Outside manufacturers make all of our products. For both 2007 and 2006, we purchased 100% of a suppliers Australia Plum Powder, which is used in our Ambrotose AO® product. During 2007 and 2006, we purchased approximately 31% and 29%, respectively, of one of our manufacturers production. Our profit margins and timely product delivery are dependent upon the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to supply us with products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Our ability to enter new markets and sustain satisfactory levels of sales in each market depends on the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to produce the ingredients and products and to comply with all applicable regulations. As a precaution, we have approved alternate suppliers and manufacturers for our products. However, the failure of our primary suppliers or manufacturers to supply ingredients or produce our products could adversely affect our business operations. We believe we have dependable suppliers for all of our ingredients and that we have identified alternative sources for all of our ingredients except Arabinogalactan, which is an important component used in the formulation of Ambrotose® complex. Although we maintain good relationships with our suppliers and could produce or replace certain of our ingredients if our suppliers are unable to perform, any delay in replacing or substituting such ingredients could affect our business. 10. Inability of new products to gain associate, member, and market acceptance could harm our business. A critical component of our business is our ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among our independent associates and members. If we are unable to introduce new products planned for introduction, our associate productivity could be harmed. In addition, if any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems, this would harm our results of operations. Factors that could affect our ability to continue to introduce new products include, among others, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products, and the difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. 11. Our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm our independent associate and member relationships and product sales and harm our financial condition and operating results. Our business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Therefore, our continued success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes, and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes. The nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions and enhancements. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products, which in turn could harm our independent associate and member relationships and cause the loss of sales. The success of our new product offerings and enhancements depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:  accurately anticipate consumer needs;  innovate and develop new products or product enhancements that meet these needs; 26 Table of Contents  successfully commercialize new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;  price our products competitively;  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and  differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors. If we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our members in a timely manner, some of our products could be rendered obsolete, which could negatively impact our revenues, financial condition and operating results. 12. The global nutrition industry is intensely competitive and the strengthening of any of our competitors could harm our business. The global nutrition industry is intensely fragmented and competitive. We compete for independent associates with other network-marketing companies outside the global nutrition industry. Many competitors have greater name recognition and financial resources, which may give them a competitive advantage. Our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to marketing, promotional, and pricing campaigns that may influence our continuing and potential independent associates and members to buy products from competitors rather than from us. Such competition could adversely affect our business and current market share. 13. A downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as the health and wellness products that we offer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. We appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of health and wellness products. A downturn in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items such as health and wellness products. Factors that could affect consumers willingness to make such discretionary purchases include general business conditions, levels of employment, interest rates and tax rates, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. In the event of an economic downturn, consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. 14. If our network-marketing activities do not comply with government regulations, our business could suffer. Vast arrays of governmental agencies regulate network-marketing activities. A government agencys determination that our business or our independent associates have significantly violated a law or regulation could adversely affect our business. The laws and regulations regulating network-marketing generally intend to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes. Our business faces constant regulatory scrutiny due to the interpretive and enforcement discretion given to regulators, periodic misconduct by our independent associates, adoption of new laws or regulations, and changes in the interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations. Most recently, the Texas Attorney General filed suit against us, MannaRelief Ministries, Samuel L. Caster, the Fisher Institute, and H. Reginald McDaniel alleging violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Texas Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. We are working with our litigation counsel to vigorously defend this lawsuit, but it is not possible at this time to predict whether we will incur any liability in connection with the lawsuit. In addition, in the past and as a result of the industry in which we operate, we have experienced inquiries regarding specific independent associates. We have complied and fully cooperated with all regulatory agencies in connection with such inquiries and are also required by regulatory authorities to disclose any on-going significant regulatory actions. 27 Table of Contents 15. If government regulations regarding network-marketing change or are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to our business, we may be subject to new enforcement actions and material limitations regarding our overall business model. Network-marketing is always subject to extensive governmental regulations, including foreign, federal, and state regulations. Any detrimental change in legislation and regulations could affect our business. Furthermore, significant penalties could be imposed on us for failure to comply with various statutes or regulations. Violations may result from:  misconduct by us or our independent associates;  ambiguity in statutes;  regulations and related court decisions;  the discretion afforded to regulatory authorities and courts interpreting and enforcing laws; and  new regulations or interpretations of regulations affecting our business. 16. If we violate governmental regulations or fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, our operations could be adversely affected. Our operation is subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints at the federal, state, and local levels in our domestic and foreign markets. These regulations primarily involve the following:  the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale, and storage of our products;  the health and safety of food and dietary supplements;  trade practice laws and network-marketing laws;  our product claims and advertising by our independent associates;  our network-marketing system;  pricing restrictions regarding transactions with our foreign subsidiaries or other related parties and similar regulations that affect our level of foreign taxable income;  the assessment of customs duties;  further taxation of our independent associates, which may obligate us to collect additional taxes and maintain additional records; and  export and import restrictions. Any unexpected new regulations or changes in existing regulations could significantly restrict our ability to continue operations, which could adversely affect our business. For example, changes regarding health and safety, and food and drug regulations for our nutritional products could require us to reformulate our products to comply with such regulations. In some foreign countries, nutritional products are considered foods, while other countries consider them drugs. Future health and safety, or food and drug, regulations could delay or prevent our introduction of new products or suspend or prohibit the sale of existing products in a given country or marketplace. In addition, if we expand into other foreign markets, our operations or products could also be affected by the general stability of foreign governments and the regulatory environment relating to network-marketing and our products. If our products are subject to high customs duties, our sales and competitive position could suffer as compared to locally produced goods. Furthermore, import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions could limit our ability to import products from the United States. 28 Table of Contents 17. Increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements as well as new regulations that are being adopted in some of our markets with respect to nutritional supplements could result in more restrictive and burdensome regulations and harm our results if our supplements or advertising activities are found to violate existing or new regulations or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations. There has been an increasing movement in the United States and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements, which could impose additional restrictions or requirements in the future. In several of our markets, new regulations have been adopted or are likely to be adopted in the near-term that could impose new requirements, make changes in some classifications of supplements under the regulations, or limit the claims we can make. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements and marketing claims under existing and new regulations. In Europe for example, we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that have not been previously marketed in Europe (novel foods) without going through an extensive registration and approval process. Europe is also expected to adopt additional regulations this fall setting new limits on acceptable levels of nutrients. In addition, the FDA recently finalized new GMPs for the nutritional supplement industry. Our operations could be harmed if new regulations require us to reformulate products or effect new registrations, if regulatory authorities make determinations that any of our products do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations. In addition, our operations could be harmed if governmental laws or regulations are enacted that restrict the ability of companies to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies. 18. If our international markets are not successful, our business could suffer. We currently sell our products in the international markets of Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Denmark, and Germany. Nonetheless, our international operations could experience changes in legal and regulatory requirements, as well as difficulties in adapting to new foreign cultures and business customs. If we do not adequately address such issues, our international markets may not meet growth expectations. Our international operations and future expansion plans are subject to political, economic, and social uncertainties, including:  inflation;  the renegotiation or modification of various agreements;  increases in custom duties and tariffs;  changes and limits in export controls;  government regulations and laws;  trademark availability and registration issues;  changes in exchange rates;  changes in taxation;  wars and other hostilities; and  changes in the perception of network-marketing. Any negative changes related to these factors could adversely affect our business, profitability, and growth prospects. Furthermore, any negative changes in our distribution channels may force us to invest significant time and money related to our distribution and sales to maintain our position in certain international markets. 29 Table of Contents 19. If our information technology system fails, our operations could suffer. Like many companies, our business is heavily dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions, including:  order processing;  customer service;  product distribution;  commission processing;  cash receipts and payments; and  financial reporting. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires, earthquakes, telecommunications failures and other events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Although we maintain an extensive security system and disaster recovery program that was developed under the guidelines published by the National Institute of Standards of Technology, a long-term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business. 20. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits. In 2007 and 2006, we recognized 40.8% and 33.8%, respectively, of our net sales in markets outside of the United States. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the United States dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the United States dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations. However, to help mitigate this risk, our management monitors applicable exchange rates. To date we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities. 21. We may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent associates, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Our independent associates are subject to taxation and, in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate records. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors. In the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or that our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 22. Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases. Decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock. The price of our common stock and the price at which we could sell securities in the future could significantly fluctuate in response to:  broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions;  fluctuations in our financial results; 30 Table of Contents  future securities offerings;  changes in the markets perception of our products or our business, including false or negative publicity;  governmental regulatory actions;  the outcome of any lawsuits;  financial and business announcements made by us or our competitors; and  the general condition of the industry. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock in the open market could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us or that are outside of our control. 23. Certain shareholders, directors, and officers own a significant amount of our stock, which could allow them to influence corporate transactions and other matters. As of December 31, 2007, our directors and executive officers, collectively with their families and affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 40.8% of our total outstanding common stock. As a result, if any of these shareholders choose to act together based on their current share ownership, they may be able to control a significant percentage of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, which could affect the outcome of a shareholder vote on the election of directors, the adoption of stock option plans, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. 24. We have implemented anti-takeover provisions that may help discourage a change of control. Certain provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the Texas Business Corporation Act help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our company, even if the proposal may benefit our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to determine the price and terms of any preferred stock. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholders approval could deter or delay unsolicited changes of control by discouraging open market purchases of our common stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock. Discouraging open market purchases may be disadvantageous to our shareholders who may otherwise desire to participate in a transaction in which they would receive a premium for their shares. In addition, other provisions may also discourage a change of control by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, proxy contest or otherwise. Our charter documents provide for three classes of directors on our Board of Directors with members of each class serving staggered three year terms. Also, the Texas Business Corporation Act restricts, subject to exceptions, business combinations with any affiliated shareholder. Any or all of these provisions could delay, deter or help prevent a takeover of our Company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock. 25. We are not required to pay dividends, and our board of directors could decide not to declare a dividend or could reduce the amount of the dividend at any time. While we have historically paid dividends since 2004, the declaration of dividends on our common stock is solely within the discretion of our board of directors, subject to limitations under Texas law stipulating that dividends may not be paid if payment therefore would cause the corporation to be insolvent or if the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation. Our board of directors could at any time decide not to declare a dividend, or could reduce the level of our dividend payments, or we could be prevented from declaring a dividend because of legal or contractual restrictions. The failure to pay a dividend could reduce our stock price. 31 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
