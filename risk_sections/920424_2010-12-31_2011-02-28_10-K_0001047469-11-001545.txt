Item 1A. Risk Factors Certain Factors That May Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations While our management's long term expectations are optimistic, we face risks or uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. The following conditions, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook. Decreases in equity trading volumes by actively managed funds or securities prices could harm our business and profitability. Declines in the volume of equity securities traded by actively managed funds would generally result in lower revenues from our trading solutions, which generate the vast majority of our revenues globally. In addition, securities' price declines would adversely affect our non-North American trading commissions, which are based on the value of transactions. The demand for our trading solutions is directly affected by factors such as economic, regulatory and political conditions that may lead to decreased trading activity and prices in the securities markets in the U.S. and in all of the foreign markets we serve. Over the past several years, trading volumes and market values have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so. Increased risk aversion brought about by the financial crisis of 2008, concerns over sovereign debt levels and the U.S. "flash crash" in May 2010 resulted in a significant flow of funds out of actively managed domestic equity funds, thereby curtailing their trading activity, which has weighed heavily on our average daily volumes and the use of our higher value services. The expected correlation between recovering share prices and the flow of money back into equity funds has not yet materialized. 9 Table of Contents Decreases in our commission rates and other transactional revenues could adversely affect our operating results. For the last several years, the institutional equities markets have experienced continued pricing pressure on commission rates, and we experienced a significant decrease in our average commission rate in recent years. We anticipate a continuation of the competitive commission pricing environment for the foreseeable future due to the proliferation of electronic execution firms and the bundling of commissions and other services. In addition, reduced activity from our actively managed fund manager clients has resulted in a shift in the mix of our business to include an increased portion from high turnover low rate clients. The amount of revenue capture we derive from clients who trade with us on a net basis can also be negatively impacted by extended periods of low market volatility. A significant decrease in commission rates or revenue capture could materially reduce our margins and harm our financial condition and operating results. Our fixed costs may result in reduced profitability or losses. We incur significant operating and capital expenditures to support our business that do not vary directly, at least in the short term, with fluctuations in executed transaction volumes and revenues. In addition, changes in market practices have required us, and may require us in the future, to invest in additional infrastructure to increase capacity levels without a corresponding increase in revenues. To ensure that we have the capacity to process projected increases in transaction volumes, we have historically made substantial capital, operating and research expenditures in advance of such projected increases, including during periods of low revenues. In the event of a material reduction in trade executions and/or revenues, we may not be able to reduce such expenses quickly and, as a result, we could experience reduced profitability or losses. In the event that growth in executed volumes does not occur or we are not able to successfully implement and monetize our capital and research projects, including by failing to accurately forecast the demand for new products, the expenses related to such investments could cause reduced profitability or losses. A further reduction in our profitability or in our share price may require us to record additional impairment charges related to goodwill and such charges may be large and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2010, we had goodwill of $468.5 million on our consolidated balance sheet, representing 54% of our stockholders' equity. Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. During 2010, indicators of potential impairment prompted us to perform goodwill impairment tests at the end of each quarterly interim period. These indicators included a prolonged decrease in our market capitalization, a decline in our recent operating results in comparison to prior years, and the significant near-term uncertainty related to both the global economic recovery and the outlook for our industry. As part of our June 30, 2010 interim test, we determined that $5.4 million of goodwill related to our Australian operations was impaired. If there is a further reduction in our profitability or in our share price, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on goodwill. Since goodwill comprises a substantial portion of our balance sheet, such charges could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 10 Table of Contents A failure in the design, operation or configuration of our technology could adversely affect our profitability and reputation. A technological failure or error of one or more of our products or systems, including but not limited to POSIT Marketplace, our algorithms, smart routers, and order and execution management systems, could result in lost revenues and/or significant market losses. We operate complex trading systems, analytical products and algorithms that may fail to correctly model interacting or conflicting trading objectives, unusual market conditions, available trading venues and other factors, which may cause unintended results. Similarly, the operation and configuration of our systems can be quite complex and departure from standard procedures can result in adverse trading outcomes. Such problems could cause us to incur trading losses, lose clients or experience other reputational harm resulting in lost revenues and profits. While we put our products through rigorous quality assurance testing and certifications, we cannot test for all potential scenarios or ensure that the technology will function as designed and intended in all cases. If we fail to keep up with rapid changes in technology and continue to provide leading products and services to our customers, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. The institutional brokerage industry is subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Our customers' demands become greater and more sophisticated as the dissemination of products and information to customers increases. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services, products and technologies, innovate in a timely and cost-effective manner and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards, we may be unable to compete effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do to fund such technological advances. Moreover, the development of technology-based services is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases, failure to meet key deadlines or significant problems in creating new products could negatively impact our revenues and profits. Insufficient system capacity, system operating failures, disasters or security breaches could materially harm our reputation, financial position and profitability. Our business relies heavily on the computer and communications systems supporting our operations, which must monitor, process and support a large volume of transactions across numerous execution venues in many countries and multiple currencies. As our business expands, we will need to expand our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions across a larger client base and more geographical locations. In addition, certain changes in market practices may require us to invest in infrastructure to increase capacity levels. Unexpectedly high volumes or times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly, decrease output or even fail for periods of time, as could general power or telecommunications failures, natural disasters or other business disruptions. The presence of computer viruses can also cause failure within our systems. If any of our systems do not operate properly, are disabled or breached, we could incur financial loss, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. System failure, degradation or breach could adversely affect our ability to effectuate transactions and lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations, initiate regulatory inquiries or proceedings, file lawsuits against us, trade less frequently through us or cease doing business with us. Our corporate headquarters and largest concentration of employees and technology is in the New York metropolitan area. Our other offices are also located in major cities around the globe. If a business system disruption were to occur, especially in New York, for any reason including widespread health emergencies, natural disasters or terrorist activities, and we were unable to execute our disaster 11 Table of Contents recovery plan, it could have a material effect on our business. Moreover, we have varying levels of disaster recovery plan coverage among our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our business relies on the secure storage, processing and transmission of data, including our clients' confidential data, in our internal systems and through our vendor networks and communications infrastructure. Third parties who are able to breach our or our vendors' security systems may be able to cause system damage or failures or perform unauthorized trading that could result in significant losses. Although we take significant precautions and implement protective measures, which are updated and monitored regularly, there is no guarantee that our systems can prevent all unauthorized access or that our third party vendors will be able to secure their networks and systems. If our or one of our vendors' security is breached and unauthorized access is obtained to the confidential information of our clients, it could cause us reputational harm and our clients may then reduce or cease their use of our services, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Any system, operational or security failure or breach could result in regulatory or legal claims. We could incur significant costs in defending such regulatory or legal claims, even those without merit. Moreover, such failures could result in the need to remediate issues and repair or expand our networks and systems. Any obligation to expend significant resources to defend claims or repair and expand infrastructure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on certain third party vendors for key services. We depend on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading systems, computers, market and research data, data centers, FIX connectivity, communication network infrastructure, other equipment and related support and maintenance. We cannot be certain that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient and cost-effective manner or that they will be willing or able to meet our evolving needs. Moreover, we are dependent on our communications network providers for interconnectivity with our clients, markets and clearing agents to service our customers and operate effectively. If our vendors fail to meet their obligations, provide poor, inaccurate or untimely service, or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of these services, we may fail, in turn, to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business, financial condition and our operating results could be materially harmed. Our securities and clearing business exposes us to material liquidity risk. We are self-clearing in the U.S., Hong Kong and Australia. In those markets, we may be required to provide considerable additional capital to regulatory agencies or increase margin deposits with clearing and settlement organizations, such as the National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC") or Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ("DTCC") in the U.S., especially during periods of high market volatility. In addition, regulatory agencies may require these clearing and settlement organizations to increase the level of margin deposit requirements. We rely on our excess cash and certain established credit facilities to meet those demands. While we have historically met requests for additional margin deposits, there is no guarantee that our excess cash and our established credit facilities will be sufficient for future needs, particularly if there is an increase in requirements. There is also no guarantee that these established credit facilities will be extended beyond their expiration. In addition, each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries worldwide is subject to regulatory capital requirements promulgated by the applicable regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. The failure by any of these subsidiaries to maintain its required regulatory capital may lead to suspension or revocation of its broker-dealer registration and its suspension or expulsion by its regulatory body. Historically, all regulatory capital needs of our broker-dealers have been provided by cash from operations. However, if cash from operations, together with existing financing facilities are not sufficient, we cannot be assured that we would be able to obtain additional financing. 12 Table of Contents Our business exposes us to credit risk that could affect our operating results and profitability. We are exposed to credit risk from third parties that owe us money, securities or other obligations, including our customers and trading counterparties. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons, and we could be held responsible for such defaults. In addition, client trading errors for which they are unable to cover may cause us to incur financial losses. Volatile securities markets, credit markets and regulatory changes may increase our exposure to our customers' credit profiles, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. While our broker-dealer subsidiaries that are not self-clearing have clearing agreements with their clearing brokers who review the credit risk of trading counterparties, we have no assurances that those reviews or our own are adequate to provide sufficient protection from this risk. We may incur material losses on foreign exchange transactions entered into on behalf of clients and be exposed to material liquidity risk due to counterparty defaults or errors. We enable clients to settle cross-border equity transactions in their local currency through the use of foreign exchange contracts. These arrangements typically involve the delivery of securities or cash to a counterparty that is not processed through a central clearing facility in exchange for a simultaneous receipt of cash or securities. ITG may operate as either a principal or agent in these transactions. As a result, a default by one of our counterparties prior to the settlement of their obligation could materially impact our liquidity and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to operational risk. Employee and technological errors in executing, recording or reporting foreign exchange transactions may result in material losses due to the large size of such transactions and the underlying market risk in correcting such errors. As a clearing member firm in certain jurisdictions we are subject to significant default risk. We are required to finance our clients' unsettled positions from time to time and we could be held responsible for the defaults of our clients. Default by our clients may also give rise to our incurring penalties imposed by execution venues, regulatory authorities and settlement systems. Although we regularly review our credit exposure, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that may be difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions that could in turn adversely affect us. Our operations in jurisdictions other than the U.S., Hong Kong and Australia are dependent on their clearing agents and any failures by such clearing agents could materially impact our business and operating results. Certain of our international operations are dependent on agents for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. If our agents fail to properly facilitate the clearance and settlement of our customer trades, we could be subject to financial, legal and regulatory risks and costs that may impact our business and operating results. In addition, it could cause our clients to reduce or cease their trading with us, which would adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Moreover, certain of our agreements with clearing agents may be terminated upon short notice. There is no guarantee that we could obtain alternative services in a timely manner and any interruption of the normal course of our trading and clearing operations could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. 13 Table of Contents We may incur losses as a result of principal trading activities. A portion of our revenues is derived from principal trading for our own account where we incur risk. All such principal trading activity is conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, including those pertaining to the maintenance of information barriers. While the revenues from this trading activity are currently not material to our consolidated revenues and profits, changes in our business as well as in market practices may result in this activity increasing over time. Although we attempt to close out all of our positions by the end of the day, we may incur losses due to market fluctuations, with such losses having a disproportionate effect on our results. The business in which we operate is extremely competitive worldwide. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which, among other things, enable them to compete with the services we provide on the basis of price, including lowering prices for certain of our key services to gain business in their higher margin areas, and a willingness to commit their firms' capital to service their clients' trading needs on a principal, rather than on an agency basis. Many of them offer a wider range of services, have broader name recognition, and have larger customer bases than we do. Some of our competitors have long-standing, well-established relationships with their clients, and also hold dominant positions in their trading markets. Moreover, new entrants may enter the market with alternative methods of providing trade execution and related services, and existing competitors often launch new initiatives. Most recently, many of our competitors have undertaken measures to link various electronic trading systems and platforms in an effort to attract order flow to off-exchange venues and increase internal executions. Although we believe that our products and services have established certain competitive advantages, our ability to maintain these advantages will require continued enhancements to our products, investment in the development of our services, additional marketing activities and enhanced customer support services. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make this investment, that our competitors will not devote significantly more resources to competing services or that we will otherwise be successful in maintaining our market position. If competitors offer superior services, our market share would be affected and this would adversely impact our business and results of operations. We face certain challenges and risks to our international business that may adversely affect our strategy. Global client coverage is a key component of our business plan. We have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the globalization of our products and services. However, there are certain risks inherent in the operation of our business outside of the U.S., including but not limited to, additional regulatory capital requirements, less developed technology and infrastructure and higher costs for infrastructure. These risks may limit our ability to provide services to clients in certain markets. There also may be difficult processes for obtaining regulatory approvals. This could result in delays in our global business plans, difficulties in staffing foreign operations and adapting our products to foreign markets, practices and languages, exchange rate risks and the need to meet foreign regulatory requirements. Each of these could force us to alter our operational plans and this may adversely impact our strategy. We incur risks related to our international business due to currency exchange rate fluctuations that could impact our financial results and financial position. A significant amount of our business is conducted in foreign currencies. Conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar subjects us to exchange rate fluctuations. These fluctuations can materially impact our financial results. 14 Table of Contents We are dependent on certain major customers and a decline in their use of our services could materially impact our revenues. Our customers may discontinue their use of our trading services at any time. The loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The chart below sets forth our dependence on our three largest clients individually, as well as on our ten largest clients in the aggregate, expressed as a percentage of total revenues: % of Total Consolidated Revenue 2010 2009 2008 Largest customer 2.8 % 2.6 % 4.2 % Second largest customer 2.0 % 2.1 % 2.2 % Third largest customer 1.7 % 2.0 % 2.1 % Ten largest customers 15.8 % 16.3 % 19.2 % The securities markets and the brokerage industry in which we operate globally are subject to extensive, evolving regulation that could materially impact our business. We currently operate the POSIT suite in the U.S. under Regulation ATS, our European operations are subject to MiFID and we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Patriot Act and its foreign equivalents for monitoring our customers and suspicious transactions. Moreover, most aspects of our broker-dealer operations are highly regulated, such as sales and reporting practices, operational compliance, capital requirements and licensure of employees. Accordingly, we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business, such as the SEC and FINRA in the U.S. and their equivalents in other countries. As we expand our business, we may be exposed to increased and different types of regulatory requirements and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. In the future, we may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which may adversely affect our business. Also, regulatory changes that impact how our customers conduct their business may impact our business and results of operations. The current U.S. administration and other members of the U.S. federal government and other governments outside of the United States have indicated that they are considering new regulatory requirements for the financial services industry. We cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes can affect our business. In 2010, the SEC approved several rule amendments, including but not limited to, the short sale price test rule and the market access rule. In 2009, the SEC proposed additional regulatory obligations for operators of dark liquidity pools, which may have a material impact on our business model if approved by the SEC. In addition, new regulatory obligations have been proposed pertaining to markets outside of the United States which may have a material impact upon our business model, including proposed changes to MiFID (MiFID II). Last, the recent report by the Joint CFTC-SEC Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues included, among other things, a recommendation that U.S. regulators implement a version of a "trade-at" rule requiring that any non-exchange trade improve the market price by half a penny. If implemented as recommended, such "trade-at" rule could have a negative impact on our revenues generated from net executions. If we are unable to obtain unique sources of data to create our differentiated research product we could see a reduction in revenues and profitability. Our investment research product leverages data derived from, among other sources, industry data providers and Web harvesting technology. If there is a limitation on the availability of data from these sources or if new regulations or laws restrict their use in investment research products, the quality of 15 Table of Contents our research product could be negatively impacted along with the amount of revenue and profitability we derive from this offering. We could be subject to challenges by U.S. and foreign tax authorities that could result in additional taxes and penalties. We are subject to income and other taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We are also subject to reviews and audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Our determination of our tax obligations in each jurisdiction requires us and our advisers to make judgment calls and estimations. Our determination may differ, even materially, from the judgment of the tax authorities and therefore cause us to incur additional taxes and related interest and penalties, which could impact our financial results. Inability to protect our intellectual property may result in increased competition, loss of business or other negative results on our business and financial condition. Our success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary intellectual property. We generally rely upon patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technology, methods, products and services. We cannot assure that any of the rights granted under any patent, copyright or trademark that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages. A third party may still try to challenge, invalidate or circumvent the protective mechanisms that we select. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., so we cannot predict our ability to properly protect our intellectual property in those jurisdictions. Third parties operating in jurisdictions in which we have not filed for protection may obtain rights in intellectual property that we have protected in the U.S. and other jurisdictions or may be able to misappropriate our intellectual property with impunity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property from improper disclosure or use, or that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology without violating our intellectual property. Violations of our intellectual property by third parties could have an adverse effect on our competitiveness and business. In addition, the cost of seeking to enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial results. If we were to unknowingly infringe third party intellectual property or be accused of doing so without merit, we would bear significant costs of defense and litigation, which could impact our financial results. In the past several years, there has been a proliferation of patents applicable to the computer and financial services industries. Under current law, U.S. patent applications remain secret for 18 months and may, depending on how they are prosecuted, remain secret until the issuance of a patent. In light of these factors, it is not always possible to determine in advance whether any of our products or services may infringe the present or future patent rights of others. From time to time, we may receive notices from others of claims or potential claims of intellectual property infringement or we may be called upon to defend our product, customer, vendee or licensee against such third party claims. Responding to these kinds of claims, regardless of merit, could consume valuable time and result in costly litigation that could have a material adverse effect on us. Such claims could also result in our entering into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement on terms that could have a material impact on our profitability. 16 Table of Contents Financial and operational problems with our acquisitions and strategic relationships could have a material impact on our results of operation. Over the last several years, we have undertaken several strategic acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Macgregor, RedSky Financial, LLC (now ITG Derivatives) and Majestic Research Corp. (now ITG Investment Research), as well as various strategic relationships. We intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and strategic relationships. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including but not limited to difficulties in valuing the acquired businesses, combining personnel and firm cultures, integrating acquired products, services and operations, achieving anticipated synergies that were inherent in our valuation assumptions, the assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies and the potential loss of key clients or employees of acquired companies. We may also have clients, with whom we have established trading relationships that seek to utilize the products and services of acquired companies without increasing the amount of revenue they pay us. Strategic relationships may be important to our business prospects and we may not be able to successfully develop or maintain such relationships. If we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate the acquired businesses, if we suffer a material loss due to an acquired business or if we fail to develop or maintain strategic relationships, it may have a material effect on our operating results. Our business could be adversely affected by our inability to attract and retain talented employees, including sales, technology and development professionals. Our business operations require highly specialized knowledge of the financial industry and of technological innovation as it applies to the financial industry. If we are unable to hire or retain the services of talented management, sales, research, technology and development professionals, we would be at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, recruitment and retention of qualified staff could result in substantial additional costs. Misconduct and errors of our employees could cause us reputational and financial harm. Employee errors in recording or executing transactions for customers can cause us to enter into transactions that customers may disavow and refuse to settle. These transactions expose us to risk of loss, which can be material, until we detect the errors in question and unwind or reverse the transactions. As with any unsettled transaction, adverse movements in the prices of the securities involved in these transactions before we unwind or reverse them can increase this risk. We may incur losses as a result of these transactions that could materially impact our financial results. In addition to trading errors, other employee errors or misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. Such misconduct could result in losses, litigation or other material adverse effects on the Company. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective and may leave us exposed to unidentified or unexpected risks. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, technological, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our policies, procedures and practices used to identify, monitor and control a variety of risks may fail to be effective. As a result, we face the risk of losses, including, for example, losses resulting from trading errors, customer defaults, fraud and money-laundering. Our risk management 17 Table of Contents methods rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and failure. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As such, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Item 1B.
