Item 1A: Risk Factors Industry cyclicality can affect our earnings, especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken. Profitability in the chicken industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of chicken and feed ingredients, which are determined by supply and demand factors, which result in cyclical earnings fluctuations. The production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world, the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients, and the agricultural policies of the United States and foreign governments. In particular, weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner. A sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients, as well as both the industryÂ’s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients, grow chickens and deliver products. High feed ingredient p rices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past. We periodically seek, to the extent available, to enter into advance purchase commitments for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs. The use of such instruments may not be successful. Leverage. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. We presently have, and expect to continue to have, an amount of indebtedness. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders. For example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, and failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness. Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is dependent on various factors. These factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Additional Borrowings Available. Despite our indebtedness, we are not prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness in the future. Contamination of Products. If our products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls. This could affect our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products. Livestock and Poultry Disease (including Avian Influenza). Outbreaks of livestock diseases in general and poultry disease in particular, can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products. We take extensive precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner. However, events beyond our control, such as the outbreak of disease, could significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations. Furthermore, an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken, to or from our suppliers, facilities or customers, or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks. This could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products success fully and on our business, reputation and prospects. 4 In recent months there has been substantial publicity regarding a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza known as H5N1, which has been affecting Asia since 2002 and which has recently been found in Eastern Europe. It is widely believed that H5N1 is being spread by migratory birds such as ducks and geese. There have also been some cases where H5N1 is believed to have passed from birds to humans as humans came into contact with live birds that were infected with the disease. H5N1 has not been identified in North America. With a potential spread to North America of the H5N1 strain, there can be no assurance that it will not materially adversely affect the demand for North American poultry both in domestic and international markets. There is also no assurance that it would not significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products. Insurance. We are exposed to risks relating to product liability, product recall, property damage and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive, limited and potentially inadequate. Our business operations entail a number of risks including risks relating to product liability claims, product recalls, property damage and injuries to persons. We currently maintain insurance coverage of certain of these risks, but no assurances can be given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses attributable to certain events, or at all. Additionally, even though coverage may be designed to protect us from losses from certain events, it may not adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur related to such events. Significant Competition. Competition in the chicken industry with other vertically integrated poultry companies and other protein sources could adversely affect our business. Government Regulation. Regulation, present and future, is a constant factor affecting our business. The chicken industry is subject to federal, state and local governmental regulation, including health and environmental areas. We anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety, the use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of poultry by-products and wastewater discharges. Unknown matters, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future.
