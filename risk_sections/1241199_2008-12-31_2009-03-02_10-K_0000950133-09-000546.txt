Risk Factors, on page 31.  With limited exceptions, the law prohibits payment of amounts owed to healthcare providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to be directed to any entity other than actual providers approved for participation in the applicable programs. Accordingly, while we lend money that is secured by pledges of Medicare and Medicaid receivables, if we were required to invoke our rights to the pledged receivables, we would be unable to collect receivables payable under these programs directly. We would need a court order to force collection directly against these governmental payers.  Hospitals, nursing facilities and other providers of healthcare services are not always assured of receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement adequate to cover the actual costs of operating the facilities. Many states are presently considering enacting, or have already enacted, reductions in the amount of funds appropriated to healthcare programs resulting in rate freezes or reductions to their Medicaid payment rates and often curtailments of coverage afforded to Medicaid enrollees. Most of our healthcare clients depend on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and reductions in reimbursements caused by either payment cuts 19 or census declines from these programs may have a negative impact on their ability to generate adequate revenues to satisfy their obligations to us. There are no assurances that payments from governmental payors will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will, in the future, be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for coverage under these programs.  For our clients to remain eligible to receive reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid programs the clients must comply with a number of conditions of participation and other regulations imposed by these programs, and are subject to periodic federal and state surveys to ensure compliance with various clinical and operational covenants. A clients failure to comply with these covenants and regulations may cause the client to incur penalties and fines and other sanctions, or lose its eligibility to continue to receive reimbursements under the programs, which could result in the clients inability to make scheduled payments to us.

Statistical Disclosures The following supplemental statistical disclosures are presented as a result of our acquisition of 22 retail banking branches from Fremont Investment & Loan and the commencement of CapitalSource Banks operations on July 25, 2008 (commencement date). This information is prepared in accordance with Industry Guide 3 and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 11-K. The financial data for the year ended December 31, 2008 comprised information from CapitalSource Inc. for the entire year and CapitalSource Bank for the period from the commencement date through December 31, 2008. Financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004 do not include any information from CapitalSource Bank. For purposes of the following statistical disclosures, we determined separate disclosure of foreign data was unnecessary because they are not material in relation to the domestic activities of our operations for all years presented in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, certain amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified from previous years presentations to conform to the current year presentation. Table 1. Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders Equity The following table summarizes our consolidated average balances, including the related interest earned from interest-earning assets, interest expensed on interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting average interest yields and rates for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the average balances were calculated using daily amounts throughout the entire year, even though CapitalSource Bank commenced operations on July 25, 2008. This allows for the average yields (rates) to be presented on an annual basis. 21 December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Interest Avg Interest Avg Interest Avg Average Income / Yield / Average Income / Yield / Average Income / Yield / Balance (Expense) Rate Balance (Expense Rate Balance (Expense) Rate ($ in thousands) Interest-earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,346,552 $ 23,738 1.76 % $ 560,440 $ 21,181 3.78 % $ 492,768 $ 18,073 3.67 % Marketable securities, available-for-sale(3) 199,813 7,395 3.71 %   N/A   N/A Mortgage related receivables, net 1,921,538 94,485 4.92 % 2,166,728 127,330 5.88 % 2,022,035 115,546 5.71 % Mortgage-backed securities pledged, trading 2,190,775 122,181 5.58 % 3,815,471 212,869 5.58 % 2,678,471 147,308 5.50 % Commercial real estate A Participation Interest, net 700,973 54,226 7.74 %   N/A   N/A Loans(1)(2) 9,604,619 931,028 9.69 % 8,959,621 1,074,598 11.99 % 6,932,389 902,669 13.02 % Investments(3) 43,090 8,526 16.04 % 44,038 4,293 9.75 % 44,217 3,360 7.59 % Other assets 8,651 128 1.48 % 644 27 4.19 % 641 62 9.67 % Total interest-earning assets 16,016,011 $ 1,241,707 7.75 % 15,546,942 $ 1,440,298 9.26 % 12,170,521 $ 1,187,018 9.75 % Non interest-earning assets 1,589,583 1,266,872 424,247 Total assets $ 17,605,594 $ 16,813,814 $ 12,594,768 Interest-bearing liabilities: Deposits $ 2,207,210 $ 76,245 3.45 % $  $  N/A $  $  N/A Repurchase agreements 2,374,890 85,458 3.60 % 3,771,977 198,610 5.27 % 2,737,289 138,460 5.06 % Credit facilities 1,781,486 125,197 7.03 % 2,808,230 188,543 6.71 % 2,901,227 183,203 6.31 % Term debt 6,240,744 300,723 4.82 % 6,003,040 369,476 6.15 % 3,947,727 240,242 6.09 % Other borrowings 1,639,229 124,489 7.59 % 1,522,108 90,612 5.95 % 893,204 44,820 5.02 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 14,243,559 $ 712,112 5.00 % 14,105,355 $ 847,241 6.01 % 10,479,447 $ 606,725 5.79 % Non interest-bearing liabilities 409,518 280,292 153,475 Total liabilities 14,653,077 14,385,647 10,632,922 Noncontrolling interests 19,818 47,544 52,437 Shareholders equity 2,932,699 2,380,623 1,909,409 Total liabilities, noncontrolling interests and shareholders equity $ 17,605,594 $ 16,813,814 $ 12,594,768 (1) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest income from outstanding loans included loan fees of $133.1 million, $162.4 million and $170.5 million, respectively. (2) The average principal amounts of non-accrual loans have been included in the average loan balances to determine the average yield earned on loans. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the average principal balances of non-accrual loans were $231.7 million, $162.1 million and $156.4 million, respectively. (3) The average yields for investment securities available-for-sale were calculated based on the amortized costs of the individual securities and do not reflect any changes in fair value, which were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our audited consolidated balance sheets. The average yields for investment securities held-to-maturity have also been calculated using amortized cost balances. 22 The following table presents the average total interest-earning assets, net interest-earnings and net yield on interest-earning assets for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 ($ in thousands) Average total interest-earning assets $ 16,016,011 $ 15,546,942 $ 12,170,521 Net interest-earnings(1) $ 529,595 $ 593,057 $ 580,293 Net yield on interest-earning assets(2) 3.31 % 3.81 % 4.77 % (1) Net interest-earnings is defined as the difference between total interest income and total interest expense. (2) Net yield on interest-earning assets is defined as net interest earnings divided by average total interest-earning assets. Table 2. Interest Income/Expense Variance Analysis The following table presents the changes in interest income, interest expense and net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of changes in volume, changes in interest rates or both. Volume and interest rate variances have been calculated based on movements in average balances over the period and changes in interest rates on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Changes due to a combination of volume and interest rates were allocated proportionally to the absolute change in volume and interest rates. 2008 Compared to 2007 2007 Compared to 2006 (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Increase Due to Changes in: Net Due to Changes in: Net Rate Volume Change Rate Volume Change ($ in thousands) Interest income: Cash and cash equivalents $ (15,671 ) $ 18,228 $ 2,557 $ 565 $ 2,543 $ 3,108 Marketable securities, available-for-sale N/A 7,395 7,395 N/A   Mortgage related receivables, net (19,399 ) (13,446 ) (32,845 ) 3,348 8,436 11,784 Mortgage-backed securities pledged, trading (77 ) (90,611 ) (90,688 ) 2,157 63,404 65,561 Commercial real estate A Participation Interest, net N/A 54,226 54,226 N/A   Loans (216,880 ) 73,310 (143,570 ) (75,638 ) 247,567 171,929 Investments 4,327 (94 ) 4,233 946 (13 ) 933 Other assets (27 ) 128 101 (37 ) 2 (35 ) Total (decrease) increase in interest income (247,727 ) 49,136 (198,591 ) (68,659 ) 321,939 253,280 Interest expense: Deposits N/A 76,245 76,245 N/A   Repurchase agreements (52,145 ) (61,007 ) (113,152 ) 5,879 54,271 60,150 Credit facilities 8,445 (71,791 ) (63,346 ) 11,337 (5,997 ) 5,340 Term debt (82,893 ) 14,140 (68,753 ) 2,764 126,470 129,234 Other borrowings 26,483 7,394 33,877 9,585 36,207 45,792 Total (decrease) increase in interest expense (100,110 ) (35,019 ) (135,129 ) 29,565 210,951 240,516 Net (decrease) increase in net interest income $ (147,617 ) $ 84,155 $ (63,462 ) $ (98,224 ) $ 110,988 $ 12,764 23 Certain selected ratios associated with our financial information are included in Item 6, Selected Financial Data.

The remaining amounts are presented in marketable securities, available-for-sale in our audited consolidated balance sheets. (3) Such amounts are included in investments in our audited consolidated balance sheets and further discussed in Note 8, Marketable Securities and Investments, within our audited consolidated financial statements. We did not hold any securities held-to-maturity as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2008, we held $597.6 million and $1.1 billion of securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, respectively. 24 Table 4. Investments by Maturity Dates The following table presents the carrying amounts, contractual maturities and weighted average yields of our debt securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2008. Actual maturities of these securities may differ from contractual maturity dates because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. The weighted average yields were calculated based on the amortized costs of the individual securities and do not reflect any changes in fair value, which were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our audited consolidated balance sheets.

The weighted average yield was calculated based on the amortized costs of the individual securities. The debt trading securities were not included in this table because these securities are expected to be traded within one year. Table 5. Loan Balances by Product Type The following table presents an analysis of our commercial loan portfolio reflecting the sectors in which our borrowers operated. The loan amounts, which exclude allowances for loan losses and are net of unearned income, were as of December 31 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004. December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Commercial(1) $ 6,153,773 $ 6,237,073 $ 4,912,664 $ 3,796,912 $ 2,903,467 Real estate 2,109,233 2,212,406 2,384,210 1,936,402 1,137,112 Real estate  construction 959,428 1,120,578 360,898 91,486 98,843 Total loans $ 9,222,434 $ 9,570,057 $ 7,657,772 $ 5,824,800 $ 4,139,422 (1) For purpose of this table, commercial loans are either asset-based loans or cash flow loans and exclude loans secured by real estate. Asset-based loans are collateralized by specified assets of the client, generally the clients accounts receivable and/or inventory. Cash flow loans are made based on our assessment of a clients ability to generate cash flows sufficient to repay the loan and to maintain or increase its enterprise value during the term of the loan. 25 Although our loan portfolio included borrowers from more than 11 industries as of December 31, 2008, we had a high concentration of our loan balances in four industries in particular. The following are the highly-concentrated industries and the respective percentage of loan balances of total loans: Percentage of Industries Total Loans Health care and social assistance 18 % Accommodation and food services 14 % Finance and insurance 12 % Construction 11 % The 1,072 loans within these industries are to 679 borrowers located throughout most of the United States (47 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico). The largest loan was $325.0 million, which was 3.5% of total loans. A discussion of our commercial loan portfolio, including further statistical analysis of the commercial loan portfolio, is in the Overview section of Item 1, Business. Table 6. Loan Balances by Maturities The following table presents an analysis of the contractual maturity of our commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. Due After One Due One Year or Year Through Due After Five Less Five Years Years Total ($ in thousands) Commercial $ 667,735 $ 4,734,792 $ 751,246 $ 6,153,773 Real estate 530,147 1,478,672 100,414 2,109,233 Real estate  construction 684,211 275,217  959,428 Total loans $ 1,882,093 $ 6,488,681 $ 851,660 $ 9,222,434 Table 7. Sensitivity of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates The following table presents the total amount of loans due after one year with predetermined interest rates and floating or adjustable interest rates as of December 31, 2008. Loans with predetermined interest rates are loans for which the interest rate is fixed for the entire term of the loan. All other loans are considered loans with floating or adjustable rates. Loans with Loans with Floating Predetermined or Rates Adjustable Rates Total ($ in thousands) Commercial $ 113,243 $ 5,372,795 $ 5,486,038 Real estate 206,249 1,372,837 1,579,086 Real estate  construction  275,217 275,217 Total loans $ 319,492 $ 7,020,849 $ 7,340,341 Table 8. Non-performing and Potential Problem Loans The following table presents the outstanding balances of our non-performing loans as of December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Non-performing loans are loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis, accruing loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments, and other loans under troubled debt restructurings (as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings). Loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis are loans on which interest income is no longer recognized on an accrual basis and loans for which a specific provision is recorded for the full amount of accrued interest receivable. 26 We place loans on non-accrual status when we expect, based on judgment, that the borrower will not be able to service its debt and other obligations. Troubled debt restructurings are loans that have been restructured as a result of the deterioration in the borrowers financial position and which we have granted a concession to the borrower that we would not have otherwise granted if those conditions did not exist. Certain conditions to the borrowers financial position that could result in the restructuring of the loan are economic or legal conditions. Troubled debt restructurings exclude loans that also meet the criteria of loans on a non-accrual basis and loans contractually past-due 90 days or more.

For the period ended December 31, 2008, interest income amounts earned on such loans that were recorded and included in net income were $32.4 million. 27 The following table presents the outstanding balance of our potential problem loans as of December 31, 2008. Potential problem loans are loans that are not considered non-performing loans, as previously discussed, but loans where management is aware of information regarding potential credit problems of our borrowers that leads to serious doubts as to the ability of compliance with loan covenants or defaults by the borrowers. Such non-compliance or defaults could eventually result in the loans being reclassified as non-performing loans ($ in thousands).

Summary of Loan Loss Experience The following table presents the movements in the loan loss allowance according to the industry sectors of our loan portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004. We establish allowances for loan losses in our loan portfolio that represent managements estimate of probable losses as of the balance sheet date.

RISK FACTORS Our business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our securities could decline even further than it has over the past several months. The U.S. economy is currently in an economic recession and we expect this to have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations, including, without limitation, the credit quality of our loan portfolio, our liquidity and our earnings. You should know that many of the risks described may apply to more than just the subsection in which we grouped them for the purpose of this presentation. As a result, you should consider all of the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our securities. Risks Impacting Funding our Operations Our ability to operate our business depends on our ability to maintain our external financing, which is extremely challenging in the existing economic environment. We require a substantial amount of money to make new loans, repay indebtedness, fund obligations to existing clients and otherwise operate our business. To date, we have obtained this money through issuing equity, convertible debentures and subordinated debt, by borrowing money under our credit facilities, securitization transactions (hereinafter term debt) and repurchase agreements, and through deposits at CapitalSource Bank. Our access to these and other types of external funding depends on a number of factors, including general market and deposit raising conditions, the markets and our lenders perceptions of our business, our current and potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than 12 months and recently the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. These market forces have, in turn, put significant constraints on our ability to access and maintain prudent levels of liquidity through the sources described above. Our available cash and cash equivalents are 7.3% of our total assets, down from the levels we have historically maintained. The markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength. In addition, the economy is experiencing an economic recession with wide ranging impacts. We anticipate generating some of this liquidity by utilizing means we have not regularly used in the past, including sales of loans, loan participations, real estate investments and real estate owned. These sale activities are dependent on and subject to market and economic conditions and willing and able buyers entering into transactions with us and, therefore, are highly speculative. Furthermore, due to current market conditions, if we are able to consummate any asset sales we expect them to be at prices discounted to our current carrying value. If the current recession and levels of capital markets disruption and volatility continue or worsen, it is not certain that sufficient funding and capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Without sufficient funding, we would not be able to continue to operate our business. We are unable to access funds held by CapitalSource Bank to supplement our constrained liquidity position. We have made a significant investment in establishing CapitalSource Bank as a well-capitalized depository institution. Despite this investment, for regulatory reasons, CapitalSource Bank and the Parent Company are required to be operated independently of each other, and transactions between CapitalSource Bank and the Parent Company are restricted. For example, the Parent Company may not sell any loans to CapitalSource Bank. Furthermore, as a de novo bank, CapitalSource Bank is prohibited from paying dividends to the Parent Company for its first three years of operation. Consequently, while CapitalSource Bank may have more than adequate liquidity, the Parent Company is unable to directly benefit from that liquidity to fund its significant obligations and operations and must rely to a large extent on external sources of financing which, as described above, are extremely limited. 31 If our lenders terminate or fail to renew any of our credit facilities, we may not be able to continue to fund our business. As of February 25, 2009, we had six credit facilities totaling $1.8 billion in commitments. Two of these credit facilities aggregating $259.0 million in commitments, are scheduled to mature during 2009. We may not be able to renew or extend the term of these financings or to repay amounts outstanding under them when due. Additionally, if we breach a covenant or other provision of these facilities, the lenders could terminate them prior to their maturity dates. If any of these financings were terminated, not renewed upon its maturity or renewed on materially worse terms, our liquidity position could be materially adversely affected, and we may not be able to satisfy our outstanding obligations or continue to fund our operations. We have recently received waivers to potential covenant defaults under several of our credit facilities and have amended our largest credit facility to address our inability to satisfy certain financial covenants in the future. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to satisfy our obligations under our credit facilities or receive additional waivers or amendments should they be needed to avoid future defaults. We are currently in discussions with our credit facility lenders to restructure our credit facilities to extend maturities and gain funding efficiencies. If successful, we expect to see higher borrowing costs, potentially reduced committed capacity levels and/or lower advance rates on our secured credit facilities. We cannot assure you that we will successfully restructure these facilities on favorable terms or at all. If we are unsuccessful in this restructuring, we may be unable to meet our obligations under these credit facilities which could lead to an event of default, termination and other consequences which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Required commitment reductions in our syndicated credit facility as well as mandatory redemptions of our outstanding convertible debentures may limit our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity. We are required under our syndicated bank credit facility to make mandatory prepayments (which are accompanied by commitment reductions) in $25.0 million increments with a portion of the proceeds of specified events, including  75% of the cash proceeds of any unsecured debt issuance by the Parent Company,  25% of the cash proceeds of specified equity issuances, and  75% of any principal repayments on, or the cash proceeds received on the disposition of or the incurrence of secured debt with respect to, assets constituting collateral under the facility. Regardless of any such mandatory prepayments, the facility commitment reduces to  $1.0 billion on March 31, 2009,  $900.0 million on June 30, 2009, and  $700.0 million on December 31, 2009. If we are unable to sell sufficient assets, raise new capital or restructure this credit facility, we may not have sufficient liquidity to make these required prepayments by these dates. Consequently, we could default under this facility which would trigger cross-defaults under our other debt and could result in accelerated maturity of all of our debt. In such circumstances, our business, liquidity and operations would be materially adversely affected, and we would not be able to continue operating. We must comply with various covenants and obligations under our indebtedness and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, manage our portfolio or pursue certain opportunities. The Parent Company is required to comply with financial and non-financial covenants and obligations under our indebtedness, including, without limitation, with respect to interest coverage, minimum tangible net worth, leverage, maximum delinquent and charged-off loans and servicing standards. If we were to default under our indebtedness by violating these covenants or otherwise, our lenders remedies would include the ability to, among other things, transfer servicing to another servicer, accelerate payment of all amounts payable under such 32 indebtedness and/or terminate their commitments under such indebtedness. A default under our recourse indebtedness could trigger cross-default provisions in our other debt facilities, and a default under some of our non-recourse indebtedness would trigger cross-default provisions in other of our non-recourse debt. We have received waivers to potential breaches of some of these provisions and may have difficulty complying with some of these provisions if the economic recession continues or worsens. We recently amended our largest credit facility to adjust some of these covenants to levels we believe we can meet. Nevertheless, we may need to obtain additional waivers or amendments again in the future if we cannot satisfy all of the covenants and obligations under our debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such waivers or amendments in the future. A default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, liquidity position and our ability to continue to operate our business. In addition, upon the occurrence of specified servicer defaults, our lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of the asset-backed notes issued in our term debt may elect to terminate us as servicer of the loans under the applicable facility or term debt and appoint a successor servicer or replace us as cash manager for our secured facilities and term debt. If we were terminated as servicer, we would no longer receive our servicing fee. In addition, because there can be no assurance that any successor servicer would be able to service the loans according to our standards, the performance of our loans could be materially adversely affected and our income generated from those loans significantly reduced. Substantially all of the assets of the Parent Company are pledged or otherwise encumbered by liens we have granted in favor of our lenders. Our syndicated bank credit facility also contains customary operating and financial restrictions that may impair our ability to operate our business, including, among other things, covenants limiting our ability to:  incur various types of additional indebtedness and grant additional liens;  make specified investments;  merge with or into another person or consummate other transactions that could result in a change of control;  make capital expenditures;  pay dividends if we are in default; and/or  enter into transactions with affiliates. These restrictions may, among other things, reduce our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the economy and/or markets and thereby may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our commitments to lend additional amounts to existing clients exceed our resources available to fund these commitments. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of the Parent Companys unfunded commitments to extend credit with respect to existing loans exceeded unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by $1.4 billion. Due to their nature, we can not know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments. In many cases, our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings, the collaterals satisfaction of eligibility requirements, our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing, including compliance with all provisions of the loan agreements, and/or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements. In many other cases, however, there are no such prerequisites to future fundings by us and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time. In the past, the amount of unfunded commitments and potential for them to be drawn upon by our clients have not adversely affected our business. In light of current economic conditions and general lack of liquidity in the credit markets, however, clients have drawn and are more likely to continue to draw on our unfunded commitments to improve their weakening cash positions. Due to this fact and because our liquidity is more constrained than in the past, we expect that these unfunded commitments will continue to indefinitely exceed the Parent Companys available funds. Our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more 33 of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue in business. Our liquidity position has been and will continue to be adversely affected as a result of our inability to complete additional term debt transactions on favorable terms or at all. Prior to 2008, we had completed several term debt transactions involving loans in our commercial lending portfolio through which we raised a significant amount of debt capital to pay down our borrowings under our credit facilities and to create additional liquidity under our credit facilities for use in funding our loans. Our credit facilities were not designed to be long term financings, and their continued use depends on regularly paying them down with term debt proceeds. We have been unable to complete any term debt transactions since 2007, and the market for securitized loans has effectively been closed since that time. Consequently, we have been unable to pay down our credit facilities as anticipated using the proceeds from term debt transactions, which has constrained our liquidity position. Our cash flows from the interests we retain in our term debt have been, and we expect will continue to be, delayed or reduced due to the requirements of the term debt, which has impaired and could continue to impair our ability to fund our commitments under existing loans. We generally have retained the most junior classes of securities issued in our term debt transactions. Our receipt of cash flows on those junior securities is governed by provisions that control the distribution of cash flows from the loans included in our term debt transactions, which cash flows are tied to the performance of the underlying loans. As more delinquencies among loans included in the collateral pools of $4.6 billion of our outstanding term debt securitizations have occurred, the timing and amount of the cash flows we receive from loans included in our term debt transactions have been adversely affected and we expect these cash flows will continue to be adversely affected if delinquencies increase. In addition, under our term debt securitizations, the priority of payments are altered if the notes remain outstanding beyond the stated maturity dates and upon other termination events, in which case we would receive no cash flow from these transactions until the notes senior to our retained interests are retired. Fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our profit margins and ability to operate our business. We borrow money from our lenders at variable interest rates and raise short-term deposits at prevailing rates in the relevant markets. We generally lend money at variable rates based on either prime or LIBOR indices. Our operating results and cash flow depend on the difference between the interest rates at which we borrow funds and raise deposits and the interest rates at which we lend these funds. Because many of our loans are currently well below their contractual interest rate floors, upward movements in interest rates will not immediately result in additional interest income, although these movements would increase our cost of funds. Therefore, any upward movement in rates may result in a reduction of our net interest income. For additional information about interest rate risk, see Market Risk Management, in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Interest on some of our borrowings is based in part on the rates and maturities at which vehicles sponsored by our lenders issue asset backed commercial paper. Changes in market interest rates or the relationship between market interest rates and asset backed commercial paper rates could increase the effective cost at which we borrow funds under some of our debt facilities. In addition, changes in market interest rates, or in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates, or between different interest rate indices, could affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, which could result in an increase in interest expense relative to our interest income. Hedging instruments involve inherent risks and costs and may materially adversely affect our earnings. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements and other contracts for interest rate risk management purposes. Our hedging activity varies in scope based on a number of factors, including the level of interest rates, the 34 type of portfolio investments held, and other changing market conditions. Interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:  interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of volatile interest rates;  available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability or asset;  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay. Because we do not employ hedge accounting, our hedging activity may materially adversely affect our earnings. Therefore, while we pursue such transactions to reduce our interest rate risks, it is possible that changes in interest rates may result in losses that we would not otherwise have incurred if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. For additional information about our hedging instruments, see Note 23, Derivative Instruments, in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. The cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. We may increase our hedging activity and, thus, increase our hedging costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising. Furthermore, the enforceability of agreements associated with derivative instruments we use may depend on compliance with applicable statutory, commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. In the event of default by a counterparty to hedging arrangements, we may lose unrealized gains associated with such contracts and may be required to execute replacement contract(s) on market terms which may be less favorable to us. Although generally we seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. We cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses. We may enter into derivative contracts that could expose us to future contingent liabilities. Part of our investment strategy involves entering into derivative contracts that require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances. Our ability to fund these contingent liabilities will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to funding sources at the time, and the need to fund these contingent liabilities could materially adversely impact our financial condition. For additional information about our derivatives, see Note 23, Derivative Instruments, of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. Risks Related to Our Operations We may fail to benefit from the operation of CapitalSource Bank. We believe that our July 2008 formation of CapitalSource Bank will result in significant liquidity, operational and competitive benefits for us. Achieving these benefits will depend in part on overcoming our lack of experience operating in closely regulated markets and continuing to integrate CapitalSource Banks products, services, personnel and operations with the rest of our products, services, personnel and operations. Bank regulatory authorities have imposed requirements and limitations that could negatively affect the way we conduct CapitalSource Banks and the rest of our business and, therefore, could cause us to fail to realize the expected benefits of operating CapitalSource Bank. Further, the attention and effort devoted to the operation of CapitalSource Bank may divert managements attention from other important issues. There are no assurances that we can successfully operate CapitalSource Bank or realize any anticipated benefits from operating CapitalSource Bank. 35 We may fail to maintain or raise sufficient deposits or other sources of funding at CapitalSource Bank to operate our business. CapitalSource Banks ability to maintain or raise sufficient deposits may be limited by several factors, including:  competition from a variety of competitors, many of which offer a greater selection of products and services and have greater financial resources, including, without limitation, other banks, credit unions and brokerage firms;  as a California state-chartered industrial bank, CapitalSource Bank is permitted to offer only savings, money market and time deposit products, which limitations may adversely impact its ability to compete effectively;  the California deposit gathering markets where CapitalSource Banks branches are located have exhibited volatile and highly competitive deposit pricing strategies, and regulatory actions with respect to troubled institutions in those markets have spurred defensive pricing that we believe have caused, and may continue to cause, the impacted institutions to offer higher interest rates to their customers as they attempt to stave off significant outflows due to a lack of consumer confidence, all of which could require CapitalSource Bank to offer higher interest rates than desired to retain or grow our deposit base; and  perceptions of CapitalSource Banks quality could be adversely affected by depositors negative views of the Parent Company, which could cause depositors to withdraw their deposits or seek higher rates. While we expect to maintain and continue to raise deposits at a reasonable rate of interest, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. In addition, given the relatively short average maturity of CapitalSource Banks deposits compared to the maturity of its loans, the inability of CapitalSource Bank to raise or maintain deposits could compromise our ability to operate our business, impair our liquidity and threaten the solvency of CapitalSource Bank and the rest of CapitalSource. Aside from deposit funding, CapitalSource Bank may obtain back-up liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Bank-San Francisco and from the Parent Company. The current financial crisis threatens the availability of both of these sources of funds. Through its FHLB membership, CapitalSource Bank has access to a potential secondary source of liquidity. The Federal Home Loan Bank system is currently indicating that it may fail one or more capital requirements imposed upon it. If the Federal Home Loan Bank system is dissolved by Congress, CapitalSource Banks ability to access the Federal Home Loan Bank as a potential secondary course of liquidity and manage liquidity risk could be materially impacted. In addition, given the Parent Companys general liquidity constraints, CapitalSource Bank may not be able to draw on the $150 million revolving credit facility it has established with the Parent Company. As a result, if the ability of CapitalSource Bank to attract and retain suitable levels of deposits weakens, our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision which limit our flexibility and could result in adverse actions by regulatory agencies against us. We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision that govern, limit or otherwise affect the activities in which we may engage, our ability to use our capital for certain business purposes and our ability to expand our business. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not our shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to banking laws or regulations, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could materially affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit or restrict our ability to use capital for business purposes, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. In addition, increased regulatory requirements, whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations, changes in 36 existing laws and regulations, or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies or the regulatory orders pursuant to which CapitalSource Bank operates, even if unintentionally or inadvertently, could result, among other things, in sanctions by regulatory agencies, increased deposit insurance costs, civil monetary penalties or fines, issuing cease and desist or other supervisory orders or reputation damage. Supervisory actions also could result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums and additional limitations on our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1, Business, above, and Note 20, Bank Regulatory Capital, in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are located elsewhere in this report. The A Participation Interest may not pay down to the extent necessary to avoid losses. As the holder of the A Participation Interest, we are entitled to receive 70% of principal payments received with respect to the assets underlying the A Participation Interest, which include both loans and real estate owned. Certain of the loans underlying the A Participation Interest are in default from time to time. The loan portfolio underlying the A Participation Interest includes commercial real estate construction loans which may be more susceptible to default than other commercial loans. Given current economic conditions affecting the commercial and residential real estate markets, we expect the level of defaults, and the level of losses associated with such defaults, to increase. To the extent losses on the underlying assets exceed expectations, the amount of principal available for distribution to us as the holder of the A Participation Interest could be reduced to a level which would cause us to experience credit losses. If losses reach levels in excess of the credit-enhancement features of the A Participation Interest, we could experience losses which would adversely impact our financial results. Although as the holder of the A Participation Interest we have no obligation to make any further advances with respect to the assets underlying the A Participation Interest, the failure of iStar Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (iStar) as the lender with respect to the underlying assets to meet its funding obligations could also contribute to losses on the assets underlying the A Participation Interest. We also could experience losses in the event of the bankruptcy of iStar. iStar is the guarantor of the payment obligations to us as the holder of the A Participation Interest and such guaranty may be impaired if iStar files for bankruptcy. In the event of its bankruptcy, it is possible that iStar could commingle collections on the A Participation Interest with its other funds making it difficult to indentify the funds as our property and for us to receive our money. Moreover, the characterization of the A Participation Interest as a true participation could be challenged in the bankruptcy of iStar. If the challenge were successful, the A Participation Interest would likely be viewed as a secured loan to iStar, entitling iStar in certain circumstances to use the collections on the A Participation Interest and to restructure the obligations owed to us as the holder of the A Participation Interest as part of a bankruptcy reorganization plan. We have revoked our REIT election which could have adverse tax and legal implications. We operated as a REIT through 2008, but revoked our REIT election as of January 1, 2009. Commencing in 2009, we will be subject to corporate tax on all of our net income and we will no longer be required to pay any dividends to our shareholders. Further, we had agreed in contracts relating to some of our financings that we will use reasonable efforts to remain qualified as a REIT. While we believe our decision not to qualify as a REIT for 2009 was reasonable, it could nevertheless be deemed to breach certain of our agreements. If the counterparties to these financings allege breaches of those agreements, we may be subject to lengthy and costly litigation, and if we were not to prevail in such litigation, we may be required to repay certain indebtedness prior to stated maturity, which would materially impair our liquidity. 37 If it were determined that we violated REIT requirements or failed to qualify as a REIT in any given year during which we operated as a REIT, it could adversely impact our historical, current and future results of operations. We operated as a REIT from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008. Our senior management had limited experience in managing a portfolio of assets under the highly complex tax rules governing REITs and we cannot assure you that we successfully operated our business within the REIT requirements. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs and the importance of factual determinations, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, could contend that we violated REIT requirements in one or more of these years. We are currently under audit by the IRS for our 2006 and 2007 tax returns. To the extent it were to be determined that we did not comply with REIT requirements for one or more of our REIT years, we could be required to pay corporate federal income tax and certain state and local income taxes on our net income for the relevant years or we could be required to pay taxes that would be due if we were to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions to preserve our REIT status for the relevant years, either of which could have adverse affects on our historical, current and future financial results and the value of our common stock. The requirements of the Investment Company Act impose limits on our operations that impact the way we acquire and manage our assets and operations. We conduct our operations so as not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. We believe that we are primarily engaged in the business of commercial lending and real estate investment, and not in the business of investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities, and therefore are not required to register under the Investment Company Act. While we do not believe we are engaged in an investment company business, we nevertheless endeavor to conduct our operations in a manner that would permit us to rely on one or more exemptions under the Investment Company Act. Our ability to rely on these exemptions may limit the types of loans and other assets we own. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries, CapitalSource Finance LLC (Finance), is a guarantor on certain of our convertible debentures that were offered to the public in registered offerings. This guarantee could be deemed to cause Finance to have outstanding securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act. Finance or other subsidiaries may guarantee future indebtedness from time to time. Even if one or more of our subsidiaries were deemed to be engaged in investment company business, and the provisions of the Investment Company Act were deemed to apply on an individual basis to our wholly owned subsidiaries, generally they could rely either on an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act for banks or entities that do not offer securities to the public and do not have more than 100 security holders or on their operation as a REIT owning real property. Because it is possible such reliance could be deemed unavailable to Finance, we also conduct Finances business in a manner that we believe would permit it to rely on exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act. If we or any subsidiary were required to register under the Investment Company Act and could not rely on an exemption or exclusion, we or such subsidiary could be characterized as an investment company. Such characterization would require us to either change the manner in which we conduct our operations, or register the relevant entity as an investment company. Any modification of our business for these purposes could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, if we or a subsidiary were determined to be an unregistered investment company, we or such subsidiary:  could be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC and could be found to be in default of some of our indebtedness;  may be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, and third parties could seek to rescind transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we or such subsidiary was an unregistered investment company;  would have to significantly reduce the amount of leverage in our business;  would have to restructure operations dramatically; 38  may have to raise substantial amounts of additional equity to come into compliance with the limitations prescribed under the Investment Company Act; and  may have to terminate agreements with our affiliates. Any of these results likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial results and the price of our common stock. Changes in the values of our assets and subsidiaries and the income produced by them have made, and may make, it more difficult for us to maintain our exemptions from the Investment Company Act. If the market value of or net income from our non-qualifying assets at the Parent Company increase or the market value of or net income from CapitalSource Bank or our qualifying assets at the Parent Company decrease, we may need to increase our real estate investments and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets to maintain our exemptions from the Investment Company Act. If the declines or increases occur quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of many of our assets. We may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the Investment Company Act consideration, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial results and the price of our common stock. Our systems may experience an interruption or breach in security which could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities. We rely on the computer systems and network infrastructure we use to conduct our business. These systems and infrastructure could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our clients. In addition, we must be able to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us against physical damage, security breaches and service disruption caused by the internet or other users. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and deter potential clients. While we have systems, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful and that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. In addition, the failure of our clients to maintain appropriate security for their systems also may increase our risk of loss in connection with loans made to them. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of systems and infrastructure could damage our reputation, result in a loss of business and/or clients, result in losses to us or our clients, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, cause us to incur additional expenses, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. We review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our stock price, and could potentially subject us to litigation. 39 Risks Related to Our Lending Activities We may not recover all amounts that are contractually owed to us by our borrowers. We charged off $292.6 million in loans for the year ended December 31, 2008, and, in light of current economic and market conditions, we expect to experience additional charge-offs and delinquencies in the future. If we experience material losses on our portfolio, such losses would have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our business and on our revenues, net income and assets, to the extent the losses exceed our allowance for loan losses. In addition, like other commercial lenders, we have experienced missed and late payments, failures by clients to comply with operational and financial covenants in their loan agreements and client performance below that which we expected when we originated the loan. Any of these events may be an indication that our risk of credit loss with respect to a particular loan has materially increased. We make loans to other lenders and commercial real estate developers which have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the economic recession. These clients face a variety of risks relating to their underlying loans and development, construction and renovation projects, any of which may negatively impact their results of operations and impair their ability to pay principal and interest on our loans. We make loans to other lenders to finance their lending operations and to other clients for development, construction and renovation projects. The ability of these clients to make required payments to us on these loans is subject to the risks associated with their loans and these projects. An unsuccessful loan by, or development, construction or renovation project of, any such client could limit that clients ability to repay its obligations to us. Our concentration of loans to a limited number of clients within a particular industry or region could impair our revenues if the industry or region were to experience continued or worsening economic difficulties or changes in the regulatory environment. Defaults by our clients may be correlated with economic conditions affecting particular industries or geographic regions. As a result, if any particular industry or geographic region were to experience continuing or worsening economic difficulties, the overall timing and amount of collections on our loans to clients operating in those industries or geographic regions may differ from what we expected and result in material harm to our revenues, net income and assets. For example, as of December 31, 2008, loans representing 20.1% of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio were secured by commercial real estate other than healthcare facilities and three or $355.8 million of our 10 largest loans fall into this category. The commercial real estate sector is currently experiencing severe economic difficulties, and we expect this sector to deteriorate further in which case we are likely to suffer additional losses on these types of loans with increases in loan-to-value, delinquencies and foreclosures. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, loans representing 21.5% of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio were to clients in the healthcare industry. Reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid programs comprise the bulk of the revenues of many of these clients. Our clients dependence on reimbursement revenues could cause us to suffer losses in several instances.  If clients fail to comply with operational covenants and other regulations imposed by these programs, they may lose their eligibility to continue to receive reimbursements under the program or incur monetary penalties, either of which could result in the clients inability to make scheduled payments to us.  If reimbursement rates do not keep pace with increasing costs of services to eligible recipients, or funding levels decrease as a result of increasing pressures from Medicare and Medicaid to control healthcare costs, our clients may not be able to generate adequate revenues to satisfy their obligations to us.  If a healthcare client were to default on its loan, we would be unable to invoke our rights to the pledged receivables directly as the law prohibits payment of amounts owed to healthcare providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to be directed to any entity other than the actual providers. Consequently, we would need a court order to force collection directly against these governmental payors. There is no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining this type of court order. 40 We make loans to privately owned small and medium-sized companies that present a greater risk of loss than loans to larger companies. Our portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans to small and medium-sized, privately owned businesses. Compared to larger, publicly owned firms, these companies generally have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may be in a weaker financial position and may need more capital to expand or compete. These financial challenges may make it difficult for our clients to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on our loans. Accordingly, loans made to these types of clients entail higher risks than loans made to companies who are able to access traditional credit sources. We may not have all of the material information relating to a potential client at the time that we make a credit decision with respect to that potential client or at the time we advance funds to the client. As a result, we may suffer losses on loans or make advances that we would not have made if we had all of the material information. There is generally no publicly available information about the privately owned companies to which we lend. Therefore, we must rely on our clients and the due diligence efforts of our employees to obtain the information that we consider when making our credit decisions. To some extent, our employees depend and rely upon the management of these companies to provide full and accurate disclosure of material information concerning their business, financial condition and prospects. We may not have access to all of the material information about a particular clients business, financial condition and prospects, or a clients accounting records may be poorly maintained or organized. The clients business, financial condition and prospects may also change rapidly in the current economic environment. In such instances, we may not make a fully informed credit decision which may lead, ultimately, to a failure or inability to recover our loan in its entirety. Increases in interest rates could negatively affect our clients ability to repay their loans. Most of our loans bear interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest obligations of our clients may also increase. Some of our clients may not be able to make the increased interest payments, resulting in defaults on their loans. A clients fraud could cause us to suffer losses. The failure of a client to accurately report its financial position, compliance with loan covenants or eligibility for initial or additional borrowings could result in the loss of some or all of the principal of a particular loan or loans including, in the case of revolving loans, amounts we may not have advanced had we possessed complete and accurate information. Some of our clients require licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations to operate their businesses, which may be revoked or modified by applicable governmental authorities. Any revocation or modification could have a material adverse effect on the business of a client and, consequently, the value of our loan to that client. In addition to clients in the healthcare industry subject to Medicare and Medicaid regulation, clients in other industries require permits and licenses from various governmental authorities to operate their businesses. These governmental authorities may revoke or modify these licenses or permits if a client is found to be in violation of any regulation to which it is subject. In addition, these licenses may be subject to modification by order of governmental authorities or periodic renewal requirements or changes as a result of changes in the law. The loss of a permit, whether by termination, modification or failure to renew, could impair the clients ability to continue to operate its business in the manner in which it was operated when we made our loan to it, which could impair the clients ability to generate cash flows necessary to service our loan or repay indebtedness upon maturity, either of which outcomes would reduce our revenues, cash flow and net income. See the Regulation and Supervision section of Item 1, Business, above for additional discussion of specific regulatory and governmental oversight applicable to many of our healthcare clients. 41 Our loans to foreign clients may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in loans to U.S. clients. Loans to foreign clients may expose us to risks not typically associated with loans to U.S. clients. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. To the extent that any of our loans are denominated in foreign currency, these loans will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that these strategies will be effective. Because of the nature of our loans and the manner in which we disclose client and loan concentrations, it may be difficult to evaluate our risk exposure to any particular client or group of related clients. We use the term client to mean the legal entity that is the borrower party to a loan agreement with us or the tenant of one of our healthcare owned properties. We have several clients that are related to each other through common ownership or management. Because we underwrite each transaction separately, we report each transaction with one of these clients as a separate transaction and each client as a separate client. In situations where clients are related through common ownership, to the extent the common owner suffers financial distress, the common owner may be unable to continue to support our clients, which could, in turn, lead to financial difficulties for those clients. Further, some of our healthcare clients are managed by the same entity and, to the extent that management entity suffers financial distress or is otherwise unable to continue to manage the operations of the related clients, those clients could, in turn, face financial difficulties. In both of these cases, our clients could have difficulty servicing their debt to us, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. We may be unable to recognize or act upon an operational or financial problem with a client in a timely fashion so as to prevent a loss of our loan to that client. Our clients may experience operational or financial problems that, if not timely addressed by us, could result in a substantial impairment or loss of the value of our loan to the client. We may fail to identify problems because our client did not report them in a timely manner or, even if the client did report the problem, we may fail to address it quickly enough or at all. As a result, we could suffer loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and results of operations. We may make errors in evaluating information reported by our clients and, as a result, we may suffer losses on loans or advances that we would not have made if we had properly evaluated the information. We underwrite our loans based on detailed financial information and projections provided to us by our clients. Even if clients provide us with full and accurate disclosure of all material information concerning their businesses, our investment officers, underwriting officers and credit committee members may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze this information. Mistakes by our staff and credit committees may cause us to make loans that we otherwise would not have made, to fund advances that we otherwise would not have funded or result in losses on one or more of our existing loans. Our balloon loans and bullet loans may involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 93% of the outstanding balance of our commercial loans comprised either balloon loans or bullet loans. A balloon loan is a term loan with a series of scheduled payment installments calculated to amortize the principal balance of the loan so that, upon maturity of the loan, more than 25%, but less than 100%, of the loan balance remains unpaid and must be satisfied. A bullet loan is a loan with no scheduled 42 payments of principal before the maturity date of the loan. All of our revolving loans and some of our term loans are bullet loans. Balloon loans and bullet loans involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans because they require the borrower to, in many cases, make a large, final payment upon the maturity of the loan. The ability of a client to make this final payment upon the maturity of the loan typically depends upon its ability either to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan prior to maturity, to refinance the loan or to sell the related collateral securing the loan, if any. The ability of a client to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to the client, the financial condition of the client, the marketability of the related collateral, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, a client may not have the ability to repay the loan at maturity, and we could lose some or all of the principal of our loan. We are limited in pursuing certain of our rights and remedies under our Term B, second lien and mezzanine loans, which may increase our risk of loss on these loans. Term B loans generally are senior secured loans that are equal as to collateral and junior as to right of payment to clients other senior debt. Second lien loans are junior as to both collateral and right of payment to clients senior debt. Mezzanine loans may not have the benefit of any lien against a clients collateral and are junior to any lienholder both as to collateral (if any) and payment. Collectively, Term B, second lien and mezzanine loans comprised 12% of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. As a result of the subordinate nature of these loans, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights to collect principal and interest on these loans or to recover any of the loan balance through our right to foreclose upon collateral. For example, we typically are not contractually entitled to receive payments of principal on a subordinated loan until the senior loan is paid in full, and may only receive interest payments on a Term B, second lien or mezzanine loan if the client is not in default under its senior loan. In many instances, we are also prohibited from foreclosing on a Term B, second lien or mezzanine loan until the senior loan is paid in full. Moreover, any amounts that we might realize as a result of our collection efforts or in connection with a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under a Term B, second lien or mezzanine loan must generally be turned over to the senior lender until the senior lender has realized the full value of its own claims. These restrictions may materially and adversely affect our ability to recover the principal of any non-performing Term B, second lien or mezzanine loans. The collateral securing a loan may not be sufficient to protect us from a partial or complete loss if we have not properly obtained or perfected a lien on such collateral or if the loan becomes non-performing, and we are required to foreclose. While most of our loans are secured by a lien on specified collateral of the client, there is no assurance that we have obtained or properly perfected our liens, or that the value of the collateral securing any particular loan will protect us from suffering a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes non-performing and we move to foreclose on the collateral. Our cash flow loans are not fully covered by the value of assets or collateral of the client and, consequently, if any of these loans becomes non-performing, we could suffer a loss of some or all of our value in the loan. Cash flow lending involves lending money to a client based primarily on the expected cash flow, profitability and enterprise value of a client rather than on the value of its assets. These loans tend to be among the largest and to pose the highest risk of loss upon default in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 56% of the commercial loans in our portfolio were cash flow loans under which we had advanced 37% of the aggregate outstanding commercial loan balance of our portfolio. While in the case of our senior cash flow loans we generally take a lien on substantially all of the clients assets, the value of those assets is typically substantially less than the amount of money we advance to a client under a cash flow loan. When a cash flow loan becomes non-performing, our primary recourse to recover some or all of the principal of our loan is to force the sale of the entire company as a going concern. We could also choose to restructure the company in a way we believe would enable it to generate sufficient cash flow over time to repay our loan. Neither of these alternatives may be an available or viable option or 43 generate enough proceeds to repay the loan. Additionally, in an economic recession such as the current one, many businesses suffer decreases in revenues and net income, and we expect that many of our cash flow clients will suffer these decreases making them more likely to underperform and default on our loans and making it less likely that we could obtain sufficient proceeds from a restructuring or sale of the company. If we are a subordinate lender rather than the senior lender in a cash flow loan, our ability to take remedial action is constrained by our agreement with the senior lender. We are not the agent for a portion of our loans and, consequently, have little or no control over how those loans are administered or controlled. We are neither the agent of the lending group that receives payments under the loan nor the agent of the lending group that controls the collateral for purposes of administering the loan on loans comprising approximately 20% of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. When we are not the agent for a loan, we may not receive the same financial or operational information as we receive for loans for which we are the agent and, in many instances, the information on which we must rely is provided to us by the agent rather than directly by the client. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to track or rate these loans than it is for the loans for which we are the agent. Additionally, we may be prohibited or otherwise restricted from taking actions to enforce the loan or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or otherwise exercise remedies without the agreement of other lenders holding a specified minimum aggregate percentage, generally a majority or two-thirds of the outstanding principal balance. It is possible that an agent for one of these loans may not manage the loan to our standards or may choose not to take the same actions to enforce the loan, to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or to exercise remedies that we would or would not take if we were agent for the loan. We are the agent for loans in which syndicates of lenders participate and, in the event of a loss on any such loan, we could have liability to other members of the syndicate related to our management and servicing of the loan. We are often the agent representing a syndicate of multiple lenders that has made a loan. In that capacity, we may act on behalf of our co-lenders in administering the loan, receiving all payments under the loan and/or controlling the collateral for purposes of administering the loan. As of December 31, 2008, we were either the paying, administrative or the collateral agent or all for a group of third-party lenders for loans with outstanding commitments of $2.7 billion. When we are the agent for a loan, we often receive financial and/or operational information directly from the borrower and are responsible for providing some or all of this information to our co-lenders. We may also be responsible for taking actions on behalf of the lending group to enforce the loan, to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or to exercise remedies. It is possible that as agent for one of these loans we may not manage the loan to the applicable standard. In addition, we may choose a different course of action than one or more of our co-lenders would take to enforce the loan, to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or to exercise remedies if our co-lenders were in a position to manage the loan. If we do not administer these loans in accordance with our obligations and the applicable legal standards and the lending syndicate suffers a loss on the loan, we may have liability to our co-lenders. We may purchase distressed loans at amounts that may exceed what we are able to recover on these loans. We may purchase loans of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Although these investments may result in significant returns to us, they involve a substantial degree of risk. Any one or all of the loans which we purchase may be unsuccessful or not show any return for a considerable period of time. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for making a profit on the purchase of loans to companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is particularly high. We may not correctly evaluate the value of the assets collateralizing the loans or the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a distressed company, we may lose the entire amount of our loan, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than our purchase price and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time. 44 Our loans could be subject to equitable subordination by a court which would increase our risk of loss with respect to such loans. Courts may apply the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim or lien of a lender against a borrower to claims or liens of other creditors of the borrower, when the lender or its affiliates is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct. The courts have also applied the doctrine of equitable subordination when a lender or its affiliates is found to have exerted inappropriate control over a client, including control resulting from the ownership of equity interests in a client. We have made direct equity investments or received warrants in connection with loans representing approximately 21.3% of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008. Payments on one or more of our loans, particularly a loan to a client in which we also hold an equity interest, may be subject to claims of equitable subordination. If we were deemed to have the ability to control or otherwise exercise influence over the business and affairs of one or more of our clients resulting in economic hardship to other creditors of our client, this control or influence may constitute grounds for equitable subordination and a court may treat one or more of our loans as if it were unsecured or common equity in the client. In that case, if the client were to liquidate, we would be entitled to repayment of our loan on a pro-rata basis with other unsecured debt or, if the effect of subordination was to place us at the level of common equity, then on an equal basis with other holders of the clients common equity only after all of the clients obligations relating to its debt and preferred securities had been satisfied. We may incur lender liability as a result of our lending activities. A number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed lender liability. Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. We may be subject to allegations of lender liability. We cannot assure you that these claims will not arise or that we will not be subject to significant liability if a claim of this type does arise. We have engaged in the past, and may engage in the future, in lending transactions with affiliates of our directors. Because of the conflicts of interest inherent in these transactions, their terms may not be in our shareholders best interests. As of December 31, 2008, we had 9 loans representing $111.5 million in committed funds to companies affiliated with our directors. We may make additional loans to affiliates of our directors in the future. Although we generally require these transactions to be approved by the disinterested members of our board (or a committee thereof), such policy may not be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts of interest. These transactions may divert our resources and benefit our directors and their affiliates to the detriment of our shareholders. If we do not obtain or maintain the necessary state licenses and approvals, we will not be allowed to acquire, fund or originate residential mortgage loans and other loans in some states, which would adversely affect our operations. We engage in consumer mortgage lending activities which involve the collection of numerous accounts, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local laws that regulate consumer lending. Many states in which we do business require that we be licensed, or that we be eligible for an exemption from the licensing requirement, to conduct our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all the necessary licenses and approvals, or be granted an exemption from the licensing requirements, that we will need to maximize the acquisition, funding or origination of residential mortgages or other loans or that we will not become liable for a failure to comply with the myriad of regulations applicable to our lines of business. 45 We are in a competitive business and may not be able to take advantage of attractive opportunities. Our markets are competitive and characterized by varying competitive factors. We compete with a large number of financial services companies, including:  specialty and commercial finance companies;  commercial banks and thrifts;  REITS and other real estate investors;  private investment funds;  investment banks;  insurance companies; and  asset management companies. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and market positions than we do. They also have greater access to capital than we do and at a lower cost than is available to us. Furthermore, we would expect to face increased price competition if finance companies seek to expand within or enter our target markets. Increased competition could cause us to reduce our pricing and lend greater amounts as a percentage of a clients eligible collateral or cash flows. Even with these changes, in an increasingly competitive market, we may not be able to attract and retain new clients or maintain or grow our business and our market share and future revenues may decline. If our existing clients choose to use competing sources of credit to refinance their loans, the rate at which loans are repaid may be increased, which could change the characteristics of our loan portfolio as well as cause our anticipated return on our existing loans to vary. The mortgage loans underlying our residential mortgage investments are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us. We invest in residential mortgage related receivables that are secured by pools of residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, these investments are subject to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans are secured by single-family residential property. They are subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which increased significantly in 2008 as the economy contracted, real estate values declined and credit markets froze. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property depends on the income or assets of the borrower and many factors may impair borrowers abilities to repay their loans, including the current economic recession. Foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be expensive and lengthy. Our investments in mortgage related receivables would be adversely affected by defaults under the loans underlying such securities. To the extent losses are realized on the loans underlying the mortgage related receivables in which we invest, we may not recover a portion or all of the amount invested in such mortgage related receivables. Debtor-in-possession loans may have a higher risk of default. Debtor-in-possession loans to clients that have filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code are used by these clients to fund on-going operations as part of the reorganization process. While our security position for these loans is generally better than that of the other asset-based loans we make, there may be a higher risk of default on these loans due to the uncertain business prospects of these clients and the inherent risks with the bankruptcy process. Furthermore, if our calculations as to the outcome or timing of a reorganization are inaccurate, the client may not be able to make payments on the loan on time or at all. We may not retain control over our joint venture investments, which may increase the risk of loss with respect to such investments. We are party to joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures. We may not have control of the operations of the joint ventures in which we invest. Therefore, these investments may, under certain circumstances, involve risks such as the possibility that our partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, or be in a position to take action contrary to our 46 instructions or requests or our policies or objectives. As a result, these investments may be subject to more risk than investments for which we have full operational or management responsibility. Risks Related to our Direct Real Estate Investments We are exposed to liabilities, including environmental liabilities, with respect to properties to which we take title. Owning real estate can subject us to liabilities for injury to persons on the property or property damage. To the extent that any such liabilities are not adequately covered by insurance, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to properties we own. We may be liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases, at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have experienced and may continue to experience losses if the creditworthiness of our tenants leasing our healthcare properties deteriorates and they are unable to meet their obligations under our leases. We own healthcare properties leased to tenants from whom we receive rents during the terms of our leases. A tenants ability to pay rent is determined by the creditworthiness of the tenant. If a tenants credit deteriorates, the tenant could default on its obligations under our lease and the tenant may also become bankrupt. The bankruptcy or insolvency or other failure to pay of our tenants is likely to adversely affect the income produced by many of our direct real estate investments. The operators of our healthcare properties are faced with increased litigation, rising insurance costs and enhanced government scrutiny that may affect their ability to make payments to us. Advocacy groups that monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities have sued healthcare operators and called upon state and federal legislatives to enhance their oversight of trends in healthcare facility ownership and quality of care. Patients have also sued healthcare facility operators and have, in certain cases, succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect of this litigation and potential litigation in the future has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition, the cost of medical malpractice and liability insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of healthcare facilities continues. Increased costs could limit our operators ability to make payments to us, potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs. To the extent we are required to remove or replace the operators of our healthcare properties, our revenue from those properties could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time. Since real estate investments are illiquid and the real estate markets are experiencing significant disruption, we may not be able to sell properties when we desire. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly and sales have become extremely difficult in the current real estate market disruption and economic recession. We may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to continued changes in the real estate market. This inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our ability to service our debt. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:  changes in interest rates and in the availability, costs and terms of financing;  adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions;  the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;  changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning and other ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations; 47  changes in operating expenses; and  civil unrest, acts of war and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses. We cannot predict how long it may take us to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. We also cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. State laws mandate certain procedures for property foreclosures, and in certain states, we would face a time consuming foreclosure process with respect to mortgage loans that default, during which time the property could be subject to waste. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Risks Related to our Common Stock We may issue additional shares of common stock at prices that are dilutive to our existing shareholders. Given our desire to maintain and improve our liquidity position and our declining stock price, we may issue equity or equity linked securities at prices that are dilutive to our shareholders, which may result in a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock. These issuances could be for cash or in exchange for outstanding debt securities in cases where we either do not have sufficient cash to pay off those debt securities or believe it would be more prudent to conserve our cash. We may or may not pay dividends on our common stock. We expect to retain a majority of our earnings, consistent with dividend policies of other commercial depository institutions, to redeploy in our business. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine the amount and frequency of dividends to our shareholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions prohibiting the payment of dividends after defaults. Consequently, we can not assure you that we will pay any dividend on our common stock or that dividend levels will not fluctuate or be more or less than expected. If we change our dividend policy our stock price could be adversely affected. Acquisitions may adversely impact our business. As part of our business strategy, we have made acquisitions in the past and we may continue to do so in the future. Future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of additional debt. In addition, we may face additional risks from future acquisitions, including:  difficulties in integrating the operations, services, products and personnel of the acquired company or asset portfolio;  heightened risks of credit losses as a result of acquired assets not having been originated by us in accordance with our rigorous underwriting standards;  the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  the potentially adverse effects that acquisitions may have in terms of the composition and performance of our assets;  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and  inability to meet applicable regulatory requirements. If a substantial number of shares available for sale are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline. If our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. As of February 17, 2009, we had 302,595,100 shares of 48 common stock outstanding and options then exercisable for 5,203,209 shares were held by our employees and directors. Subject, in some cases, to Rule 144 compliance, all of these shares are eligible for sale in the public market. The perception in the public market that our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress our market price. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities. As of January 1, 2009, 6,655,053 shares of our common stock were beneficially owned by certain trusts that are affiliates of Farallon Capital Management and its affiliates (the Farallon Trusts), the principal business of each of which is to liquidate its assets over time. Dispositions of some or all of the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the Farallon Trusts or other Farallon entities could adversely impact the price of our common stock. The perception in the public market that Farallon entities might sell shares of common stock also could depress our market price. Similarly, if we were to issue a substantial amount of common stock in exchange for outstanding indebtedness, as we did in October 2008 and February 2009, and the recipients were to sell such common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. Some provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for, among other things:  a classified board of directors;  restrictions on the ability of our shareholders to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;  the authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval; and  advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals. We also are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts the ability of any shareholder that at any time holds more than 15% of our voting shares to acquire us without the approval of shareholders holding at least 662/3% of the shares held by all other shareholders that are eligible to vote on the matter. Our board of directors has provided a waiver to Farallon Capital Management and its affiliates to acquire common stock in excess of 15% for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions than you desire. Insiders continue to have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. Our directors, executive officers and entities affiliated with them owned shares of common stock equaling approximately 26% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of February 17, 2009. As a result, these shareholders, if acting together, would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.
