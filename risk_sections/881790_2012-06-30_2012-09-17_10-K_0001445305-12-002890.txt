Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe following are certain material risks that our management believes are specific to us and our business. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such potential risks and, as such, this list of risk factors should not be viewed as all-inclusive or in any particular order. An investment in our common stock involves certain risks. Before making an investment decision, you should read carefully and consider the risk factors below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K and information incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are set forth in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us at this time or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business and operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.Risks Related to Our Industry and BusinessDifficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected our industry.We are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain world, national and local conditions. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption since 2008. Dramatic declines in the housing market, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures, have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions across the United States. General downward economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. This market turmoil and tightening of credit led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies, lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:•We face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities;•Customer demand for loans secured by real estate could be further reduced due to weaker economic conditions, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or an increase in interest rates;•The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process;•The value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected; and•We may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums in the future because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and the resolution of problem banks continues to decrease the 31Table of Contentsfunds available.The Dodd-Frank Act will, among other things, result in increased capital standards, and further new laws and regulations, which create regulatory uncertainty and which are expected to continue to significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs.Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has changed and will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of banking institutions and their holding companies, which is expected to continue to significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs.The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions. Moreover, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies will for the first time become subject to the same capital and activity requirements as those applicable to bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution, including savings and loan holding companies, serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary savings associations' depository institution(s). The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of all insured depository institutions and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements. All of these actions are expected to further increase our regulatory compliance costs. As a result of regulatory restructuring called for by the Dodd-Frank Act, effective July 21, 2011, the Federal Reserve became the primary federal regulator of the Company and the OCC became the primary federal regulator of the Bank. In concurrence with the transfer of parent company supervisory authority from the OTS to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance aligning the supervisory and regulatory standards for savings and loan holding companies more closely with the standards applicable to bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve had also indicated that its supervision of savings and loan holding companies may entail a more rigorous level of review than previously applied by the OTS. As a result, we are subject to new examination, regulatory and reporting requirements that could be more stringent than the OTS examinations we have had historically.The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new government agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions like the Bank, including the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices.We are continuing to closely monitor and evaluate developments under the Dodd-Frank Act, which have increased regulatory uncertainty and which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations through significant increases in our regulatory compliance costs. Legislative and regulatory initiatives taken to date may not achieve their intended objectives; proposed and future initiatives may substantially increase compliance burdens or impact our sources of revenue and further impact our financial condition or results of operations.Legislative and regulatory initiatives taken to date by Congress and the federal banking regulators to address financial regulatory reform may not achieve their intended objectives, thereby requiring additional legislation or regulation of the financial services industry. Furthermore, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and other international bodies comprised of banking regulators have committed to raise capital standards and liquidity buffers within the banking system by imposing new requirements. On June 12, 2012, the OCC and other federal banking agencies issued notices of proposed rulemakings that revise each agency's risk-based and leverage capital requirements consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, including implementation of a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement. Additionally, consistent with Basel III, the OCC and other federal banking agencies propose to apply limits on a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified "buffer" of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The proposed rulemaking also would revise the agencies' prompt corrective action framework by incorporating the new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of tangible common equity. These capital requirements are proposed to be phased in beginning in January 2013. We cannot predict the impact that such proposals, once adopted, would have upon our financial condition or results of operations.As a result of current economic conditions, the Bank's allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in its loan portfolios, which could adversely affect its operating results.While the Bank maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, losses 32Table of Contentsmay exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss. At June 30, 2012, the Bank's nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans still accruing but past due greater than 90 days) totaled $16.2 million, or 2.37% of its loan portfolio. At June 30, 2012, the Bank's nonperforming assets (which include foreclosed real estate) were $17.8 million, or 1.49% of assets. In addition, the Bank had $6.7 million in accruing loans that were 30 to 89 days delinquent at June 30, 2012. At June 30, 2012, the Bank held $10.6 million of loan and lease loss reserves, or 1.55% of total loans, and 65.29% of nonperforming loans.Until economic and market conditions improve, the Bank may continue to incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming loans. The Bank does not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting its income, and increasing its loan administration costs. When the Bank takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may result in a loss. These loans and other real estate owned also increase its risk profile and the capital its regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. As a result of current economic conditions, additional provisions for loan losses may be necessary.The Bank makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. The Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses is based on these judgments, as well as historical loss experience and an evaluation of the other risks associated with the loan portfolio, including but not limited to, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic condition and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. The Bank's allowance is also periodically reviewed by its regulators. If the Bank's assumptions or judgments used to determine the allowance proves to be incorrect, if the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases substantially or if the Bank's regulators disagree with the Bank's judgments, the Bank may need to increase the allowance in amounts that exceed its expectations. Material additions to the allowance would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires significant estimates, and actual losses may vary from current estimates.The Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in its portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us and the Bank to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.In evaluating the adequacy of the Bank's allowance for loan losses, we consider numerous quantitative factors, including our historical charge-off experience, growth of our loan portfolio, changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans. In addition, we use information about specific borrower situations, including their financial position and estimated collateral values, to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers. Finally, we consider many qualitative factors, including general and economic business conditions, duration of the current business cycle, current general market collateral valuations, trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters, which are by nature subjective and fluid. Our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding the Bank's borrowers' abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors. In considering information about specific borrower situations, our analysis is subject to the risk that we are provided inaccurate or incomplete information. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, the Bank's actual losses may vary from our current estimates.Additionally, bank regulators periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the Bank's allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory authorities may adversely affect our operating results.We are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.Our financial success is dependent on the prevailing economic, political and business conditions as well as the population growth in South Dakota and Minnesota.Our success and growth is dependent on the income levels, deposits and population growth in our primary market area, 33Table of Contentswhich are communities located in eastern and central South Dakota, including the Sioux Falls metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and the cities of Pierre, Mitchell, Aberdeen, Brookings, Dakota Dunes, Watertown and Yankton, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally are unfavorable, our business will be negatively affected.Additionally, there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities, including credit risk, which is the risk that borrowers may not repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing loans decreases. Our business operations and activities are predominantly concentrated in the state of South Dakota and most of our credit exposure is in that state, so we are specifically at risk from adverse economic, political and business conditions that affect South Dakota. Accordingly, economic and business conditions in South Dakota, such as increases in unemployment, commercial and consumer delinquencies and real estate foreclosures, as well as decreases in real gross domestic product, home and land prices or home sales, will each adversely impact our credit risk.For example, credit card issuers, a significant employer in the Sioux Falls MSA, are subject to recently enacted legislation that may result in their interest income and loan fee income being significantly reduced, which could cause these companies to scale back their operations and reduce personnel. A reduction in such operations and personnel could negatively affect the economic conditions in South Dakota, which in return could negatively impact our credit risk and business.Our financial success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in highly competitive markets.We operate in the highly competitive markets of South Dakota and Minnesota. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets. Through the Bank, we compete for loans, deposits and other financial services in geographic markets with other local, regional and national commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business. Larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can and have broader customer and geographic bases to draw upon.Competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us. Through the Bank, we compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. There is a risk that we will not be able to compete successfully with these other financial institutions in our markets, and that we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits or charge lower interest rates to obtain loan volume, resulting in reduced profitability. In new markets that we may enter, we will also compete against well-established community banks that have developed relationships within the community.We are subject to extensive regulations that may limit or restrict our activities, and the cost of compliance is high.We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies, currently including the OCC, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the DIF and depositors, not stockholders. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to regulatory capital requirements, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our ability to grow, our cost of funds and FDIC insurance, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, and our ability to make acquisitions could be materially and adversely affected.Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail expansion opportunities.Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the federal government has imposed and is expected to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks. We have developed policies and continue to augment procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations.34Table of ContentsLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our financial condition.Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources to accommodate our existing and future lending and investment activities could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity and severely constrain our financial flexibility. Our primary source of funding is retail deposits gathered through our network of branch offices. Our alternative funding sources include, without limitation, brokered certificates of deposit, federal funds purchased, Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowings, FHLB of Des Moines advances and short- and long-term debt.The Bank has historically obtained funds principally through local deposits and it has a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Generally, we believe local deposits are a cheaper and more stable source of funds than other borrowings, because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders and reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits, whereas brokered deposits typically are higher cost time deposits.Our costs of funds, profitability and liquidity will be adversely affected to the extent we have to rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs, and changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.The Bank currently has a $15.0 million unsecured line of federal funds with First Tennessee Bank, NA, which did not have an outstanding balance at June 30, 2012 and 2011. The line was advanced upon during the past 12 months for contingent funding testing purposes.The Bank currently has a $20.0 million unsecured line of federal funds with Zions Bank, which did not have an outstanding balance at June 30, 2012 and 2011. The line was advanced upon during the past 12 months for contingent funding testing purposes.We may look to sell production assets, such as mortgage loans, into the secondary market as a means to manage the size of our balance sheet and manage the use of our capital. The demand for these products in the capital markets is not driven by us and may not benefit us at the time we look to sell the loans.Our liquidity, on a parent only basis, may be adversely affected by certain restrictions on receiving dividends from the Bank without prior regulatory approval.Our profitability may be affected by changes in market interest rates.Through our banking subsidiary, the Bank, our profitability depends in large part on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from interest-earning assets, such as loans and mortgage-backed securities, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increase faster than the interest earned on loans and investments.Our results of operations will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of lending institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, in order to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of U.S. government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. If short-term interest rates rise, and if rates on our deposits and borrowings re-price upwards faster than the rates on our long-term loans and investments, we may experience compression of our net interest margin, which will have a negative effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.While we intend to manage the effects of changes in interest rates by adjusting the terms, maturities and pricing of our assets and liabilities, our efforts may not be effective in a changing rate environment and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.The repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense.All federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, beginning on July 21, 2011, financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients. Our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract new customers or maintain current customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 35Table of ContentsA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate; therefore, we have a high degree of risk from a downturn in our real estate markets and the local economy and face risks that are unique to holding foreclosed real estate.A further downturn in the real estate market and local economy in South Dakota could hurt our business because a significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate located in South Dakota. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by, among other things, changes in regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and the availability of loans to potential purchasers. If real estate values further decline in South Dakota, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be significantly reduced. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.Additionally, the Bank faces certain risks that are unique to holding foreclosed real estate, such as the risk that hazardous or toxic substances are found on the foreclosed property, which may require the Bank to incur substantial expenses to remediate or materially reduce the property's value. Although the Bank has policies and procedures in place to ensure that an environmental review is performed before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may turn out to be insufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard in connection with foreclosed real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We have significant exposure to risks associated with the agriculture industry due to our loan concentration.Agricultural loans comprised 22.7% of our total loan and lease portfolio at June 30, 2012. A number of these loans have relatively large balances. Payments on agricultural loans are dependent on the profitable operation or management of the farm property securing the loans. The deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. Our agricultural loans may involve a greater degree of risk than other loans, and the ability of the borrower to repay may be affected by many factors outside of the borrower's control, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products and the impact of government regulations (including changes in price supports, subsidies and environmental regulations). In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The primary crops in our market areas are corn and soybeans. Accordingly, adverse circumstances affecting these crops could have an adverse effect on our agricultural loan portfolio. While virtually all of our agricultural operating loan crop borrowers utilize federal crop insurance programs to insure against weather-related losses, we cannot be certain that insurance coverages will be adequate to fully satisfy cash flow and associated operating requirements. Furthermore, any extended period of low commodity prices, significantly reduced yields on crops, reduced levels of government assistance to the agricultural industry and/or reduced farmland values could result in a significant increase in our nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of net income from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and/or an increase in loan charge-offs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Future acquisitions and expansion activities may disrupt our business, dilute existing stockholders and adversely affect our operating results.We intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities in the normal course of our business. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we may not be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, thrifts, or financial service companies, as well as other geographic and product expansion activities, involve various risks including:•risks of unknown or contingent liabilities;•unanticipated costs and delays;36Table of Contents•risks that acquired new businesses do not perform consistent with our growth and profitability expectations;•risks of entering new markets or product areas where we have limited experience;•risks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures;•exposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions;•difficulties, expenses and delays of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired institutions, and start-up delays and costs of other expansion activities;•potential disruptions to our business;•possible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;•potential short-term decreases in profitability; and•diversion of our management's time and attention from our existing operations and business.We may participate in FDIC-assisted acquisitions, which could present additional risks to our financial condition.We may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of troubled financial institutions in transactions facilitated by the FDIC. In addition to the risks frequently associated with acquisitions, an acquisition of a troubled financial institution may involve a greater risk that the acquired assets underperform compared to our expectations. Because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition, including preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks including, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems. Additionally, while the FDIC may agree to assume certain losses in transactions that it facilitates, there can be no assurances that we would not be required to raise additional capital as a condition to, or as a result of, participation in an FDIC-assisted transaction. Any such transactions and related issuances of stock may have dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership.Attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.We expect that other banking and financial service companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, will compete with us in acquiring other banks, thrifts, and financial service companies. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and stockholders' equity per share of our common stock.We may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.We are required by regulatory agencies to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations and such levels may be increased by legislative and regulatory developments. To complete any future acquisitions and expansion activities, we may need to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through organic or external growth could be materially impaired.In the event that we are able to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other securities, the ownership interests of current investors would be diluted and the per share book value of our common stock may be diluted. New investors may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock, which may adversely affect the holders of our common stock.We are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Furthermore, we have access to large amounts of confidential financial information and control substantial financial assets, including those belonging to our customers, to whom we offer remote access, and we regularly transfer substantial financial assets by electronic means. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, 37Table of Contentssubject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on standard Internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures.We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints caused by third parties that facilitate our business activities by providing technology such as software applications, as well as financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, assimilate and retain highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.As a community bank, we expect our future growth to be driven in large part by the relationships that our personnel maintain with our customers. We depend on the talents and leadership of our executive team, including Stephen M. Bianchi, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brent R. Olthoff, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. There is an increasing risk in our industry around the lack of human capital with experience, training and skills in financial services. Therefore, the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense. The inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business. Adverse weather affecting the markets we serve could hurt our business and prospects for growth.The South Dakota economy, in general, is heavily dependent on agriculture and therefore the overall South Dakota economy, and particularly the economies of the rural communities that we serve, can be greatly affected by severe weather conditions, including droughts, storms, tornadoes and flooding. Unfavorable weather conditions may decrease agricultural productivity or could result in damage to our branch locations or the property of our customers, all of which could adversely affect the local economy. An adverse affect on the economy of South Dakota would negatively affect our profitability.Changes in or interpretations of accounting standards may materially impact our financial statements.Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, interpretations and practices for many aspects of our business are complex and involve subjective judgments, including, but not limited to, accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses and pending and incurred but not reported health claims. Changes in these estimates or changes in other accounting rules and principles, or their interpretation, could significantly change our reported net income and operating results, and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations.The holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders.We have supported our continued growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying sales of junior subordinated debentures to these trusts. The accompanying junior subordinated debentures have an aggregate liquidation amount totaling $27.8 million as of June 30, 2012. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures that we issued to the trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock.Risks Relating to Our Common StockThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.The stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility during the recent economic downturn. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. As a result, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur. This may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.38Table of ContentsThe trading price of the shares of our common stock will depend on many factors that may change from time to time and may be beyond our control. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are those identified in the section entitled "Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and as follows:•actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;•changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our common stock or those of other financial institutions;•failure to meet analysts' revenue or earnings estimates;•speculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation, our market area, our competitors or the financial services industry in general;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;•actions by our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by existing stockholders and/or directors and executive officers;•fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;•future sales of our equity, equity-related or debt securities;•changes in the frequency or amount of dividends or share repurchases;•proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;•anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us;•trading activities in our common stock, including short-selling;•domestic and local economic factors unrelated to our performance; and•general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.Our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from our banking subsidiary, the Bank, which is subject to regulatory limits.We are a unitary thrift holding company and our operations are conducted primarily by our banking subsidiary, the Bank. Since we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on our receipt of dividends from the Bank.Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net income and retained earnings. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is also subject to its profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. The Bank may not be able to generate adequate cash flow to pay us dividends in the future. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Furthermore, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive the dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Additionally, we may elect in the future to defer interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures discussed above. The debenture agreements prohibit dividend payments on our common stock following the deferral of interest payments on the subordinated debentures underlying the trust preferred securities.The trading volume in our common stock has been low, and the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could depress the price of our common stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares.Our common stock is listed to trade on The Nasdaq Global Market but is thinly traded. As a result, you may not be able to sell your shares of common stock on short notice. Additionally, thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in 39Table of Contentsan active public market. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock at one time could depress the market price of our common stock, making it difficult for you to sell your shares and impairing our ability to raise capital.We may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We may evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets taking into account our regulatory capital ratios, financial condition and other relevant considerations, and subject to market conditions, we may take further capital actions. Such actions could include, among other things, the issuance of additional shares of common stock in public or private transactions in order to further increase our capital levels above the requirements for a well-capitalized institution established by the federal bank regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory targets.We face significant regulatory and other governmental risks as a financial institution, and it is possible that capital requirements and directives could in the future require us to change the amount or composition of our current capital, including common equity.The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as Delaware and federal law, may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of control of us.Certain provisions included in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and federal law, may discourage, delay or prevent potential acquisitions of control of us, particularly when attempted in a transaction that is not negotiated directly with, and approved by, our Board of Directors, despite possible benefits to our stockholders.Specifically, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as the case may be, include certain provisions that:•limit the voting power of shares held by a stockholder beneficially owning in excess of 10% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock;•require that certain business combinations between us and a stockholder beneficially owning in excess of 10% of the then-outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, or be approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote if the business combination (i) is approved by a majority of the Board of Directors serving prior to the 10% stockholder becoming such, and/or (ii) involves consideration per share generally equal to that paid by such 10% stockholder when such stockholder acquired his, her or its stock;•divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms and provide that a director may only be removed prior to the expiration of a term for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in an election of directors;•require that a special meeting of stockholders be called pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our Board of Directors;•authorize the issuance of preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors; and•require that an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation be approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of our directors then in office and thereafter by our stockholders by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a stockholders meeting called for that purpose; provided, however, with respect to the amendment of certain provisions regarding, among other things, provisions relating to the voting limits of holders of more than 10% of our common stock, the number, classification, election and removal of directors, amendment of the Bylaws, call of special stockholder meetings, acquisitions of control, director liability, and certain business combinations, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of our capital stock required by applicable law or by our Certificate of 40Table of ContentsIncorporation, such amendments must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of our then-outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.Furthermore, federal law requires Federal Reserve approval prior to any direct or indirect acquisition of "control" (as defined in Federal Reserve regulations) of the Bank, including any acquisition of control of us. By statute, a company would be found to "control" the Bank if the Company: (1) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of the Company or Bank; (2) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the Company's or Bank's board; or (3) directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Company and Bank. The Federal Reserve's implementing regulations include a specific definition of "control" similar to the statutory definition, with certain additional provisions. In addition to the rebuttable presumptions of control set forth in the implementing regulations, the Federal Reserve's supervision manual for supervised institutions provides that there are a number of other circumstances that are indicative of control and may call for further investigation to uncover facts that support a determination of control.Item 1B.
