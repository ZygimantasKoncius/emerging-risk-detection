Barry Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Companys annual reporting period is either a fifty-two or fifty-three-week period (fiscal year) ending annually on the Saturday nearest June 30. For definitional purposes, as used herein, the terms listed below include the respective periods noted: Fiscal 2009 52 weeks ending June 27, 2009 Fiscal 2008 52 weeks ended June 28, 2008 Fiscal 2007 52 weeks ended June 30, 2007 2006 fifty-two-week period 52 weeks ended July 1, 2006 2006 transition period 26 weeks ended July 1, 2006 2005 twenty-six-week period 26 weeks ended July 2, 2005 Fiscal 2005 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 3 Table of Contents PART I Item 1. Business. General Information and Recent Developments R.G. Barry Corporation was incorporated in Ohio in 1984. Together with its predecessors, the Company has been in operation since April 1947. The Company designs, purchases, markets and distributes accessory footwear products. The Company defines accessory footwear as a product category that encompasses primarily slippers, sandals, hybrid and active fashion footwear and slipper socks. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 13405 Yarmouth Road N.W., Pickerington, Ohio 43147 and its telephone number is (614) 864-6400. From December 2, 2005 through March 9, 2008, the Companys common shares were principally traded on the American Stock Exchange LLC (AMEX) under the symbol DFZ, evoking the Companys flagship brand name: Dearfoams*. On March 10, 2008, the Companys common shares began trading on The NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ-GM) under the trading symbol: DFZ. As previously reported, in May of 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a change to the Companys fiscal year-end to the Saturday nearest June 30 from the Saturday nearest December 31. This change aligned the Companys fiscal year more closely with the seasonal nature of its business. Prior to June 30, 2007, the Company operated in two segments: the Barry North America Group, which included accessory footwear products marketed and sold in North America; and the Barry Europe Group, which included footwear products sold by Fargeot, primarily in France and other Western European markets. With the sale of Escapade, S.A. and its Fargeot et Compagnie, S.A. subsidiary (collectively, Fargeot), which was reported as discontinued operations as of the end of fiscal 2007, the Company reports its operations as a single operating segment, North America. Selected financial information about the Companys operating segments by geographic region for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, the 2006 transition period and fiscal 2005 is presented in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. in this 2008 Form 10-K. The Company makes available free of charge through its Internet website all annual reports on Form 10-K, all quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, all current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, filed or furnished by the Company pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These reports are available through the Companys website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are submitted electronically to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Companys website address is www.rgbarry.com (this uniform resource locator, or URL, is an inactive textual reference only and is not intended to incorporate the Companys website on this 2008 Form 10-K). In June of 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to sell its 100% ownership in Fargeot, which was completed in July 2007. As a result of this sale, the Company now depends solely upon third parties to manufacture all of its products. The sale of Fargeot is discussed further in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. of this 2008 Form 10-K. In fiscal 2008, the Company terminated a licensing * Denotes a trademark of the Company registered in the United States Department of Commerce Patent and Trademark Office. 4 Table of Contents agreement for the sale, marketing and distribution of its slipper product brands in Europe with a subsidiary of a privately-held British comfort footwear and apparel firm, GBR Limited. The Company reported approximately $50,000, $146,000, $107,000 and $385,000 in royalty income under this agreement for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, the 2006 transition period and fiscal 2005, respectively. Changes in the Barry North America Business Model The market for the Companys accessory footwear products continues to be challenged by two critical market changes: globalization and retail consolidation. The convergence of these forces, along with the current economic conditions, represented primarily by the increase in energy costs, has created a very competitive marketplace for suppliers of this product category. The Company expects that these conditions will continue in the future. In response to the challenges it was facing, in fiscal 2004, the Company implemented a new operating model that transitioned its business, exclusive of its then-owned Fargeot business, from a manufacturer of footwear to a distributor of goods purchased from third-party manufacturers. Since closing its manufacturing operations in fiscal 2004, the Company has sourced all of its product requirements from third-party manufacturers, substantially all of which are located in China. The Company believes that the cost savings it recognizes by sourcing its products from third-party manufacturers outweigh the potential benefits of operating its own manufacturing facilities. Even though the Company is now dependent on third-party manufacturers, it does not anticipate that this dependence will impact the quality of its products or its ability to deliver products to its customers on a timely basis. The Company continues to explore other sources for its products, both in China and elsewhere, to ensure that it remains competitive in the marketplace and reduce the potential adverse effect of the loss of one or more of its current third-party manufacturers or substantial changes in product costs. Further information concerning the restructuring changes, as applicable, that occurred in the Barry North America Group during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, the 2006 transition period and fiscal 2005 is presented in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. in this 2008 Form 10-K. Principal Products The Company is in the business of responding to consumer demand for comfortable footwear combined with attractive design, appearance and styling. Historically, the Companys primary products have been foam-soled, soft, washable slippers. In 1947, the Company developed and introduced womens Angel Treads*, the worlds first foam-soled, soft, washable slipper. Since that time, the Company has introduced several accessory footwear brand lines primarily for men and women that are designed to provide comfort to the consumer. These accessory footwear products are mostly sold under the Companys brand names including Angel Treads*, Dearfoams*, DFSport*, EZfeet*, Dearfoams NV*, My College Footwear, Snug Treds*, Soft Notes*, Solé, Terrasoles*, Utopia, and Soluna*, but products are also marketed and sold under trademarks the Company licenses from third parties. See the discussion under the caption Trademarks and Licenses below. The Company designs, markets and distributes accessory footwear products for women and men. The Companys products include slipper-type products and other types of products in the accessory footwear category, as defined earlier, including sandals and footwear products for indoor/outdoor wearing activities offered under the Terrasoles* brand name and canvas/active fashion footwear products offered under the Superga** brand name. The Company believes that many of its slipper-type products are ** Denotes a trademark of the licensor registered in the United States Department of Commerce Patent and Trademark Office. 5 Table of Contents purchased as gifts for others during the holiday selling season. Approximately 70% of the Companys annual consolidated net sales occur during the second half of the calendar year. The Companys foam-cushioned accessory footwear product collections continue to be a significant part of its core business. Several basic styles of slipper-type footwear are standard in many of the Companys brand lines and are in demand throughout the year. The most significant changes for these styles are made in response to fashion changes and include variations in design, ornamentation, fabric and/or color. The Company also regularly introduces new styles of accessory footwear products with a view toward enhancing the comfort, fashion appeal and freshness of its products. The introduction of new styles is traditionally part of its spring and fall collections of products. These products typically have uppers made of man made fibers such as microfiber suedes, terries and velours. In addition, corduroy, nylon and an updating assortment of other man made and natural materials may be used. The Company will continue to introduce new styles in future years in response to fashion changes, consumer taste and preferences. In January 2008, the Company entered into a three-year licensing agreement with Nautica Apparel, Inc. (Nautica Apparel), a subsidiary of VF Sportswear, Inc., a division of VF Corporation to become the exclusive licensee in North America, which includes primarily the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Nautica** is a leading global lifestyle brand. Under the licensing agreement with Nautica Apparel, the Company agreed to certain minimum royalty payments, payable quarterly. This licensing agreement establishes certain net sales targets that extend through December 31, 2010. If the Company meets the net sales target from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009, then the Company has the option to renew the licensing agreement for a period that extends through December 31, 2013. The Company believes that the Nautica** license is a natural extension of the Companys long-term growth strategy, which expands the collection of mens and womens product lines under the Companys current core business. Products under the Nautica** brand include a classic slipper fabrication and construction with uppers of natural and man made fibers including primarily suede, canvas and knit terry. The Company intends to distribute products under this brand primarily in upper tier department and specialty stores, beginning in the fall of calendar 2008. In August 2007, the Company launched a new collection of accessory footwear products under the Terrasoles* brand name. These products address the après activity needs of people engaged in or aspiring to a variety of indoor/outdoor activities and life styles while delivering comfort and quality. These products are eco-friendly and consist of upper materials that include recycled micro fleece and mesh, as well as organic materials such as bamboo. Other components of this brand, such as packaging materials, are likewise made of recycled or biodegradable materials and/or processed with a focus on being earth friendly. In June 2007, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with BasicNet S.p.A. of Turin, Italy, through BasicNets U.S. affiliate, Basic Properties America, Inc., (collectively, BasicNet) to become the exclusive licensee in the United States, and since July 2008 in Canada, for the Superga** brand of canvas/active fashion footwear. Superga** brand products include primarily vulcanized, sneaker-type footwear with canvas, linen and leather upper materials. Superga** is a leading European luxury brand in the canvas/active fashion footwear category. Under the licensing agreement with Superga**, the Company agreed to certain minimum royalty payments, payable quarterly, and to certain net sales targets that extend through December 31, 2010. If the Company meets the cumulative net sales target from July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009, then the Company has the option to renew the licensing agreement for a period that extends through December 31, 2013. The Company believes that the Superga** license is a significant component of the Companys long-term growth strategy and provides counter-balance to the seasonality of the Companys current core business. The Company began shipping products under the Superga** brand in December of 2007, achieving a modest revenue level at the end of fiscal 2008. 6 Table of Contents In May 2007, the Company signed a transfer agreement under which it purchased the NCAA College Clogs (College Clogs) product from Wolverine World Wide, Inc. This transfer agreement permitted the Company to sell the inventory it acquired from Wolverine World Wide, Inc. to a select number of customers. The Companys sales under the College Clogs brand were not significant in fiscal 2008. The transfer agreement did not include a transfer of the individual licenses with respect to the use of the logos of the NCAA colleges and universities. The Company believes that participation in the NCAA licensing program is consistent with the Companys long-term growth strategy, giving the Company an entry into the outdoor athletic sports channel. Therefore, as part of an initiative to re-brand the College Clogs products under the My College Footwear (MCF) label, the Company has applied for registration of the trademark MCF with the United States Department of Commerce Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the Company obtained licenses with the appropriate representatives of a select number of NCAA affiliated colleges and universities during fiscal 2008 to market products under the MCF brand. Products under the MCF brand include a more classic slipper-type fabrication and construction with uppers of man made fibers including primarily microfiber suedes, terries, velours, corduroy and nylon. The Company expects net sales of MCF products to be modest during fiscal 2009. Trademarks and Licenses Products sold under trademarks owned by the Company currently represent approximately 95% of the Companys annual net sales. The Company is the holder or licensee of a number of trademarks which identify its products, principally: Angel Treads*, Dearfoams*, EZfeet*, Dearfoams NV*, Snug Treds*, Soft Notes*, Solé, Terrasoles*, Utopia, Superga **, Nautica**, My College Footwear and Soluna*. The Company believes that its trademarks identify its products and have significant commercial value. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. The Company intends to continue the use of each of its trademarks and to renew each of its registered trademarks accordingly. The Company also sells accessory footwear under other trademarks owned by third parties under license agreements with such third parties. In fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, the 2006 transition period and fiscal 2005, total net sales under the Nautica**, Superga**, Liz Claiborne**, Claiborne**, Villager** and NASCAR** labels pursuant to the license agreements in effect represented approximately 1%, 3%, 19%, and 4% of the Companys consolidated net sales for the applicable reporting periods, respectively. Sales of these licensed products were proportionately higher during the 2006 transition period, when compared to the proportion of annual sales over the fiscal years noted, because of a new 2006 spring program with a key big box retailer launched in the spring of calendar 2006. The Company also markets accessory footwear to customers who sell the footwear under their own private labels. These sales represented approximately 10%, 12%, 9% and 2% of the Companys consolidated net sales during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, the 2006 transition period and fiscal 2005, respectively. Marketing The Companys marketing strategy for its slipper-type brand lines includes expanding counter and floor space by creating and marketing brand lines to different sectors of the consumer market. Retail prices for most of the Companys slipper-type products normally range from approximately $5 to $30 per pair, depending on the style of footwear, type of retail channel and retailers mark-up. Most consumers of the Companys slipper-type footwear products fit within a range of four to six sizes. This allows the Company to carry lower levels of inventories in the slipper lines compared to other more traditional footwear suppliers. 7 Table of Contents The Company primarily sells and markets its product through wholesale customer channels, but recent initiatives have included direct to consumer sales via Company Internet sites hosted via third party support. The Companys collections of slipper-type products are sold in the following channels of distribution:  Traditional department stores, promotional department stores, national chain department stores and specialty stores.  Mass merchandising channels of distribution such as discount stores, big box retailers, warehouse clubs, drug and variety chain of stores and supermarkets.  Independent retail establishments.  Catalogs and Internet. The Company believes that many consumers of its slipper-type products are loyal to the Companys brand lines and have a history of repeat purchases. Substantially all of the slipper-type and other product brand lines are or will be displayed on a self-selection basis and are intended to appeal to the impulse buyer as well as to the gift-giving buyer. The Companys products under the Terrasoles* brand are sold in specialty chain stores, independent shoe stores, department stores, retailer Internet sites, Company internet sites, outdoor type channels and catalogs. Prices of these products range from $49 to $59. Terrasoles* products are displayed on a self-selection basis and are intended to appeal primarily for the self-purchase buyer. Superga** products are sold in the shoe departments of mid-range and premier department stores, in better footwear stores and on Internet websites, at prices ranging from $80 to $180. The products under this brand are marketed primarily for the consumers self-purchase. Products sold under the MCF brand will be distributed, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, in sporting goods and athletic footwear channels, as well as in specialty chain stores, bookstores, catalogs and on Internet websites, at prices ranging from $19 to $49. The products under this brand are marketed primarily to the gift-giving buyer or for the consumers self-purchase. Channels of distribution for Terrasoles*, Superga** and MCF products are or will be, as applicable, channels in which the Company had no previous business presence. The Company expects net sales of products sold under these brands to be modest during fiscal 2009. Nautica** products are expected to be sold beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 in upper-tier department and specialty stores. Prices of these products will range from $36 to $48. Similar to the Companys other slipper brandlines, products sold under the Nautica** brand will be displayed on a self-selection basis and are intended to appeal to the impulse buyer as well as to the gift-giving buyer. The Company expects net sales under this brand to be modest in fiscal 2009. The Company has traditionally marketed most of its core products primarily through account managers employed by the Company. With the recent introduction of the Terrasoles*, Superga**, Nautica** and MCF brands, the Company has used and expects to continue to use independent sales representatives to market products under these brands. The Company does not finance its customers purchases, although return privileges are granted selectively to some of the Companys retailing partners. The Company in some cases will also grant allowances to its customers to fund advertising and in-season promotional activities. 8 Table of Contents During the spring and fall of each year, the Company presents a collection of designs and styles to buyers representing the Companys retail customers at scheduled showings. In an effort to achieve a broader market exposure, the Company also participates in a variety of regional and national trade shows throughout the year. In addition, the Companys account managers regularly visit retail customers and the Company makes catalogs available to its current and potential customers. The Company maintains a sales office and showroom in New York City. Buyers for department stores and other large retail customers periodically visit this sales office. The Company also maintains a sales administration office in Bentonville, Arkansas that supports the Companys business with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, Wal-Mart). During fiscal 2008, the Company was selected by Wal-Mart as their single resource for year-round basic replenishment slippers. This retailer previously bought these products from three suppliers of which we were the largest. The first phase of this major initiative involved selling inventory already in the retailers stores and warehouses to make way for fresh, new products. To accommodate this effort, the Company did not ship to this customer in November and December 2007 or January 2008. The Company resumed shipments to and restocking of their stores and distribution centers during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company for many years has hired temporary merchandisers to assist in the display and merchandising of the Companys products in a number of department stores and chain stores nationally. The Company believes that this point-of-sale management of the retail selling floor, combined with its computerized automatic demand-pull replenishment systems, optimizes over-the-counter sales. Net sales during the last six months of each calendar year have historically been greater than during the first six months. Consequently, the Companys inventory investment is largest in early fall in order to support its customers product needs and demands for the fall and holiday selling seasons. The Company advertises principally in print media, and most promotional efforts are often conducted in cooperation with its customers. Company products are displayed at the retail store level for self-selection or gift-purchase. The Company continues to focus on being consumer centric in its marketing initiatives. For instance, as Terrasoles* was launched to the consumer market place, the Company advertised this brand in Outside Magazine, Self, National Geographic Traveler and Alaskan Air. These targeted publications gave Terrasoles* the ability to reach the consumers most appropriate for this brand. Dearfoams* also continued its consumer campaign in the fall of 2007 with advertisements appearing in More and Oprah magazines. Additional direct to consumer initiatives undertaken during fiscal 2008 included brand sites with e-commerce capabilities for Dearfoams*, Superga** and Terrasoles*. These Internet sites allow the Company to have a community around the brands and speak to the consumers using these products. Other marketing initiatives undertaken during fiscal 2008 for each brand included public relations campaigns through editorials, gifting and celebrity dressing events. As the industry leader and accessory footwear category expert, the Company expects going forward to continue investing in a variety of initiatives involving consumer-oriented, marketing strategies that support its current and new brands. Research and Development Most of the Companys research and development activities relate to fabric selection, design and product testing. During fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, the 2006 transition period and fiscal 2005, the Company spent $2.6 million $2.4 million, $1.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, to support the research and design of new products and the improvement or redesign of existing products. These research and development activities were substantially supported by 13 employees engaged on a full-time basis in these activities. As part of its variable cost-based business model, the Company recently began utilizing a variety of outside design and development resources, primarily in support of its Terrasoles* branded 9 Table of Contents products, and expects to continue to do so in the future. Costs to be incurred with respect to this outsourcing of design and product development activities are not expected to be significant in proportion to the annual expenses incurred by the Company in this area. With respect to products branded under the Superga** name and as provided for in the related licensing agreement, BasicNet is responsible for all product development and design activities, including product fit and wear testing. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in the production of the Companys products are textile fabrics, threads, foams, other synthetic products, recycled micro fleece and mesh. These materials also include organic materials such as bamboo as well as packaging materials and are available from a wide range of suppliers. Thus far, the Companys third-party contract manufacturers have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials from their respective suppliers. Significant Customers Wal-Mart accounted for 37%, 33% and 35% of the Companys consolidated net sales during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the comparable 2006 fifty-two-week period, respectively. Most of the Companys sales to Wal-Mart are not seasonal in nature, as compared to the sales to the rest of Companys customers. J.C. Penney Company, Inc. accounted for 11% of the Companys consolidated net sales during each of the following reporting periods: fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the comparable 2006 fifty-two week period. In the event that either of these customers reduces or discontinues its product purchases, it would adversely affect the Companys results of operations. Seasonality and Backlog of Orders Approximately 70% of the Companys annual consolidated net sales are seasonal in nature and typically occur in the second half of the calendar year. The Companys backlog of unfilled sales orders is often largest in the July-August time frame of each calendar year as the Companys customer orders are received in preparation for the holiday selling season. The backlogs of unfilled orders as of August month-end periods that ended on September 2, 2008, September 1, 2007 and September 2, 2006 were $30.8 million, $28.0 million and $18.6 million, respectively. The backlogs of unfilled sales orders at the end of fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and the 2006 transition period were approximately $29.2 million, $9.7 million and $24.0 million, respectively. The Company anticipates that a large percentage of the unfilled sales orders as of the end of fiscal 2008 will be filled during the first six months of fiscal 2009. Due to the unpredictability of the timing of receipt of customer orders and given the heavy seasonality of the Companys sales, the Company believes that the status of the backlog of orders may not necessarily be indicative of future business. In recent years, customers have placed their orders much closer to the time of expected delivery. The Company expects that this current trend will continue in the future. The Companys internal product sourcing and logistics activities will continue to adapt to this trend to ensure complete and timely deliveries to its customers. Inventory The Company plans to continue introducing new updated styles to enhance the comfort, freshness and fashion appeal of its products. The Company anticipates that many of the styles will change from season to season, particularly in response to fashion and design changes, as well as in response to retailers requests for product differentiation. Given these circumstances, a key strategic Company objective is to better manage its exposure to obsolete inventory. Under the current business model, the Company has been successful in maintaining lower inventory levels, reducing its inventory risks, and lowering the amount of inventory write-downs. A key tactical objective of the Companys supply chain 10 Table of Contents management is to purchase inventory closer to the time that it is needed by the customer and more in line with the visibility of consumer demand. The Company expects to consistently follow this business practice in the future for all product lines. The decrease in inventory levels from the end of fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was due to the following: the increase in shipments at the end of fiscal 2008; the reduction in inventory due to the April 10, 2008 storm that struck our distribution center in Texas; the continued efforts to improve the timing of purchases versus shipments; and the increasing turnover on slow-moving and closeout inventories. The decrease in inventory also reflected the Companys continued success in collaborating closely with its key retaining partners to liquidate inventory in season and aggressively sell its close out inventories. The Company believes that its exposure to obsolete inventory in fiscal 2009 will likely continue to trend downward. Sourcing The Company maintains an office in Hong Kong to facilitate the procurement of slipper-type products and products to be sold under its various brands, excluding Superga**. The Company currently purchases its slipper-type products from ten different third-party manufacturers, all of which are located in China. Purchases of products sold under the Terrasoles* brand are made from third-party manufacturers different from those the Company uses for slipper-type products. All third-party manufacturers of Terrasoles* products are located in China. The Company expects to purchase products for the MCF brand from its slipper third-party manufacturers. Purchases of Superga** products are made from BasicNets supplier base. These suppliers are located primarily in Vietnam. As provided for in the agreement with Superga,** BasicNet is responsible for ensuring that the factories comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the third-party manufacturing of Superga** products. The Company will rely on BasicNets experience in dealing with these suppliers and expects the quality and delivery of products purchased from these suppliers to be consistent with the Companys overall established quality standards. The Companys experience with its third-party manufacturers has been very good in terms of reliability, delivery times and product quality. The Company recognizes, however, that its reliance on third-party manufacturers does create additional risk to the Companys business because it no longer controls the manufacturing process of its products. This lack of control could impact the quality of its products and the Companys ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely basis. During fiscal 2008, the Company did not experience any substantial adverse quality or timeliness issues. The increase in the volume of goods sourced from independent third-party manufacturers in China since the beginning of fiscal 2005 and the Companys dependence on these manufacturers has resulted in additional responsibilities for the Companys sourcing operations, including its office in Hong Kong. The Company will continue to ensure that the sourcing activities supported by the Hong Kong office are effectively aligned to ensure that the quality and delivery of products complies with the Companys standards. Competition The Company primarily operates in a relatively small segment of the overall accessory footwear retail industry. The Company competes primarily on the basis of price, value, quality and comfort of its products, service to its customers and its marketing and merchandising expertise. The Company believes it is among the worlds largest marketers of accessory footwear products; however, this category is a very small component of the highly competitive footwear industry. In recent years, companies that are engaged in other areas of the footwear industry and apparel companies have begun to market accessory footwear. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution and marketing resources than the Company. In addition, many of the retail customers for our products have sought to import competitive products directly from manufacturers in China and elsewhere for sale in their stores 11 Table of Contents on a private label basis. The Company is not aware of any reliable published statistics that indicate its current market-share position in the footwear industry or in the sector of the footwear industry providing accessory footwear products. Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution Facilities Since fiscal 2004, the Company has not operated or owned any manufacturing facilities in North America. In addition to its corporate headquarters in Pickerington, Ohio, the Company maintains sales and sales administration offices in New York City and Bentonville, Arkansas and a sourcing representative office in Hong Kong. During fiscal 2008, the Company relied on its distribution center in San Angelo, Texas and used an independent third-party logistics provider located on the West Coast of the United States to store products, fulfill customer orders and distribute products to its customers. The distribution center in Texas primarily supports shipments of replenishment, closeout product and e-commerce customer orders. The third-party logistics provider primarily supports case pack shipments to customers. The Companys principal administrative, sales and distribution facilities are described more fully below under 
