Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our markets are highly competitive and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by entry of new competitors into the markets, aggressive pricing, and the introduction or expansion of competitive products and technologies. The markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological advances, price erosion, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards. We expect that our markets will continue to attract new competition. Our current and potential competition consists of major domestic and international companies, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, and distribution resources than we have. Additional companies, including but not limited to our suppliers, strategic partners, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers, and emerging companies, may enter the markets for our storage networking products and new or stronger competitors may emerge as a result of consolidation movements in the marketplace. Additionally, our existing competitors continue to introduce products with improved price/performance characteristics, and we may have to do the same to remain competitive. Furthermore, competitors may introduce new products to the market before we do, and thus obtain a first to market advantage over us. Increased competition could result in increased price competition, reduced revenues, lower profit margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A downturn in information technology spending in general, or spending on computer and storage systems in particular, could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The demand for our network storage products has been driven by the demand for high performance storage networking products and solutions that support enterprise computing applications, including on-line transaction processing, data mining, data warehousing, multimedia, and Internet applications. Any significant downturn in demand for such products, solutions, and applications could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The adverse effects of any sustained downturn in information technology spending on our operating results may be exacerbated by our research and development investments, strategic investments and merger and acquisition activity, as well as customer service and support, which are expected to continue despite any such downturn. 11 Table of Contents A significant portion of our business depends upon the continued growth of the storage networking market, and our business will be adversely affected if such growth does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate. The size of our potential market is largely dependent on the overall demand for storage in general and in particular upon the broadening acceptance of our storage networking technologies. We believe that our investment in multi protocol solutions that address the high performance needs of the storage networking market provides the greatest opportunity for our revenue growth and profitability for the future. However, the market for storage networking products may not gain broader acceptance and customers may choose alternative technologies that we are not investing in, and/or products supplied by other companies. Interest continues for other storage networking technologies such as Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI), which may satisfy some I/O connectivity requirements through standard Ethernet adapters and software at little to no incremental cost to end users, or through iSCSI Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) that provide bundled offload engine hardware and software. Such iSCSI solutions compete with our Host Server Products, particularly in the low end of the market. We have announced plans to provide Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol products. Such products are planned for sale to the same customers who purchase Fibre Channel HBAs and mezzanine cards from us. It is possible that customers will purchase converged Ethernet systems using FCoE products instead of systems using our Fibre Channel HBAs. In addition, other technologies such as PBCs and serial attached SCSI (SAS) compete with our embedded storage products today, and we may not be able to develop products fast enough, or cost effective enough to compete in this market. Furthermore, since our products are sold as parts of integrated systems, demand for our products is driven by the demand for these integrated systems, including other companies complementary products. A lack of demand for the integrated systems or a lack of complementary products required for these integrated systems to be deployed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If the storage networking market does not grow, or grows more slowly than we anticipate, attracts more competitors than we expect, as discussed below, or if our products do not achieve continued market acceptance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Because a significant portion of our revenues is generated from sales to a limited number of customers, none of which are the subject of exclusive or long-term contracts, the loss of one or more of these customers, or our customers failure to make timely payments to us, could adversely affect our business. We rely almost exclusively on OEMs and sales through distribution channels for our revenue. For the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008, we derived approximately 75% of our net revenues from sales to OEM customers and approximately 25% from sales through distribution. Furthermore, as some of our sales through distribution channels consist of OEM products, OEM customers effectively generated approximately 90% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008. We may be unable to retain our current OEM and distributor customers or to recruit additional or replacement customers. Although we have attempted to expand our base of customers, including customers for embedded storage products, we believe our revenues in the future will continue to be similarly derived from a limited number of customers. As a result, to the extent that sales to any of our significant customers do not increase in accordance with our expectations or are reduced or delayed, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. As is common in the technology industry, our agreements with OEMs and distributors are typically non-exclusive, have no volume commitments, and often may be terminated by either party without cause. It is increasingly commonplace for our OEM and distributor customers to utilize or carry competing product lines. If we were to lose business from one or more significant OEM or distributor customers to a competitor, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our OEMs may elect to change their business practices in ways that affect the timing of our revenues, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents Our operating results are difficult to forecast and could be adversely affected by many factors, and our stock price may decline if our results fail to meet expectations. Our revenues and results of operations have varied on a quarterly basis in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, and you should not rely on such comparisons as indications of our future performance. We may be unable to maintain our current levels of growth or profitability in the future. Our revenues and results of operations are difficult to forecast and could be adversely affected by many factors, including, but not limited to:  changes in the size, mix, timing and terms of OEM and/or other customer orders;  changes in the sales and deployment cycles for our products and/or desired inventory levels for our products;  acquisitions or strategic investments by our customers, competitors or us;  timing and market acceptance of new or enhanced product introductions by us, our OEM customers and/or competitors;  market share losses or difficulty in gaining incremental market share;  fluctuations in product development, procurement, resource utilization and other operating expenses;  component shortages;  reduced demand from our customers if there is a shortage of, or difficulties in acquiring, components or other products, such as Fibre Channel or serial advanced technology attachment (SATA) disk drives and optical modules, used in conjunction with our products in the deployment of systems;  inability of our electronics manufacturing service providers to produce and distribute our products in a timely fashion;  difficulties with updates, changes or additions to our information technology systems;  breaches of our network security, including viruses;  changes in general social and economic conditions, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorism, public health crises, slower than expected market growth, reduced economic activity, delayed economic recovery, loss of consumer confidence, increased energy costs, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns, concerns about inflation or deflation, recession, and reduced business profits and capital spending, with resulting changes in customer technology budgeting and spending;  changes in technology, industry standards or consumer preferences;  seasonality;  changes in our effective tax rate; and  changes in our accounting or other policies resulting from the adoption of new laws, regulations or pronouncements. As a result of these and other unexpected factors or developments, future operating results may be from time to time below the expectations of investors or market analysts, which would have a material adverse effect on our stock price. 13 Table of Contents Our relatively small backlog of unfilled orders, possible customer delays or deferrals and our tendency to generate a large percentage of our quarterly sales near the end of the quarter contribute to possible fluctuations in our operating results that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and stock price. Historically, we have generally shipped products quickly after we receive orders, meaning that we do not always have a significant backlog of unfilled orders, in particular for our HBA products. As a result, our revenues in a given quarter may depend substantially on orders booked during that quarter. Alternatively, orders already in backlog may be deferred or cancelled. Also, we have typically generated a large percentage of our quarterly revenues in the last month of the quarter. As a result of our expense levels being largely based on our expectations of future sales and continued investment in research and development, in the event we experience unexpected decreases in sales, our expenses may be disproportionately large relative to our revenues, and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. A material shortfall in sales in relation to our quarterly expectations or any delay, deferral, or cancellation of customer orders would likely have an immediate and adverse impact on our results of operations and may adversely affect our stock price. Our industry is subject to rapid technological change and we must keep pace with the changes to successfully compete. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and the frequent introduction of new products and enhancements. Our future success depends in large part on our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new products on a timely basis to meet changes in customer preferences and evolving industry standards. Currently, new and proposed technologies such as eight, 10, and 16Gb/s Fibre Channel solutions; Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE); Enhanced Ethernet; 10Gb/s Ethernet solutions; low latency Ethernet solutions; Data Center Ethernet; Infiniband; iSCSI; PCI-X 2.0; PCI Express Gen one, two, and three; PCI Express Advanced Switching; SATA; SAS; and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA); are in development by many companies and their ultimate acceptance and deployment in the market is uncertain. We are developing some, but not all of these technologies, and we cannot be sure that the technologies we chose to develop will achieve market acceptance, or that technologies that we chose not to develop will be available to purchase or license from third parties or will be immaterial to our business. Furthermore, if our products are not available in time for the qualification cycle at an OEM, it may be up to three years or more (if ever), before another qualification cycle is available to us. In addition, new products and enhancements developed by us may not be backwards compatible to existing equipment already installed in the market. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop new products, enhance or sell existing products, or consume raw materials in a timely and cost effective manner in response to technological and market changes, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The migration of our customers toward newer product platforms may have a significant adverse effect. As our customers migrate from one platform to the enhanced price/performance of the next platform, we may experience reduced revenue, gross profit, or gross margin levels associated with lower average selling prices or higher relative product costs associated with improved performance. While we regularly compare forecasted demand for our products against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments, to the extent that customers migrate more quickly than anticipated, the corresponding reduction in demand for older product platforms may result in excess or obsolete inventory and related charges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The migration of our customers from purchasing our products through the distribution channel and toward OEM server manufacturers may have a significant adverse effect. As our customers migrate from purchasing our products through the distribution channel and toward purchasing our products through OEM server manufacturers, which has a lower average selling price, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 14 Table of Contents Any failure of our OEM customers to keep up with rapid technological change and successfully market and sell systems that incorporate new technologies could adversely affect our business. Our revenues depend significantly upon the ability and willingness of our OEM customers to commit significant resources to develop, promote, and deliver products that incorporate our technology. In addition, if our customers products are not commercially successful, it would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Rapid changes in the evolution of technology, including the unexpected extent or timing of the transition from HBA solutions or embedded switch box solutions to lower priced ASIC solutions, could adversely affect our business. Historically, the electronics industry has developed higher performance application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that create chip level solutions that replace selected board level or box level solutions at a significantly lower average selling price. We have previously experienced this trend and expect it to continue in the future. If this transition is more abrupt or is more widespread than anticipated, there can be no assurance that we will be able to modify our business model in a timely manner, if at all, in order to mitigate the effects of this transition on our business, results of operations, and financial position. If customers elect to utilize lower end HBAs in higher-end environments or applications, our business and financial condition could be negatively affected. We supply three families of HBAs that target separate high-end, midrange and small to medium sized business user (SMB) markets. Historically, the majority of our storage networking revenue has come from our high-end server and storage solutions. In the future, increased revenues are expected to come from dual channel adapters, midrange server, and storage solutions, which have lower average selling prices per port. If customers elect to utilize midrange HBAs in higher-end environments or applications, or migrate to dual channel adapters faster than we anticipate, our business and financial condition could be negatively affected. Advancement of storage device capacity technology may not allow for additional revenue growth. Storage device density continues to improve rapidly and at some point in the future, the industry may experience a period where the increase in storage device capacity may equal or exceed the growth rate of digital data. This would result in a situation where the number of units of storage devices may flatten out or even decrease. Our growth in revenue depends on growth in unit shipments to offset declining average selling prices. To the extent that growth in storage device unit demand slows or decreases, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. A decrease in the average unit selling prices and/or an increase in the manufactured cost of our products due to inflation or other factors could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and financial performance. In the past, we have experienced downward pressure on the average unit selling prices of our products, and we expect this trend to continue. Furthermore, we may provide pricing discounts to customers based upon volume purchase criteria, and achievement of such discounts may reduce our average unit selling prices. To the extent that growth in unit demand fails to offset decreases in average unit selling prices, our revenues and financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Although historically we have achieved offsetting cost reductions, to the extent that average unit selling prices of our products decrease without a corresponding decrease in the costs of such products, our gross margins and financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins could also be adversely affected by a shift in the mix of product sales to lower gross margin products. Furthermore, as our products are manufactured internationally, cost reductions would be more difficult to achieve if the value of the U.S. dollar continues to deteriorate. Moreover, if the manufactured cost of our products were to increase due to inflation or other factors and we cannot pass along the increase in our costs to our customers, our gross margins and financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 15 Table of Contents Delays in product development could adversely affect our business. We have experienced delays in product development in the past and may experience similar delays in the future. Prior delays have resulted from numerous factors, which may include, but are not limited to:  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary employees and independent contractors;  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and other resource limitations;  unanticipated engineering or manufacturing complexity, including from third party suppliers of intellectual property such as foundries of our ASICs;  undetected errors or failures in our products;  changing OEM product specifications;  delays in the acceptance or shipment of products by OEM customers; and  changing market or competitive product requirements. Given the short product life cycles in the markets for our products and the relatively long product development cycles, any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our joint development activities may result in products that are not commercially successful or that are not available in a timely fashion. We have engaged in joint development projects with third parties in the past and we expect to continue doing so in the future. Joint development can magnify several risks for us, including the loss of control over development of aspects of the jointly developed products and over the timing of product availability. Accordingly, we face increased risk that joint development activities will result in products that are not commercially successful or that are not available in a timely fashion. Any failure to timely develop commercially successful products through our joint development activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A change in our business relationships with our third party suppliers or our electronics manufacturing service providers could adversely affect our business. We rely on third party suppliers for components and the manufacture of our products, and we have experienced delays or difficulty in securing components and finished goods in the past. Delays or difficulty in securing components or finished goods at reasonable cost may be caused by numerous factors including, but not limited to:  discontinued production by a supplier;  required long-term purchase commitments;  undetected errors, failures or production quality issues, including projected failures that may exceed epidemic failure rates specified in agreements with our customers or that may require us to make concessions or accommodations for continuing customer relationships;  timeliness of product delivery;  sole sourcing and components made by a small number of suppliers, including the inability to obtain components and finished goods at reasonable cost from such sources and suppliers;  financial stability and viability of our suppliers and electronics manufacturing service (EMS) providers;  changes in business strategies of our suppliers and EMS providers; 16 Table of Contents  increases in manufacturing costs due to lower volumes or more complex manufacturing process than anticipated;  disruption in shipping channels;  natural disasters;  inability or unwillingness of our suppliers or EMS providers to continue their business with us;  environmental, tax or legislative changes in the location where our products are produced or delivered;  difficulties associated with international operations; and  market shortages. There is a risk that we will not be able to retain our current suppliers or change to alternative suppliers. An interruption in supply, the cost of shifting to a new supplier or EMS providers, disputes with suppliers or EMS providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As we have transitioned the material procurement and management for our key components used in our board or box level products to our EMS providers, we face increasing risks associated with ensuring product availability. Further, an adverse inventory management control issue by one or more of our third party suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also purchase ASIC components from sole source suppliers, including LSI Corporation, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., and Intel Corporation, who in turn rely on a limited number of their suppliers to manufacture ASICs, all of which create risks in assuring such component availability. If our intellectual property protections are inadequate, it could adversely affect our business. We believe that our continued success depends primarily on continuing innovation, marketing, and technical expertise, as well as the quality of product support and customer relations. At the same time, our success is partially dependent on the proprietary technology contained in our products. We currently rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our proprietary rights, that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology, or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured, or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or at all. Furthermore, we enter into various development projects and arrangements with other companies. In some cases, these arrangements allow for the sharing or use of our intellectual property. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We attempt to mitigate this risk by obtaining indemnification from others, where possible. Certain of our software (as well as that of our customers) may be derived from so-called open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Such open source software is often made available to us under licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public, and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of licenses customarily used to protect our intellectual property. In the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work. 17 Table of Contents Third party claims of intellectual property infringement could adversely affect our business. We believe that our products and technology do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others or upon intellectual property rights that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending applications. We occasionally receive communications from third parties alleging patent infringement, and there is always the chance that third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Any such claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may or may not be available. Furthermore, we have in the past obtained, and may be required in the future to obtain, licenses of technology owned by other parties. We cannot be certain that the necessary licenses will be available or that they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we were to fail to obtain such royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Ongoing lawsuits present inherent risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Such potential risks include the continuing expenses of litigation, the risk of loss of patent rights, the risk of injunction against the sale of products incorporating the technology in question, counterclaims, attorneys fee liability, and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters. The inability or increased cost of attracting, motivating, or retaining key managerial and technical personnel could adversely affect our business. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the performance and continued service of key managers, as well as engineers involved in the development of our storage networking technologies and technical support of our storage networking products and customers. Competition for such highly skilled employees in the communities in which we operate, as well as our industry, is intense, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in recruiting, training, and retaining such personnel. In addition, employees may leave us and subsequently compete against us, and there may be costs relating to their departure. Also, many of these key managerial and technical personnel receive stock options or unvested stock as part of our employee retention initiatives. The number of shares authorized under stock based plans may be insufficient and shareholders may not approve to increase the number of authorized shares. New regulations, volatility in the stock market, and other factors could diminish the value of our stock options or unvested stock, putting us at a competitive disadvantage and forcing us to use more cash compensation. If we are unable to attract new managerial and technical employees, or are unable to retain and motivate our current key managerial and technical employees, or are forced to use more cash compensation to retain or replace key personnel, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our international business activities subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business. For the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008, sales in the United States accounted for approximately 40% our total net revenues, sales in the Pacific Rim countries accounted for approximately 26%, and sales in Europe and the rest of the world accounted for approximately 34% of our total net revenues, based on billed-to address. We expect that our sales will be similarly distributed for the foreseeable future. However, because we sell to OEMs and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers, the geographic mix of our sales may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end-user demand or installations. All of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, our products could become less competitive in international markets. In addition, an increasing amount of our expenses will be incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars and as a result, we will be required from time to time to convert currencies to meet our obligations. Additionally, our suppliers are increasingly located outside the U.S., and a significant portion of our products is produced at our EMS providers production facilities in Mexico, Thailand, and Malaysia. Furthermore, in connection with the reorganization of our international subsidiaries, we established a company in Ireland, and a significant portion of our sales and operations will now also occur in countries outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to 18 Table of Contents the risks inherent in international operations. Our international business activities could be affected, limited or disrupted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:  imposition of or changes in governmental controls, taxes, tariffs, trade restrictions, and regulatory requirements to our current or future operations;  costs and risks of localizing products for international countries;  longer accounts receivable payment cycles;  changes in the value of local currencies relative to our functional currency;  fluctuations in freight costs and potential disruptions in the transportation infrastructure for our products and components;  import and export restrictions;  loss of tax benefits or increases in tax expenses;  general economic and social conditions within international countries;  taxation in multiple jurisdictions;  difficulty maintaining management oversight and control of remote locations;  potential restrictions on transferring funds between countries and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held outside of the U.S. in a tax-efficient manner;  the increased travel, infrastructure, accounting, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations; and  political instability, war, or terrorism. All of these factors could harm future sales of our products to international customers or production outside of the United States of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Potential acquisitions or strategic investments may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. We may pursue acquisitions or strategic investments that could provide new technologies, products, or service offerings. Future acquisitions or strategic investments may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of operating losses incurred by the acquired entity, the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, incurrence of debt, amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives, or impairment of intangible assets. Furthermore, we may incur significant expenses pursuing acquisitions or strategic investments that ultimately may not be completed. Moreover, to the extent that any proposed acquisition or strategic investment that is not favorably received by stockholders, analysts and others in the investment community, the price of our stock could be adversely affected. In addition, acquisitions or strategic investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired company;  purchased technology that is not adopted by customers in the way or the time frame we anticipated;  diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;  risks associated with assuming the legal obligations of the acquired company; 19 Table of Contents  minority interest in a company, resulting from a strategic investment, that could have an impact on our results;  risks related to the effect that the acquired companys internal control processes might have on our financial reporting and managements report on our internal controls over financial reporting;  potential loss of key employees of the company we invested in or acquired;  risks related to companies we invest in not being able to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings, or to take advantage of liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales;  there may exist unknown defects of an acquired companys products or assets that may not be identified due to the inherent limitations involved in the due diligence process of an acquisition; and  changes in generally accepted accounting principles regarding the accounting treatment for acquisitions to less favorable treatment than is currently allowed. In the event that an acquisition or strategic investment does occur and we are unable to obtain anticipated profits or successfully integrate operations, technologies, products, or personnel or acquire assets that later become worthless, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our stock price is volatile, which has and may result in lawsuits against us and our officers and directors. The stock market in general and the stock prices in technology based companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well. For example, during the first six months of calendar year 2008, the closing sales price of our common stock ranged from a low of $11.83 per share to a high of $16.83 per share. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, but are not limited to, the following:  quarterly variations in customer demand and operating results;  announcements of new products by us or our competitors;  the gain or loss of significant customers or design wins;  changes in analysts earnings estimates;  changes in analyst recommendations, price targets, or other parameters that may not be related to earnings estimates;  rumors or dissemination of false information;  pricing pressures;  short selling of our common stock;  general conditions in the computer, storage, or communications markets; and  events affecting other companies that investors deem to be comparable to us. In the past, companies, including us, that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. If we were to be the subject of similar litigation in the future or experience unfavorable outcomes in any of our pending litigation, as discussed in Note 10 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such litigation would also divert managements attention from other business matters. 20 Table of Contents Terrorist activities and resulting military and other actions could adversely affect our business. The continued threat of terrorism, military action, and heightened security measures in response to the threat of terrorism may cause significant disruption to commerce in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. Additionally, it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such events by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, delays in collecting cash, a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology, or our inability to effectively market, manufacture, or ship our products, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our corporate offices and principal product development facilities are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Our California and Washington facilities, including our corporate offices and principal product development facilities, are located near major earthquake faults. Any disruption in our business activities, personal injury, or damage to the facilities in excess of our currently insured amounts as a result of earthquakes or other such natural disasters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We currently do not carry earthquake insurance. However, we do carry various other lines of insurance that may or may not be adequate to protect our business. Our shareholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could adversely affect the performance of our stock. Our shareholder rights plan, provisions of our certificate of incorporation, and Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. The shareholder rights plan, provisions of our certificate of incorporation, and Delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing shareholder value. However, such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Our system of internal controls may be inadequate. We maintain a system of internal controls in order to ensure we are able to collect, process, summarize, and disclose the information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission within the time periods specified. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Due to these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Additionally, public companies in the United States are required to review their internal controls under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If the internal controls put in place by us are not adequate or fail to perform as anticipated, we may be required to restate our financial statements, receive an adverse audit opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and/or take other actions that will divert significant financial and managerial resources, as well as be subject to fines and/or other government enforcement actions. Furthermore, the price of our stock could be adversely affected. 21 Table of Contents Changes in laws, regulations, and financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations. New laws, regulations and accounting standards, as well as changes to and varying interpretations of currently accepted accounting practices in the technology industry might adversely affect our reported financial results, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. The final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, our calculations of income taxes are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. We have adopted transfer-pricing procedures between our subsidiaries to regulate intercompany transfers. Our procedures call for the licensing of intellectual property, the provision of services, and the sale of products from one subsidiary to another at prices that we believe are equivalent to arms length negotiated pricing. We have established these procedures due to the fact that some of our assets, such as intellectual property, developed in the U.S., will be transferred among other affiliated companies. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully require changes to our transfer pricing practices, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected. Any determination of income reallocation or modification of transfer pricing laws can result in an income tax assessment on the portion of income deemed to be derived from the U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of new legislation, an audit or litigation, or determined in connection with finalization of our tax returns, or if our effective tax rate should change as a result of changes in federal, international or state and local tax laws or their interpretations, or if we were to change the locations where we operate or if we elect or are required to transfer funds between jurisdictions, there could be a material adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods in which that determination is made, and potentially to future periods as well. We may need additional capital in the future and such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms. While we believe we have adequate working capital to meet our expected cash requirements for the next 12 months, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to, without limitation:  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, including more rapid international expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies;  develop new products or services;  repay outstanding indebtedness; and  respond to unanticipated competitive pressures. Any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities, develop new products or services, or otherwise respond to unanticipated competitive pressures. In any such case, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 22 Table of Contents Global warming issues may cause us to alter the way we conduct our business. The general public is becoming more aware of global warming issues and as a result, governments around the world are beginning to focus on addressing this issue. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers, and our customers in how we conduct our business including the design, development, and manufacturing of our products. The cost of meeting these requirements may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
