Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating our business and financial condition. Although the risks described below are risks that we face in our business that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware or that we may view as immaterial based on the information currently available to us that may prove to be material in the future. There can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, such developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Our business is dependent on obtaining work through a competitive bidding process. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Most of our products and services, including the Insituform® CIPP process, face direct competition from companies offering similar or essentially equivalent products or services. In addition, customers can select a variety of methods to meet their pipe installation and rehabilitation, coating and cathodic protection needs, including a number of methods that we do not offer. Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, and we face challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. 11 Table of Contents We may experience cost overruns on our projects. We typically conduct our business under guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts, where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability of materials and other exigencies. Our profitability depends heavily on our ability to make accurate estimates. Inaccurate estimates, or changes in other circumstances, such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials or our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform could result in substantial losses, as such changes adversely affect the revenue and gross profit recognized on each project. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods. Our use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded results. We employ the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for our construction projects. This methodology recognizes revenues and profits over the life of a project based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated project costs. Revisions to revenues and profits are made once amounts are known and/or can be reasonably estimated. Given the uncertainties associated with some of our contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made. Revisions to estimates could result in the reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized. Our success and growth strategy depends on our senior management and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We depend on our senior management for the success and future growth of the operations and revenues of our Company, and the loss of any member of our senior management could have an adverse impact on our operations. Such a loss may be a distraction to senior management as we search for a qualified replacement, could result in significant recruiting, relocation, training and other costs and could cause operational inefficiencies as a replacement becomes familiar with our business and operations. In addition, we use a multi-level sales force structured around target markets and key accounts, focusing on marketing our products and services to engineers, consultants, administrators, technical staff and elected officials; we are dependent on our personnel to continue to develop improvements to our proprietary processes, including materials used and the methods of manufacturing, installation, coating and cathodic protection; and we require quality field personnel to effectively and profitably perform our work. Our success in attracting and retaining qualified personnel is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and the impact on the labor supply of general economic conditions, as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment. Our failure to attract, train, integrate and retain qualified personnel could have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our recognition of revenues from change orders, extra work or variations in the scope of work could be subject to reversal in future periods. We recognize revenues from change orders, extra work or variations in the scope of work as set forth in our written contracts with our clients when management believes that realization of these revenues is probable and the recoverable amounts can be reasonably estimated. Prior to our decision to recognize these revenues, we consult with legal counsel to determine the likelihood of recovery and the amount of the recovery that can be estimated. We also factor in all other information that we possess with respect to the claim to determine whether the claim should be recognized at all and, if recognition is appropriate, what dollar amount of the claim should be recognized. Due to factors that we may not anticipate at the time of recognition, however, revenues ultimately received on these claims could be less than revenues that we recognized in a prior reporting period or periods, which could require us in subsequent reporting periods to reduce or reverse revenues and gross profit previously recognized. 12 Table of Contents Extreme weather conditions may adversely affect our operations. We are likely to be impacted by weather extremes, such as excessive rain or hurricanes, typhoons, snow and ice or frigid temperatures, which may cause temporary, short-term anomalies in our operational performance in certain localized geographic regions. Although we can make no assurances as to the future, historically, these impacts have not been material to our operations as a whole. Delays and other weather impacts could adversely affect our ability to meet project deadlines and may increase a projects cost and decrease its profitability. Certain of our Bayou facilities are located in a region that may be affected by natural disasters. Certain of our Bayou facilities are located on the Gulf Coast in Louisiana. This region is subject to increased hurricane activity that can result in substantial flooding. Our Bayou facilities have in the past experienced damage due to floods. Although we maintain flood loss insurance where necessary, a hurricane, flood or other natural disaster could result in significant damage to our facilities, recovery costs and interruption to certain of our operations. We may be liable to complete the work of our joint venture partners under our joint venture arrangements. We enter into contractual joint ventures in order to develop joint bids on certain contracts. The success of these joint ventures depends largely on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their obligations under the joint venture. Under these joint venture arrangements, we may be required to complete our joint venture partners portion of the contract if the partner is unable to complete its portion and a bond is not available. In such case, the additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture. A substantial portion of our raw materials is from a limited number of vendors, and we are subject to market fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities. We purchase the majority of our fiber requirements for tube manufacturing from two sources. We believe, however, that alternate sources are readily available, and we continue to negotiate with other supply sources. The manufacture of the tubes used in our rehabilitation business is dependent upon the availability of resin, a petroleum-based product. We currently have qualified four resin suppliers from which we intend to purchase the majority of our resin requirements for our North American operations. For our European operations, we currently have qualified four resin suppliers and are in the process of qualifying additional suppliers. We believe that these and other sources of resin supply are readily available. Historically, resin prices have fluctuated on the basis of the prevailing prices of oil, and we anticipate that prices will continue to be heavily influenced by the events affecting the oil market. The primary products and raw materials used by our Corrpro operations include zinc, aluminum, magnesium and other metallic anodes, as well as wire and cable. We believe that Corrpro has multiple sources available for these raw materials and is not dependent on any single vendor to meet its supply needs. The prices of these raw materials have historically been affected by the prices of energy, petroleum, steel and other commodities, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency and exchange rates. A significant increase in the prices of these raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we purchase a significant volume of fuel to operate our trucks and equipment. At present, we do not engage in any type of hedging activities to mitigate the risks of fluctuating market prices for oil or fuel. A significant increase in the price of oil could cause an adverse effect on our cost structure that we may not be able to recover from our customers. International trade tariffs and restrictions in the steel market may adversely affect our Bayou business. The business of our subsidiary, Bayou, is heavily dependent on providing products and services to customers that import steel pipe into the United States from the international markets. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of, steel pipe imported into the United States, the demand from Bayous customers for Bayous products and services will be diminished, which will adversely affect Bayous revenues and profitability. Our business depends upon the maintenance of our proprietary technologies and information. We depend upon our proprietary technologies and information, most of which are no longer subject to patent protection. We rely principally upon trade secret and copyright laws to protect our proprietary technologies. We regularly enter into confidentiality agreements with our key employees, customers and potential customers and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to assure that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, the laws of other countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. 13 Table of Contents We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants under our senior notes and line of credit facility. At December 31, 2009, we had $65.0 million in senior notes outstanding due April 2013. On March 31, 2009, we entered into a $115.0 million credit facility with a lending syndicate headed by Bank of America, N.A., which expires on March 31, 2012. The credit facility consists of a $65.0 million revolving line of credit and a $50.0 million three-year term loan. The entire amount of the term loan was drawn on March 31, 2009, in connection with our acquisition of Corrpro. At December 31, 2009, $42.5 million of the term loan was outstanding. At December 31, 2009, we had $22.5 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding and no other outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Our senior notes and our line of credit facility contain certain restrictive debt covenants and other customary events of default. These covenants limit the amount and type of debt we can incur and fixed charges as a measure of operating cash flow. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the factors described in this Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors outside our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as required under the senior notes and credit facility. If we are unable to comply with the restrictive covenants in the future, we would be required to obtain amendments or waivers from our lenders or secure another source of financing. If our current lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis. In addition, these restrictive covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our senior notes can be repaid at any time at par value plus a make-whole payment. The make-whole payment is calculated as the present value of the principal and remaining interest payments discounted at a reinvestment rate equal to the yield on the United States Treasury security with a maturity equal to the average life to maturity plus 50 basis points. At December 31, 2009, this make-whole payment would have approximated $7.7 million. Our sewer and water rehabilitation revenues are substantially dependent on municipal government spending. Many of our customers are municipal governmental agencies, and as such, we are dependent on municipal spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints and other factors. Consequently, future municipal spending may not be allocated to projects that would benefit our business or may not be allocated in the amounts or for the size of the projects that we anticipated. A decrease in municipal spending on such projects would adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. Cyclical downturns in the mining, oil and natural gas industries, or in the oilfield and mining services businesses, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The mining, oil and natural gas industries are highly cyclical. Demand for the majority of our oilfield and mining products and services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the mining, oil and natural gas industries for the exploration, development and production of mined minerals, crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to the prices of these commodities and generally dependent on the industrys view of future mined mineral, oil and natural gas prices. There are numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for our products and services, which include, but are not limited to:  market prices of mined minerals, oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices;  cost of producing mined minerals, oil and natural gas;  the level of mining, drilling and production activity;  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;  mergers, consolidations and downsizing among our clients;  coordination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);  the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients;  financial condition of our client base and their ability to fund capital and maintenance expenditures;  adverse weather conditions;  civil unrest in oil-producing countries;  level of consumption of minerals, oil, natural gas and petrochemicals by consumers; and  availability of services and materials for our clients to grow their capital expenditures. 14 Table of Contents The mining, oil and natural gas industries have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield and mining products and services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the mining, oil and natural gas industries could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our operating results. Our Corrpro business is party to certain contracts with the U.S. government that may be terminated by the U.S. government at any time without cause. Our Corrpro business sells products and services to the U.S. government, including the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army. These government contracts generally contain standard provisions that permit the U.S. government to terminate these contracts without cause. In the event of such a termination, we are entitled to receive reimbursement for costs plus a reasonable profit on the basis of our work completed. In addition, these contracts may contain certain completion schedule requirements that would require our payment of liquidated damages if such requirements are not met as a result of circumstances within our control. The government procurement programs under which these contracts are issued are also subject to budget reductions and reallocations as well as policy changes that could alter the demand for our products and services under these contracts. Such cutbacks or policy changes could, therefore, adversely impact our revenues. The general downturn in U.S. economic conditions, and specifically a downturn in the municipal bond market, may reduce our business prospects and decrease our revenues and cash flows. Our business is affected by general economic conditions. Any extended weakness in the U.S. economy could reduce our business prospects and could cause decreases in our revenues and operating cash flows. Specifically, a downturn in the municipal bond market caused by an actual downgrade of monoline insurers could result in our municipal customers being required to spend municipal funds previously allocated to projects that would benefit our business to pay off outstanding bonds. We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency fluctuation. Through our international subsidiaries and joint ventures, our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic and political conditions that are beyond our control. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, 33.9% and 39.2%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from international operations. We expect a significant portion of our revenues and profits to come from international operations and joint ventures for the foreseeable future and to continue to grow over time. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations, demands for payments that may be illegal under U.S. law and, in some cases, international hostilities. To the extent that our international operations are affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and losses that could significantly reduce our revenues and profits. From time to time, our contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies, which will result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits. Our backlog is an uncertain indicator of our future earnings. Our backlog, which at December 31, 2009 was approximately $463.4 million, is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellation. The revenues projected in this backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. We may be unable to complete some projects included in our backlog in the estimated time and, as a result, such projects could remain in the backlog for extended periods of time. To the extent that we experience project cancellation or scope adjustments, we could face a reduction in the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues that we actually receive from such backlog. Our bonding capacity may be limited in certain circumstances. A significant portion of our projects require us to procure a bond to secure performance. From time to time, it may be difficult to find sureties who will provide the contract-required bonding at acceptable rates for reasons beyond our control (for example, as a result of changing political or economic conditions in a foreign country). With respect to our joint ventures, our ability to obtain a bond also may depend on the credit and performance risks of our joint venture partners, some of whom may not be as financially strong as we are. Our inability to obtain bonding on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business. 15 Table of Contents Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify such expenses. We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We cannot assure that we will succeed in developing, introducing and marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenues to justify the expenses and resources devoted to this product diversification effort. We occasionally access the financial markets to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs. Our ability to access these markets may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control and could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations or implement our operating strategy. We occasionally borrow under our existing credit facility to fund operations, including working capital investments. Market disruptions such as those recently experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, resulting in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Continued uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade and general economic downturns in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our operating strategy could be adversely affected. The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for our customers. The recent economic downturn has resulted in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers ability to secure the financing necessary to proceed or continue with pipe installation, rehabilitation, coating or cathodic protection projects. Our customers or potential customers inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new projects or the suspension of projects already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our services and negatively impact our revenues and earnings. The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may result in investors selling shares of our common stock at a loss. The trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts that cover our stock or our failure to meet these estimates;  conditions or trends in the U.S. sewer rehabilitation market;  conditions or trends in mined materials, oil and natural gas markets;  changes in municipal and corporate spending practices;  a downturn of the municipal bond market or lending markets generally;  changes in market valuations of other companies operating in our industries;  announcements by us or our competitors of a significant acquisition or divestiture; and  additions or departures of key personnel. In addition, the stock market in general and the Nasdaq Global Select Market in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Such stock price volatility could result in investors selling shares of our common stock at a loss. 16 Table of Contents Future sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Sales of substantial numbers of additional shares of our common stock or any shares of our preferred stock, including sales of shares in connection with any future acquisitions, or the perception that such sales could occur, may have a harmful effect on prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at a time and price favorable to us. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy obligations upon exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons. Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that we have authority to issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2009, 38,933,944 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock. Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that our Board of Directors has the authority, without any action of our stockholders, to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued upon such terms and with such designations as our Board of Directors may fix in its discretion, including with respect to: the payment of dividends upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up; voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock; dividend rates; redemption or conversion rights; liquidation preferences; or voting rights. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock set forth in our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, the certificate of designation relating to such class or series of preferred stock, or as otherwise required by law, any stockholder action may be taken only at a meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any written consent by such stockholders. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors is required to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with such arrangement. These provisions could potentially be used to discourage attempts by others to obtain control of our Company through merger, tender offer, proxy, consent or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult or more costly, even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders. These provisions also may make it more difficult for stockholders to take action opposed by our Board of Directors or otherwise adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our present policy is to retain earnings to provide for the operation and expansion of our business. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, cash flows, financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Furthermore, under the terms of certain debt arrangements to which we are a party, we are subject to certain limitations on paying dividends. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
