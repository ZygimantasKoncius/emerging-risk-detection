Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects OPERATING RESULTS Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2008 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2007 Overview Sonys sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased 6.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Sales within the Electronics segment and the Game segment increased while sales for the Pictures segment and revenue for the Financial Services segment decreased. In the Electronics segment, while there was a decline in sales of such products as LCD rear-projection televisions, sales to outside customers increased 9.0 percent compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in sales of LCD televisions, PCs and compact digital cameras. Sales within the Game segment increased 26.3 percent compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of a significant increase in sales of PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3). In the Pictures segment, sales decreased 11.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year as motion pictures sales decreased primarily due to fewer films being released during the current fiscal year. Revenues decreased 10.5 percent within the Financial Services segment primarily due to net losses from investments in the separate account and the deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds in the general account reflecting a significant decline in the Japanese stock market partially offset by an increase in insurance premium revenue at Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony Life). Operating income increased 421.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income within the Electronics segment increased 121.8 percent mainly as a result of an increase in sales and the positive impact from the depreciation of the yen against the euro. In the previous fiscal year, a 51.2 billion yen provision was recorded for charges related to recalls by certain notebook computer makers and the subsequent global replacement program by Sony and certain notebook computer makers involving battery packs containing Sony-manufactured battery cells. A portion of the provision totaling 15.7 billion yen was reversed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 based on the actual results of recalls and replacements as compared to original estimates. In the Game segment, operating losses decreased by 107.8 billion yen to 124.5 billion yen primarily due to a decrease in the operating losses of the PS3 business as a result of successful PS3 hardware cost reductions and increased sales of PS3 software. In the Pictures segment, operating income increased 26.5 percent compared with the previous fiscal year primarily due to the strong performance of prior year films in the home entertainment and television markets as well as the benefit from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against Kirch Media GmbH & Co. KGaA (Kirch Media), a former licensee of film and television product. In the Financial Services segment, operating income decreased 73.1 percent as compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities in the general account of Sony Life reflecting a significant decline in the Japanese stock market. 31 Table of Contents Operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 included one-time gains primarily from a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 60.7 billion yen which was recorded in Corporate, a 15.6 billion yen gain which was recorded in the operating income of the Electronics segment relating to the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor operations in Nagasaki, Japan, including machinery and equipment, and a 10.0 billion yen gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin which was recorded in the operating income of All Other. Operating income in the previous fiscal year included a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 21.7 billion yen, of which 2.6 billion yen was recorded within All Other and the remaining amount was recorded in Corporate. Operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 included a gain from the reversal of a portion of a legal provision as a result of the resolution of a legal matter, while a comparable gain was recorded in the previous fiscal year attributed to the reversal of a portion of patent-related provisions. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 47.3 billion yen, an increase from the 38.8 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics segment. Of the total 47.3 billion yen incurred, Sony recorded 12.6 billion yen in personnel-related costs. Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment amounted to 45.6 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, compared with 37.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Sony made the decision to exit the LCD rear-projection television business in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 due to the shrinking market for these products. In association with this action, Sony recorded 19.7 billion yen of restructuring charges consisting mainly of inventory write downs. Of this amount, 11.9 billion yen was recorded in cost of sales and 6.7 billion yen was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. This phase of the restructuring program was completed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and the remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2008 was 1.6 billion yen, which is expected to be paid during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009. In addition to the restructuring efforts described above, Sony has undergone several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs within its Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges totaling 11.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2008 was 9.4 billion yen and will be paid throughout the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2007 2008 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 8,295.7 8,871.4 +6.9 % Operating income 71.8 374.5 +421.9 Income before income taxes 102.0 466.3 +357.0 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 78.7 100.8 +28.2 Net income 126.3 369.4 +192.4 32 Table of Contents Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 575.7 billion yen, or 6.9 percent, to 8,871.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in this analysis of the ratio of cost of sales, including research and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes financial service revenue. This is because financial service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 400.4 billion yen, or 6.8 percent, to 6,290.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and decreased from 76.8 percent to 75.6 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio decreased from 78.8 percent to 77.9 percent in the Electronics segment, decreased from 102.8 percent to 93.9 percent in the Game segment, and decreased from 60.3 percent to 58.6 percent in the Pictures segment. In the Electronics segment, there was an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for several products, in particular PCs, compact digital cameras and video cameras. The cost of sales ratio in the Game segment improved primarily as a result of PS3 hardware cost reductions and increased sales of PS3 software. In the Pictures segment, the cost of sales ratio decreased compared to the previous fiscal year mainly due to the higher home entertainment and television revenues from prior year films. Personnel-related costs included in cost of sales were 487.8 billion yen, an increase of 30.5 billion yen, primarily recorded within the Electronics segment. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 23.4 billion yen to 520.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 6.3 percent compared to 7.1 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 74.0 billion yen, or 4.1 percent, to 1,714.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 23.3 percent in the previous fiscal year to 20.6 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 18.2 percent to 16.2 percent in the Electronics segment. This improvement is due to the recording of the provision for charges related to the notebook computer battery pack recalls and subsequent global replacement program in the previous fiscal year and a reversal of the portion of the provision in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 based on the actual results of recalls and replacements as compared to original estimates. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 20.0 percent to 15.8 percent in the Game segment and from 35.2 percent to 35.1 percent in the Pictures segment. Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 19.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly within the Electronics and the Pictures segment. Advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year decreased by 46.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year primarily due to decreased advertising and publicity expenses within the Pictures segment. Gain on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 37.8 billion yen, compared with a 5.8 billion yen loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net recorded in the previous fiscal year. The gain recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 is primarily from a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 60.7 billion yen and gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin of 10.0 billion yen. A gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 21.7 billion yen was recorded in the previous fiscal year. 33 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 302.7 billion yen, or 421.9 percent, to 374.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin increased from 0.9 percent to 4.2 percent. In descending order by yen amount, the Electronics segment, the Pictures segment, All Other and the Financial Services segment contributed to operating income. An operating loss was recorded within the Game segment. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, other income increased by 54.3 billion yen, or 57.0 percent, to 149.4 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 7.3 billion yen, or 11.2 percent, to 57.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 91.8 billion yen, an increase of 61.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees increased by 50.5 billion yen, or 160.4 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, to 82.1 billion yen. This increase is due to the recording of a gain of 81.0 billion yen for the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees as a result of the global initial public offering of shares of Sony Financial Holdings Inc. (SFH) in connection with the listing of shares on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in October 2007. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, there was a gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees recorded on the sale of a portion of the stock held in StylingLife Holdings Inc. (StylingLife). Interest and dividends in other income of 34.3 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, an increase of 6.0 billion yen, or 21.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, interest expense totaling 22.9 billion yen was recorded, a decrease of 4.3 billion yen, or 15.9 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. In addition, net foreign exchange income of 5.6 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, compared to a net foreign exchange loss of 18.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Net foreign exchange income was recorded due to the value of the yen, especially during the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, appreciating in value against other currencies from the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts are entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased 364.3 billion yen, or 357.0 percent, to 466.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of the increase in operating income and the gain on the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees mentioned above. Income Taxes During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony recorded 203.5 billion yen of income taxes resulting in an effective tax rate of 43.6 percent. In the previous fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 52.8 percent and exceeded the Japanese statutory tax rate as a result of losses recorded by certain overseas subsidiaries with tax rates that are lower than the rate in Japan. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method (Refer to Note of Critical Accounting Policies.) Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was 100.8 billion yen, an increase of 22.2 billion yen, or 28.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies reported for Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was 79.5 billion 34 Table of Contents yen, a decrease of 5.8 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year, due to higher research and development expenses as a percentage of sales. Sony recorded equity in net income of 10.0 billion yen for SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG), an increase of 5.0 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to a reduction in restructuring costs compared to the previous fiscal year, lower marketing costs, a reduction in overhead costs from continued restructuring, a gain on the sale of an interest in a joint venture of SONY BMG and the favorable impact of currency fluctuations. Sony recorded equity in net income of 7.4 billion yen, a 2.4 billion yen increase compared to the prior fiscal year, for S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD), a joint-venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung) for the manufacture of amorphous thin film transistor (TFT) LCD panels. Sony did not record any equity gain or loss for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. (MGM) in the current fiscal year compared to equity in net loss of 18.9 billion yen recorded in the prior fiscal year. As of March 31, 2007, Sony no longer had any book basis in MGM and, accordingly, no additional losses were recorded during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Minority Interest in Income (Loss) of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries of 5.8 billion yen was recorded compared to minority interest in income of 0.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Minority interest in loss was recorded mainly due to the loss recorded at SFH subsequent to the change in Sony Corporations ownership. Sony Corporations ownership percentage in SFH was reduced from 100 percent to 60 percent after the global initial public offering of SFH shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. The operating results of SFH in the second half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 were negatively impacted mainly by the deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities at Sony Life. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 243.1 billion yen, or 192.4 percent, to 369.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 1.5 percent to 4.2 percent. Return on stockholders equity increased from 3.8 percent to 10.8 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.) Basic net income per share was 368.33 yen compared with 126.15 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 351.10 yen compared with 120.29 yen in the previous fiscal year.

Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net increased 2.6 billion yen to 13.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes a 6.7 billion yen loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net on LCD rear-projection televisions. The amount of operating income recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased significantly due to the impact of the provision recorded in the previous fiscal year for charges related to the notebook computer battery pack recalls and subsequent global replacement program, the reversal of a portion of the provision in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, increased sales of the segment, and the positive impact of the depreciation of the yen against the euro. Also contributing to the increase in Electronics segment profit was the recording of a 15.6 billion yen gain relating to the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor operations in Nagasaki, Japan, including machinery and equipment. Regarding profit performance by product, profitability of products such as LCD televisions worsened due to unit selling price declines while profit increased mainly for PCs and compact digital cameras, which experienced higher sales, for system large-scale integration (LSIs), which saw an increase 37 Table of Contents in sales of semiconductors for the Game segment, and for home-use video cameras, which experienced increased sales of high value-added models. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for approximately 15 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining balance of approximately 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 267.5 billion yen, or 26.3 percent, to 1,284.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 124.5 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, which was a decrease of 107.8 billion yen from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. By region, although sales decreased slightly in Japan, there was an increase in sales in North America and Europe. Overall hardware sales increased as a result of a significant increase in sales of PS3, as well as an increase in sales of PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) (PSP), for which a new slimmer, lighter model was released. Sales of PlayStation®2 (PS2) decreased compared to the previous fiscal year. Overall software sales increased as a result of an increase in PS3 software sales compared to the previous fiscal year. Total worldwide unit sales of hardware and software were as follows: Worldwide hardware unit sales (increase/decrease year-on-year ):* à PS2: 13.73 million units (a decrease of 0.98 million units) à PSP: 13.89 million units (an increase of 4.36 million units) à PS3: 9.24 million units (an increase of 5.63 million units) Worldwide software unit sales (increase/decrease year-on-year ):*/** à PS2: 154.0 million units (a decrease of 39.5 million units) à PSP: 55.5 million units (an increase of 0.8 million units) à PS3: 57.9 million units (an increase of 44.6 million units) * For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the method of reporting hardware and software unit sales has been changed from production shipments to recorded sales. In accordance with this change, the numbers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 have been restated. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. The operating loss decreased significantly compared with the previous fiscal year. Although there was a loss arising from the strategic pricing of PS3 hardware at points lower than its production cost, the operating losses of the PS3 business decreased as a result of successful hardware cost reductions and increased sales of software. The strong performance of the PSP business with the introduction of a new model also contributed to the decrease in the operating loss of the overall Game segment. Due to these reasons, the cost of sales to sales ratio decreased 8.9 percentage points, from 102.8 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 93.9 percent. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased 4.2 percentage points from 20.0 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 15.8 percent mainly due to decreased advertising and marketing expenses. 38 Table of Contents Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 108.3 billion yen, or 11.2 percent, to 857.9 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 11.3 billion yen, or 26.5 percent, to 54.0 billion yen and the operating margin increased from 4.4 percent to 6.3 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE), a U.S.-based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment decreased approximately 9 percent and operating income increased by approximately 40 percent. Sales decreased primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues as fewer films were released in the current fiscal year, as compared to the number of films released in the previous fiscal year. Major films released in the fiscal year that contributed to both theatrical and home entertainment revenues included Spider-Man 3 and Superbad. Sales for the fiscal year release slate decreased approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in revenues from current year films was partially offset by an approximately 300 million U.S. dollar increase in home entertainment and television revenues from prior year films (i.e., films that had their initial U.S. theatrical release in the prior fiscal year). Total revenues for the Pictures segment also benefited from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against Kirch Media, a former licensee of film and television product. Television product revenues increased by approximately 29 million U.S. dollars primarily as a result of higher advertising and subscription sales from several international channels. Operating income for the segment increased primarily due to the strong performance of prior year films in the home entertainment and television markets. Operating income from prior year films increased approximately 225 million U.S. dollars, due to the strong performance from a number of films including Ghost Rider, Stomp the Yard and Casino Royale. Operating income also benefited from the sale of the bankruptcy claim and the higher television business revenues referred to above. As of March 31, 2008, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Financial Services Note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance Inc. (Sony Assurance) and Sony Bank Inc. (Sony Bank) discussed below on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services segment revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 68.2 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 581.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 61.5 billion yen, or 73.1 percent, to 22.6 billion yen and the operating income margin decreased to 3.9 percent compared with 13.0 percent in the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue decreased by 81.0 billion yen, or 14.9 percent, to 464.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Although revenue from insurance premiums increased due to an increase in insurance-in-force, revenue decreased due to a net loss from investments in the separate account, a deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities in the general account reflecting a significant decline in the Japanese stock market this fiscal year. Operating income at Sony Life decreased by 70.1 billion yen, or 85.9 percent, to 11.5 billion yen. This decrease was mainly due to a deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities in the general account which more than offset the contribution from increased insurance premium revenue. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by a steady expansion in the number of automobile policies-in-force. Despite higher insurance revenue, operating income decreased due to a deterioration in the net loss ratio and expense ratio (the ratio of sales, general and administrative expenses and commissions to net premiums written). 39 Table of Contents At Sony Bank, revenue increased mainly due to foreign exchange valuation gains from part of Sony Banks foreign currency deposits brought about by a significant appreciation of the yen. As a result, operating income significantly increased. At Sony Finance International, Inc. (Sony Finance), a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, revenue increased overall mainly due to revenue increases from the electronic settlement business and the credit card business. The operating loss at Sony Finance decreased overall primarily due to increased profit at the electronic settlement business and the leasing business, as well as a decrease in losses at the credit card business. Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of operations for the Financial Services segment alone and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without Financial Services and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Financial Services 2007 2008 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 649,341 581,121 Financial service expenses 565,199 558,488 Operating income 84,142 22,633 Other income (expenses), net 9,886 (383 ) Income before income taxes 94,028 22,250 Income taxes and other 33,536 11,908 Net income 60,492 10,342 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Sony without Financial Services 2007 2008 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 7,680,578 8,324,828 Costs and expenses 7,694,375 7,974,630 Operating income (loss) (13,797 ) 350,198 Other income (expenses), net 27,917 100,479 Income before income taxes 14,120 450,677 Income taxes and other (57,991 ) 93,373 Net income 72,111 357,304 40 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Consolidated 2007 2008 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 624,282 553,216 Net sales and operating revenue 7,671,413 8,318,198 8,295,695 8,871,414 Costs and expenses 8,223,945 8,496,932 Operating income 71,750 374,482 Other income (expenses), net 30,287 91,835 Income before income taxes 102,037 466,317 Income taxes and other (24,291 ) 96,882 Net income 126,328 369,435 All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ), a Japanese domestic recorded music business; Sony Music Entertainment Inc. (SMEI)s music publishing business; So-net Entertainment Corporation (So-net), an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan; and an advertising agency business in Japan. Trademark royalty income from Sony Ericsson is also included in sales and operating income of All Other. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 27.1 billion yen, or 7.6 percent, to 382.2 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total sales, 82 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating income for All Other increased by 21.3 billion yen, or 73.9 percent from the previous fiscal year, to 50.2 billion yen. The increase in sales is mainly due to the contribution of sales from Famous Music LLC (Famous Music), a U.S-based music publishing company that was acquired by Sonys U.S.-based music publishing subsidiary Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC (Sony ATV) and consolidated in the current fiscal year, the receipt of a settlement payment related to copyright infringement claims and an increase in sales at SMEJ and So-net. An increase in trademark royalty income from Sony Ericsson also contributed to the increase in sales. Sales at SMEJ increased compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in music download sales. Best selling albums that contributed to sales during the fiscal year included ORANGE RANGEs ORANGE and RANGE, Ken Hirais FAKIN POP and YUIs CANT BUY MY LOVE. Sales at So-net increased compared to previous fiscal year primarily due to higher fee revenue from broadband connections, especially fiber-optic. Operating income for All Other increased compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to recording a 10.0 billion yen gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the receipt of a settlement payment related to copyright infringement claims, an increase in trademark royalty income from Sony Ericsson and an increase in operating income at So-net. Operating income at SMEJ increased approximately 4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in animation DVD sales as well as the above-mentioned increase in music download sales. Part of the gain on the sale of a portion of Sonys former headquarters site in the amount of 2.6 billion yen was included in operating income within All Other in the previous fiscal year. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the average value of the yen was 113.3 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 160.0 yen against the euro, which was 2.4 percent higher against the U.S. dollar and 7.1 percent lower against the euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. 41 Table of Contents In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that results presented on a local currency basis provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations largely because the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges most of the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment. In the Financial Services segment, Sony uses derivatives for Asset Liability Management (ALM) and trading. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2008, these cash flow hedges were fully effective. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2008 were 2,019.8 billion yen, 215.7 billion yen and 25.9 billion yen, respectively. Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2007 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2006 Overview Sonys sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased 10.5 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Sales within the Electronics segment, the Game segment and the Pictures segment increased while Financial Services revenue decreased. In the Electronics segment, although there was a decline in sales of such products as CRT televisions, sales to outside customers increased 13.5 percent compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in sales of LCD televisions. Sales within the Game segment increased 6.1 percent compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of the launch of PS3 in Japan, North America and Europe. In the Pictures segment, sales increased 29.5 percent compared to the previous fiscal year due to higher worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenue from films released in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 as compared to those released in the previous fiscal year. Revenues decreased 12.6 percent within the Financial Services segment primarily due to 42 Table of Contents lower valuation gains in the general account and the separate account at Sony Life, compared to the previous fiscal year, when there was a significant increase in the Japanese stock market. Operating income decreased 68.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income for the previous fiscal year included a one time net gain of 73.5 billion yen resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, of which 64.5 billion yen was recorded within the Electronics segment. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded a 51.2 billion yen provision related to recalls by Dell Inc., Apple Inc. and Lenovo, Inc. of notebook computer battery packs that used lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by Sony and the subsequent global replacement program initiated by Sony for certain notebook computer battery packs used by Sony and several other notebook computer manufacturers that used lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by Sony. Despite the recording of this provision, operating income within the Electronics segment increased 1,720.1 percent mainly as a result of an increase in sales to outside customers and the positive impact from the depreciation of the yen versus the U.S. dollar and the euro. In the Game segment, an operating loss was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 as a result of the sale of PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period. In the Pictures segment, operating income increased 55.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year due to strong worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenue on feature films released in the current fiscal year. In the Financial Services segment, operating income decreased 55.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year as a result of decreased valuation gains from investments in the general account, including valuation gains from convertible bonds at Sony Life. Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 included a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters in the amount of 21.7 billion yen, of which 2.6 billion yen was recorded within All Other and the remaining amount was recorded in Corporate. Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was negatively affected by the recording of certain provisions for outstanding legal proceedings including the European Commissions investigation in connection with professional videotape claims, partially offset by the reversal of a portion of provisions related to the resolution of certain patent claims recorded in prior periods. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 38.8 billion yen, a decrease from the 138.7 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics segment. Of the total 38.8 billion yen, Sony recorded 10.8 billion yen in personnel-related costs including early retirement programs. Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 were 37.4 billion yen, compared to 125.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Due to the worldwide market shrinkage as a result of demand shift from CRT televisions to LCD and plasma televisions, Sony has been implementing a worldwide plan to rationalize CRT and CRT television production facilities and has been downsizing its business over several years. As a part of this restructuring program, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 1.7 billion yen for CRT television manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The charge was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. While continuing to manufacture and sell CRT televisions in countries and territories where demand remains, Sony is actively shifting its focus in those areas to LCD televisions. As a result, Sony planned to cease manufacturing CRTs by March 2008, after it has stockpiled a sufficient quantity for future use. As a result of the contraction of the European rear-projection television market, Sony decided to discontinue the production of LCD rear-projection televisions in Europe. In association with this action, Sony recorded inventory writedowns and charges for supplier claims of 3.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, with most of these expenses recorded as cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. 43 Table of Contents In addition to the above restructuring efforts, Sony undertook headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs in the Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 9.7 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2007 was 7.2 billion yen and was fully paid as of March 31, 2008. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2006 2007 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,510.6 8,295.7 +10.5 % Operating income 226.4 71.8 −68.3 Income before income taxes 286.3 102.0 −64.4 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 13.2 78.7 +496.9 Net income 123.6 126.3 +2.2 Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 785.1 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 8,295.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in this analysis of the ratio of cost of sales, including research and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes financial service revenue. This is because financial service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 738.2 billion yen, or 14.3 percent, to 5,889.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and increased from 75.9 percent to 76.8 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio decreased from 80.6 percent to 78.8 percent in the Electronics segment, increased from 80.4 percent to 102.8 percent in the Game segment, and increased from 60.2 percent to 60.3 percent in the Pictures segment. In the Electronics segment, there was an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for several products, in particular compact digital cameras, LCD televisions and video cameras. In the Game segment, there was a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio. This deterioration was primarily the result of losses arising from the sale of PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period, as well as the recording of other charges in association with the preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform. In the Pictures segment, operating income increased due to substantially higher revenue. However, the cost of sales ratio was flat compared to the previous fiscal year due to the recording of production expenses associated with several new network television shows in the television business during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and the absence of a licensing agreement extension for Wheel of Fortune, which was recognized in the previous fiscal year. Personnel-related costs included in cost of sales were 457.3 billion yen, an increase of 1.0 billion yen, primarily recorded within the Electronics segment. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 12.1 billion yen to 543.9 billion yen compared with the previous 44 Table of Contents fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 7.1 percent compared to 7.8 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 261.4 billion yen, or 17.1 percent, to 1,788.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 22.5 percent in the previous fiscal year to 23.3 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 18.0 percent to 18.2 percent in the Electronics segment and from 18.7 percent to 20.0 percent in the Game segment. On the other hand, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 36.0 percent to 35.2 percent in the Pictures segment. Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 54.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to the recording of a gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. In addition, advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 86.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year primarily due to increased advertising and publicity expenses within the Pictures segment. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 5.8 billion yen, compared with 73.9 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to losses on the sale, disposal and impairment of CRT and CRT television production equipment in the Electronics segment, as well as an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex, in the previous fiscal year. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased by 154.7 billion yen, or 68.3 percent, to 71.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin decreased from 3.0 percent to 0.9 percent. In descending order by amount of financial impact, the Electronics segment, Financial Services segment, the Pictures segment and All Other contributed to operating income. On the other hand, an operating loss was recorded within the Game segment primarily due to losses arising from the sale of PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period, as well as the recording of other charges in association with the preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, other income decreased by 23.3 billion yen, or 19.6 percent, to 95.2 billion yen, while other expenses increased by 6.4 billion yen, or 10.9 percent, to 64.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 30.3 billion yen, a decrease of 29.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees decreased by 29.3 billion yen, or 48.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, to 31.5 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, there was a gain recorded on the sale of a portion of the stock held in StylingLife. However, the total gain on change in ownership interests declined as Sony recorded a gain on change in interest of 60.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year resulting from the initial public offering of So-net, and the sale of a portion of the stock held in both Monex Beans Holdings, Inc., and So-net M3 Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of So-net. Interest and dividends in other income of 28.2 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, an increase of 3.3 billion yen, or 13.2 percent, compared with the previous year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, interest expense totaling 27.3 billion yen was recorded, a decrease of 1.7 billion yen, or 5.9 percent, compared with the previous year. In addition, a net foreign exchange loss of 18.8 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, an increase of 15.8 billon yen from the previous fiscal year. The net foreign exchange loss was recorded because the value of the yen, especially during the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, was lower than the value of the yen at the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and 45 Table of Contents foreign currency option contracts. These contracts were entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased 184.3 billion yen, or 64.4 percent, to 102.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, as a result of the decrease in operating income and the decrease in the net amount of other income and other expenses mentioned above. Income Taxes During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded 53.9 billion yen of income taxes at an effective tax rate of 52.8 percent. This effective tax rate exceeded the Japanese statutory tax rate as a result of losses recorded by certain overseas subsidiaries with tax rates that are lower than the rate in Japan. The effective tax rate was 61.6 percent in the previous fiscal year and exceeded the Japanese statutory tax rate due to additional valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets by Sony Corporation and several of Sonys Japanese and overseas consolidated subsidiaries due to continued losses recorded by these entities and the recording of an additional tax provision for the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was 78.7 billion yen, an increase of 65.5 billion yen, or 496.9 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies reported for Sony Ericsson was 85.3 billion yen, an increase of 56.3 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year, due to the increase in sales of hit models such as Walkman® and Cyber-shot phones. Sony recorded equity in net income of 5.0 billion yen for SONY BMG, a decrease of 0.8 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Although there was a favorable impact due to an industry-related legal settlement, a year-on-year reduction in restructuring charges, and reductions in overhead costs from continued restructuring, sales declined due to the accelerated decline in the worldwide physical music market. Sony recorded equity in net income of 6.4 billion yen (before the elimination of unrealized intercompany profits of 1.4 billion yen), a 13.6 billion yen improvement compared to the prior fiscal year, for S-LCD, a joint-venture with Samsung for the manufacture of TFT LCD panels. Sony recorded equity in net loss of 18.9 billion yen for MGM, an increase in the amount of equity in net loss of 2.0 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. The equity in net loss for MGM included non-cash interest expense of 9.6 billion yen on cumulative preferred stock compared to 6.0 billion yen of non-cash interest expense on cumulative preferred stock recorded in the previous fiscal year. Minority Interest in Income (Loss) of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries of 0.5 billion yen was recorded compared to minority interest in loss of 0.6 billion yen in the previous year. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 2.7 billion yen, or 2.2 percent, to 126.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Despite the decrease in income before income taxes, net income increased mainly due to the decrease of income taxes and an increase in equity in net income of affiliated companies. As a percentage of sales, net income decreased from 1.6 percent to 1.5 percent. Return on stockholders equity decreased from 4.1 percent to 3.8 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007.) Basic net income per share was 126.15 yen compared with 122.58 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 120.29 yen compared with 116.88 yen in the previous fiscal year.

Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Business Segment Information Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2006 2007 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue Electronics 5,190.2 6,072.4 +17.0 % Game 958.6 1,016.8 +6.1 Pictures 745.9 966.3 +29.5 Financial Services 743.2 649.3 −12.6 All Other 411.5 355.1 −13.7 Elimination (538.9 ) (764.2 )  Consolidated 7,510.6 8,295.7 +10.5 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2006 2007 Percent change (Yen in billions) Operating income (loss) Electronics 8.8 160.5 +1,720.1 % Game 8.7 (232.3 )  Pictures 27.4 42.7 +55.7 Financial Services 188.3 84.1 −55.3 All Other 18.8 28.9 +53.3 Sub-Total 252.2 83.9 −66.7 Elimination and unallocated corporate expenses (25.7 ) (12.2 )  Consolidated 226.4 71.8 −68.3 Electronics Sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased 882.2 billion yen, or 17.0 percent, to 6,072.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 151.7 billion yen, or 1,720.1 percent, to 160.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year and the operating income to sales ratio increased from 0.2 percent to 2.6 percent. Sales to outside customers on a yen basis increased 13.5 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographical area, sales increased by 7 percent in Japan, by 9 percent in the U.S., by 24 percent in Europe, and by 14 percent in Other Areas. In Japan, there was a significant increase in the sales of mobile phones, principally to Sony Ericsson, and LCD televisions, while sales decreased for DVD-Video recorders, PCs and CRT televisions. In the U.S., sales of LCD televisions significantly increased, while sales decreased for rear-projection and CRT televisions. In Europe, sales increased for LCD televisions and PCs, while sales declined for CRT televisions and home-use video cameras. In Other Areas, sales of LCD televisions and compact digital cameras increased, while sales of mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson, and CRT televisions decreased. The decrease in sales of mobile phones was due to the impact of the deconsolidation resulting from the transfer to Sony Ericsson of the stock of a Chinese subsidiary that mainly assembled mobile phones in the previous fiscal year. 47 Table of Contents Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Audio sales decreased by 13.3 billion yen, or 2.5 percent, to 522.9 billion yen. Sales of flash memory and hard drive digital audio players decreased due to a change in model mix, as unit shipments of approximately 4.5 million units were flat compared to the previous fiscal year. In addition, there was a significant decrease in sales of both CD and MiniDisc (MD) format headphone stereos due to a shift in market demand. However, car audio and home audio sales increased. Video sales increased by 121.8 billion yen, or 11.9 percent, to 1,143.1 billion yen. Sales of compact digital cameras increased in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. Worldwide shipments of compact digital cameras increased by approximately 3.5 million units to approximately 17.0 million units. Sales of DVD recorders decreased as worldwide shipments decreased by approximately 150,000 units to approximately 1.85 million units. Worldwide shipments of home-use video cameras decreased by approximately 150,000 units to approximately 7.45 million units. DVD-Video player unit shipments decreased by approximately 100,000 units to approximately 7.9 million units. Televisions sales increased by 299.2 billion yen, or 32.2 percent, to 1,227.0 billion yen. There was a significant increase in worldwide sales of LCD televisions, as worldwide shipments of LCD televisions increased by approximately 3.5 million units, to approximately 6.3 million units. Sales of LCD rear-projection televisions decreased significantly as a result of declining sales prices, despite an increase in worldwide shipments of approximately 50,000 units, as compared to the previous fiscal year, to approximately 1.10 million units. There was also a significant decrease in worldwide sales of CRT televisions, primarily as a result of a decrease in worldwide shipments of CRT televisions by approximately 2.1 million units to approximately 4.7 million units. Information and Communications sales increased by 107.9 billion yen, or 12.8 percent, to 950.5 billion yen. Sales of PCs increased due to strong sales in Europe and Other Areas. Worldwide unit shipments of PCs increased approximately 300,000 units to approximately 4.0 million units. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products increased as a result of favorable sales of high-definition related products. Semiconductors sales increased by 33.5 billion yen, or 19.5 percent, to 205.8 billion yen. The increase was due to an increase in sales of CCDs and CMOS image sensors. Components sales increased by 52.3 billion yen, or 6.5 percent, to 853.0 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of lithium-ion batteries, primarily for use in PCs and power tools, and Memory Sticks. On the other hand, sales of CD-R/RW drives and optical pickups declined, primarily as a result of significant unit price declines. Sales of DVD+/-R/RW drives increased, despite a deterioration in unit selling prices, as a result of a significant growth in units sold in association with the expansion of the market. Other sales increased by 45.9 billion yen, or 9.3 percent, to 541.2 billion yen. This increase was the result of an increase in sales of mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 597.7 billion yen, or 12.5 percent to 4,782.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio improved by 1.9 percentage points to 78.8 percent compared to 80.6 percent in the previous fiscal year. There was also an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for such products as compact digital cameras, LCD televisions and home-use video cameras, although the cost of sales ratio deteriorated for products such as LCD rear-projection televisions due to sales price reductions associated with severe sales competition in North America. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 12.6 billion yen, a decrease of 11.2 billion yen compared with the 23.8 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs increased 22.2 billion yen, or 5.3 percent, from 418.1 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 440.4 billion yen. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 173.1 billion yen, or 15.7 percent to 1,106.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A provision of 51.2 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 for recalls by Dell Inc., Apple Inc. and Lenovo, Inc. of notebook computer battery packs that used lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Sony as well as the subsequent global replacement program initiated by Sony 48 Table of Contents for certain notebook computer battery packs used by Sony and several other notebook computer manufacturers that used lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by Sony. Also, an additional provision was recorded due to the expansion of models subject to free repairs and an extension of the repair period for Sony products and the products of other companies that are equipped with Sony CCDs. Results for the Electronics segment were also negatively impacted by an adjustment to reflect a more accurate method of calculating the provision for free repairs of Sony CCDs, which had the effect of further increasing the provision. Although there was a reversal of a portion of provisions related to the resolution of certain patent claims recorded in prior periods, this reversal was more than offset by the negative impact of the recording of certain provisions for outstanding legal proceedings including the European Commissions investigation in connection with professional videotape claims. Finally, a 64.5 billion yen gain recorded as a result of the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund was included in the previous fiscal year. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased because the cumulative impact of the above-mentioned items exceeded the decrease in restructuring charges that were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 35.5 billion yen from 49.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 14.0 billion yen. Of the restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, the amount recorded for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program, was 9.7 billion yen, a decrease of 35.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased 0.2 percentage points from the 18.0 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 18.2 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net decreased 12.3 billion yen to 10.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes 10.8 billion yen of restructuring charges, including 5.2 billion yen of restructuring charges related to the recording of an impairment loss for goodwill for a CRT television glass manufacturing subsidiary in the U.S. The amount of restructuring charges included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment, net in the previous fiscal year was 52.5 billion yen. The amount of operating income recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, increased significantly due to an increase in sales to outside customers and the positive impact of the depreciation of the yen. This result is in spite of the above-mentioned recording by Sony of a 51.2 billion yen provision that relates to recalls of notebook computer battery packs and the subsequent global replacement program and the recording of an additional provision related to free repairs of Sony CCDs. The operating income from the previous year included a 64.5 billion yen gain that was recorded as a result of the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Regarding profit performance by product, excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, compact digital cameras and LCD televisions, which experienced favorable sales, and video cameras, which experienced an increase in sales of high value-added models, contributed to the increase in the operating income of the segment. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Slightly more than 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, approximately 80 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining balance of approximately 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 58.2 billion yen, or 6.1 percent, to 1,016.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 232.3 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, which was a deterioration of 241.1 billion yen from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. 49 Table of Contents By region, although sales decreased slightly in Japan, there was a significant increase in sales in North America and Europe. Overall hardware sales increased as a result of the launch of PS3 in Japan, North America and Europe. However, the sales of PS2 and PSP declined due to lower unit sales compared with the previous fiscal year, and also because of a price reduction of PS2. On the other hand, overall software sales decreased as a result of lower PS2 software sales, despite an increase in PSP software sales, as well as the contribution from PS3 software sales, compared to the previous fiscal year. Total worldwide unit sales of hardware and software were as follows: Worldwide hardware unit sales (decrease compared to the previous fiscal year):* à PS2: 14.71 million units (a decrease of 1.83 million units) à PSP: 9.53 million units (a decrease of 2.35 million units) à PS3: 3.61 million units Worldwide software unit sales (increase/decrease compared to the previous fiscal year):*/** à PS2: 193.5 million units (a decrease of 30.8 million units) à PSP: 54.7 million units (an increase of 13.0 million units) à PS3: 13.3 million units * For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the method of reporting hardware and software unit sales has been changed from production shipments to recorded sales. In accordance with this change, the numbers for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2007 have been restated. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. Operating performance deteriorated significantly compared with the previous fiscal year. This deterioration was primarily the result of the loss arising from the sale of PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period, as well as the recording of other charges in association with the preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform. Operating income for the PS2 business decreased due to a decrease in software sales while operating income in the PSP business increased primarily due to continued cost reductions in hardware production. A write-down of PS3-related inventory of 81.4 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 compared with a write-down of 25.0 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated 22.4 percentage points, from 80.4 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 102.8 percent and the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased 1.3 percentage points from 18.7 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 20.0 percent for the reasons mentioned above for the decrease in operating income. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 220.4 billion yen, or 29.5 percent, to 966.3 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 15.3 billion yen, or 55.7 percent , to 42.7 billion yen and the operating margin increased from 3.7 percent to 4.4 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of SPE, a U.S. based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment increased approximately 26 percent and operating income increased by approximately 53 percent. Sales increased significantly due to higher worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenue from films released in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, as compared to those released in the previous fiscal year. Major films released in the fiscal year that contributed to both theatrical and home entertainment revenue included The Da Vinci Code, Casino Royale, Click, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and The Pursuit of Happyness. Sales for the fiscal year release slate increased approximately 1.8 billion U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. Television product revenues increased by approximately 160 million U.S. dollars primarily as a result of higher advertising and subscription sales from several international channels. 50 Table of Contents Operating income for the segment increased significantly, primarily due to the performance of films released in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Operating loss from the current fiscal year release slate decreased approximately 530 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous years release slate due to the same factors contributing to the increase in film revenue noted above. Partially offsetting this was a decrease in operating income of 98 million U.S. dollars for television product primarily due to the recording of production and marketing expenses in the current fiscal year associated with several new network and made-for-syndication television shows, combined with the absence of a licensing agreement extension for Wheel of Fortune, which was recognized in the previous fiscal year. Results for the Pictures segment were also negatively impacted by an adjustment to increase its reserve for returns of home entertainment catalog product. As of March 31, 2007, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.1 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Financial Services Note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank discussed below on a U.S. GAAP basis differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services segment revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased by 93.9 billion yen, or 12.6 percent, to 649.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 104.2 billion yen, or 55.3 percent, to 84.1 billion yen and the operating income margin decreased to 13.0 percent compared with the 25.3 percent of the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue decreased by 100.0 billion yen, or 15.5 percent, to 545.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Although revenue from insurance premiums increased at Sony Life reflecting an increase in insurance-in-force, the main reason for this decrease was lower valuation gains in the general and separate accounts as compared to the previous fiscal year, when there was a significant increase in the Japanese stock market. Operating income at Sony Life decreased by 106.8 billion yen or 56.7 percent to 81.7 billion yen, primarily due to a decrease in valuation gains from investments in the general account, including valuation gains from convertible bonds. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance-in-force. Operating income increased due to an increase in insurance revenue and an improvement in the expense ratio (the ratio of sales, general and administrative expenses and commissions to net premiums written). At Sony Bank, revenue rose mainly due to a significant decrease of foreign exchange losses from part of Sony Banks foreign currency deposits, as compared with the previous fiscal year, and an increase in interest revenue associated with an increase in the balance of assets from investing activities. As a result, Sony Bank recorded operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, as compared to an operating loss in the previous fiscal year. At Sony Finance, overall revenue decreased and the operating loss increased primarily due to decreases in revenue and profit at leasing and installment businesses. However, revenue increased in the credit card business, which resulted in a decrease in the operating loss recorded for that business. Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of operations for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment and for the Financial Services segment alone. These separate condensed presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without Financial Services and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and 51 Table of Contents all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Financial Services 2006 2007 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 743,215 649,341 Financial service expenses 554,892 565,199 Operating income 188,323 84,142 Other income (expenses), net 24,522 9,886 Income before income taxes 212,845 94,028 Income taxes and other 78,527 33,536 Net income 134,318 60,492 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Sony without Financial Services 2006 2007 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 6,799,068 7,680,578 Costs and expenses 6,762,194 7,694,375 Operating income (loss) 36,874 (13,797 ) Other income (expenses), net 36,610 27,917 Income before income taxes 73,484 14,120 Income taxes and other 84,186 (57,991 ) Net income (loss) (10,702 ) 72,111 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Consolidated 2006 2007 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 720,566 624,282 Net sales and operating revenue 6,790,031 7,671,413 7,510,597 8,295,695 Costs and expenses 7,284,181 8,223,945 Operating income 226,416 71,750 Other income (expenses), net 59,913 30,287 Income before income taxes 286,329 102,037 Income taxes and other 162,713 (24,291 ) Net income 123,616 126,328 All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from SMEJ, a Japanese domestic recorded music business; SMEIs music publishing business; So-net, an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan; and an advertising agency business in Japan. In June 2006, Sony Corporation sold 51 percent of the stock of StylingLife, a holding company comprised of six retail businesses within Sony previously included within All Other, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nikko Principal Investments Japan Ltd. Sony Corporation sold additional shares of StylingLife in December 2006, and currently holds approximately 23 percent of the total outstanding stock in StylingLife. 52 Table of Contents Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased by 56.4 billion yen, or 13.7 percent, to 355.1 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, the sales decrease within All Other reflects the deconsolidation of the six retail businesses noted above after the sale of a majority of the stock of StylingLife. Of total segment sales, 81 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating income for All Other increased from 18.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 28.9 billion yen. Sales at SMEJ declined mainly due to lower intersegment sales in association with the transfer of business activity relating to Sonys disc custom press business, which was carried out at SMEJ during the previous fiscal year, to other segments within Sony Group. Best selling albums during the fiscal year included CHEMISTRYs ALL THE BEST, Yuna Itos HEART and Angela Akis HOME. Excluding sales recorded within Sonys music business, there was a decrease in sales within All Other. This decrease was mainly due to the above-mentioned deconsolidation of Sonys retail businesses, partially offset by an increase in sales at So-net, where there was a favorable increase in fiber optic connection service subscribers. Regarding profit performance within All Other, operating income of 28.9 billion yen was recorded, an 10.0 billion yen increase compared to 18.8 billion yen of operating income recorded in the previous fiscal year. Operating income at SMEJ declined approximately 37 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly due to a decrease in album and single sales and the recognition of a gain in the previous fiscal year resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Excluding the decrease in operating income in the music business, there was an increase in operating income within All Other, mainly due to an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex, recorded in the previous fiscal year. Operating income at So-net increased mainly due to an increase in profit resulting from greater fee revenue from new subscribers. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, a gain on the sale of a portion of Sonys former headquarters site in the amount of 2.6 billion yen was included in operating income within All Other. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the average value of the yen was 116.0 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 148.6 yen against the euro, which was 3.2 percent lower against the U.S. dollar and 8.2 percent lower against the euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. In addition, Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that results presented on a local currency basis provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations mainly derived from the fact that the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. SGTS in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures 53 Table of Contents before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment utilized for portfolio investments and ALM. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2007, these cash flow hedges were fully effective. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2007 were 1,768.6 billion yen, 287.8 billion yen and 67.2 billion yen, respectively. Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Assets Total assets as of March 31, 2008 increased by 836.4 billion yen, or 7.1 percent, to 12,552.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets as of March 31, 2008 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 86.9 billion yen, or 1.2 percent, to 7,185.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets as of March 31, 2008 in the Financial Services segment increased by 648.0 billion yen, or 13.0 percent, to 5,625.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current Assets Current assets as of March 31, 2008 increased by 462.9 billion yen, or 10.2 percent, to 5,009.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current assets as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 341.7 billion yen, or 9.8 percent, to 3,836.7 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased 425.9 billion yen, or 81.4 percent, to 948.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was primarily due to the sale of a portion of the shares Sony Corporation held in SFH pursuant to the global initial public offering of SFH in connection with its listing on the TSE. Refer to Cash Flows below. Notes and accounts receivable, trade (net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns) as of March 31, 2008, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 259.6 billion yen, or 19.3 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year-end to 1,083.5 billion yen. This was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of PS3 near the end of the fiscal year compared with the previous fiscal year-end when PS3 had just begun shipping in Europe. Inventories as of March 31, 2008 increased by 80.7 billion yen, or 8.6 percent, to 1,021.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Electronics segment inventory resulting from a worldwide expansion of the LCD television business. The inventory to cost of sales turnover ratio (based on the average of inventories at the end of each fiscal year and the previous fiscal year) was 1.87 months compared to 1.78 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. Sony considers this level of inventory to be appropriate in the aggregate. Other in current assets as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased 175.6 billion yen, or 10.8 percent, to 1,801.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was primarily due to the recording of a receivable within the Electronics segment relating to the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor operations in Nagasaki, Japan, including machinery and equipment. 54 Table of Contents Current assets as of March 31, 2008 in the Financial Services segment increased by 115.9 billion yen, or 10.6 percent, to 1,205.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to an expansion of banking businesses. Investments and Advances Investments and advances as of March 31, 2008 increased by 446.9 billion yen, or 11.5 percent, to 4,335.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Investments and advances as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 104.8 billion yen, or 16.8 percent, to 518.5 billion yen. This was primarily due to the receipt of a capital redemption payment and dividends from Sony Ericsson. Investments and advances as of March 31, 2008 in the Financial Services segment increased by 532.0 billion yen, or 15.9 percent, to 3,879.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities by Sony Life, which increased assets as a result of an expansion of its business, and an increase in mortgage loans outstanding at Sony Bank. Also refer to Investments below. Property, Plant and Equipment (after deduction of accumulated depreciation) Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2008 decreased by 178.2 billion yen, or 12.5 percent, to 1,243.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 178.0 billion yen, or 12.9 percent, to 1,204.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures (additions to property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 78.4 billion yen, or 18.9 percent, to 335.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the Electronics segment decreased by 44.8 billion yen, or 12.7 percent, to 306.7 billion yen. Of this amount, approximately 90 billion yen was used for capital expenditures in the semiconductor business, including CCDs and CMOS imaging sensors. Capital expenditures decreased in the Game segment by 11.1 billion yen, or 66.4 percent, to 5.6 billion yen. In the Pictures segment, capital expenditures decreased by 1.0 billion yen, or 9.5 percent to 9.9 billion yen. In All Other, which includes the part of Sonys music business which is consolidated, 3.0 billion yen of capital expenditures were recorded, a decrease of 2.7 billion yen, or 47.4 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Other changes resulting in a decrease in property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2008 compared to March 31, 2007 include the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor operations in Nagasaki, including machinery and equipment, The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin and a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2008 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 0.2 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 38.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures in the Financial Services segment decreased by 0.5 billion yen, or 6.7 percent, to 6.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Consolidated capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 are expected to increase 28 percent to 430 billion yen primarily within the Electronics segment. For the Electronics segment, capital expenditures in the semiconductor business during the fiscal year are expected to increase by approximately 20 billion yen to approximately 110 billion yen due to an increase in the amount invested in image sensors. Other Assets Other assets as of March 31, 2008 increased by 109.2 billion yen, or 7.0 percent, to 1,659.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year end. Deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2008 decreased by 18.3 billion yen, or 8.4 percent, to 198.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year end. 55 Table of Contents Liabilities Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2008 increased by 504.1 billion yen, or 6.1 percent, to 8,810.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 173.4 billion yen, or 4.2 percent, to 3,967.5 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities in the Financial Services segment as of March 31, 2008 increased by 646.7 billion yen, or 14.9 percent, to 4,984.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current Liabilities Current liabilities as of March 31, 2008 increased by 471.5 billion yen, or 13.3 percent, to 4,023.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2008 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 57.9 billion yen, or 2.2 percent, to 2,698.5 billion yen. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 258.5 billion yen, or 319.4 percent, to 339.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was principally due to the change from long-term to current liabilities of the 250 billion yen tranche of bonds with stock acquisition rights which will come due during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009. Notes and accounts payable, trade as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 261.0 billion yen, or 22.4 percent, to 906.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was primarily due to the same reason for the decrease in notes and accounts receivable, trade, discussed above: a decrease in sales of PS3 near the end of the fiscal year compared with the previous fiscal year-end when PS3 had just begun shipping in Europe. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2008 in the Financial Services segment increased by 405.5 billion yen, or 42.4 percent, to 1,363.0 billion yen, mainly due to an increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank. Long-term Liabilities Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2008 increased by 32.6 billion yen, or 0.7 percent, to 4,787.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 231.4 billion yen, or 15.4 percent, to 1,269.0 billion yen. In addition, long-term debt as of March 31, 2008 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 274.3 billion yen, or 29.6 percent, to 651.0 billion yen. This was primarily due to the change to current liabilities of the bonds with stock acquisition rights described above. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2008 in the Financial Services segment increased by 241.2 billion yen, or 7.1 percent, to 3,621.4 billion yen. This was primarily due to an increase in insurance-in-force at Sony Life. Total Interest-bearing Debt Total interest-bearing debt as of March 31, 2008 decreased by 12.3 billion yen, or 1.1 percent, to 1,084.2 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end.

Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity as of March 31, 2008 increased by 94.4 billion yen, or 2.8 percent, to 3,465.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Retained earnings increased 339.9 billion yen, or 19.8 percent, to 2,059.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end, primarily due to net income of 369.4 billion yen. Unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of 212.5 billion yen, dividends declared of 25.1 billion yen and pension liability adjustments of 26.1 billion yen decreased shareholders equity by a total of 263.7 billion yen. 56 Table of Contents The ratio of stockholders equity to total assets decreased 1.2 percentage points compared to the end of the previous fiscal year, from 28.8 percent to 27.6 percent. Information of Financial Position Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of financial position for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment and for the Financial Services segment alone. These separate condensed presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without Financial Services and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

March 31, 2008 Fair Unrealized Unrealized Market Cost Gain Loss Value (Yen in millions) Financial Services Business: Available-for-sale Debt securities Sony Life 2,564,845 77,456 (2,644 ) 2,639,657 Other 481,159 998 (10,412 ) 471,745 Equity securities Sony Life 181,256 47,557 (14,513 ) 214,300 Other 11,452 1,036 (1,504 ) 10,984 Held to maturity Debt securities Sony Life     Other 56,737 773 (34 ) 57,476 Total Financial Services 3,295,449 127,820 (29,107 ) 3,394,162 Non-Financial Services: Available-for-sale securities 52,935 26,992 (3,574 ) 76,353 Held to maturity securities 1,103   1,103 Total Non-Financial Services 54,038 26,992 (3,574 ) 77,456 Consolidated 3,349,487 154,812 (32,681 ) 3,471,618 The most significant portion of these unrealized losses relate to investments held by Sony Life and Sony Bank. As of March 31, 2008, Sony Life had debt and equity securities which had gross unrealized losses of 2.6 billion yen and 14.5 billion yen, respectively. Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Life, approximately 1.5 percent relate to securities being in an unrealized loss position for periods greater than 12 months as of March 31, 2008. Sony Life principally invests in debt securities in various industries. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors, Moodys or other rating agencies. The percentage of non-investment grade securities held by Sony Life represents approximately 0.2 percent of Sony Lifes total investment portfolio, while the percentage of unrealized losses that relate to those non-investment grade securities was 0.7 percent of Sony Lifes total unrealized losses as of March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2008, Sony Bank had debt securities which had gross unrealized losses of 10.4 billion yen. Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Bank, approximately 60.2 percent relate to securities being in an unrealized loss position for periods greater than 12 months as of March 31, 2008. These unrealized losses related principally to Japanese government bonds. Sony Bank principally invests in Japanese national government bonds, Japanese corporate bonds and foreign bonds. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors, Moodys or other rating agencies. These unrealized losses related to numerous investments, with no single investment being in a material unrealized loss position for above-mentioned periods. In addition, there was no individual security with unrealized losses that met the test for impairment as the declines in value were observed to be small both in amounts and percentage, and therefore, the decline in value for those investments was still determined to be temporary in nature. 60 Table of Contents For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Life as of March 31, 2008 (2.6 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 4.8 percent  1 to 5 years: 3.9 percent  5 to 10 years: 4.6 percent  above 10 years: 86.7 percent In the ordinary course of business, Sony maintains long-term investment securities, included in securities investments and other issued by a number of non-public companies. The aggregate carrying amount of the investments in non-public companies at March 31, 2008 was 62.1 billion yen. A non-public equity investment is valued at cost as fair value is not readily determinable. If the value is estimated to have declined and such decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, the impairment of the investment is recognized immediately and the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, total impairment losses were 4.0 billion yen, 7.4 billion yen and 37.1 billion yen of which 0.2 billion yen, 6.1 billion yen and 24.0 billion yen, respectively, were recorded by Sony Life in Financial Services revenue. Impairment losses other than at Sony Life in each of the three fiscal years were reflected in non-operating expenses and primarily relate to certain strategic investments in non-financial services businesses. These investments primarily relate to certain strategic investments in Japan and the U.S. with which Sony has strategic relationships for the purposes of developing and marketing new technologies. Impairment losses were recorded for each of the three fiscal years as certain companies failed to successfully develop and market such technology, resulting in the operating performance of these companies being more unfavorable than previously expected. As a result the decline in the fair value of these companies was judged as other-than-temporary. None of these impairment losses were individually material to Sony. Upon determination that the value of an investment is impaired, the value of the investment is written down to its fair value. For publicly traded investments, fair value is determined by the closing stock price as of the date on which the impairment determination is made. For non-public investments, fair value is determined through the use of various methodologies such as discounted cash flows, valuation of recent financings and comparable valuations of similar companies. The impairment losses that were recorded in each of the three fiscal years related to the unique facts and circumstances of each individual investment and did not significantly impact other investments. Sony Life and Sony Banks investments constitute the majority of the investments in the Financial Services segment. Sony Life and Sony Bank account for approximately 84 percent and 14 percent of the investments of the Financial Services segment, respectively. Sony Lifes fundamental policy in managing the investments of its general account assets is to maintain the soundness of its assets and build an investment portfolio capable of ensuring stable mid- to long-term returns, taking into account anticipated risks and returns and responding quickly to changes in financial market conditions and the investment environment. Moreover, Sony Life utilizes basic idea of ALM, a method of managing interest rate fluctuation risk through the comprehensive identification of differences in duration and cash flows between assets and liabilities, and considers the long-term balance between assets and liabilities in an effort to ensure stable and sustainable returns. Sony Lifes investment policy places emphasis on risk management and seeks to achieve the goals of quality, liquidity, stability and profitability. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, considering the investment environment and its liabilities, Sony Life invested mainly in long-term (10 years) and super long-term (more than 10 years) Japanese government bonds. As for its investments in convertible bonds, Sony Life diversified its portfolio by responding to changes in market condition and issue status. Sony Bank seeks to build a portfolio that will maintain the strength and stability of its financial base while ensuring profitability, taking into account appropriate risk management activities in light of the relevant risks associated with its investments. Sony Banks securities portfolio consists mainly of Japanese government bonds, Japanese corporate bonds and foreign bonds. In addition, Sony Bank invests in non-yen-denominated foreign bonds as a means of matching its exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to a portion of the foreign currency deposits of its accountholders. Separately, Sony Bank also holds other non-yen-denominated foreign bonds as a means of diversifying its portfolio, and hedges the majority of those investments against foreign exchange risk by 61 Table of Contents using derivative instruments. With respect to loans, Sony Bank mainly offers mortgage loans to individuals and does not have any corporate loan exposure. Contractual obligations, commitments, and contingent liabilities The following table summarizes Sonys contractual obligations and major commitments as of March 31, 2008. The references to the Notes below refer to the corresponding note within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Payments Due by Period Less than 3 to 5 After 5 Total 1 year 1 to 3 year year year (Yen in millions) Contractual Obligations and Major Commitments:* Long-term debt (Note 11) Capital lease obligations (Notes 8 and 11) 51,889 9,328 11,636 6,341 24,584 Other long-term debt (Note 11) 969,049 282,551 372,314 148,357 165,827 Minimum rental payments required under operating leases (Note 8) 189,313 42,736 57,750 29,095 59,732 Purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment and other assets (Note 23) 62,044 61,869 175   Expected cost for the production or purchase of films and television programming or certain rights (Note 23) 57,258 44,841 11,928 452 37 Partnership program contract with Fédération Internationale de Football Association (Note 23) 22,944 3,306 7,389 8,166 4,083 Gross unrecognized tax benefits** (Note 20) 282,098 666    *The total amount of expected future pension payments is not included in either the above table or the total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2008 discussed below as such amount is not currently determinable. Sony expects to contribute approximately 34.0 billion yen to Japanese pension plans and approximately 5.0 billion yen to foreign pension plans during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 (Note 14). *The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under loan agreements in the Financial Services segment is not included in either the above table or the amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2008 discussed below as it is not foreseeable how many loans will be executed. The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under these contracts was 298.8 billion yen as of March 31, 2008 (Note 23). *The five-year Revolving Credit Agreement with SONY BMG, which matures on August 5, 2009 and initially provided for a base commitment of 300 million U.S. dollars, which was decreased to 200 million U.S. dollars on August 5, 2007, and additional incremental borrowings of up to 150 million U.S. dollars, are not included either in the above table or the amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2008 discussed below as such amount is not currently determinable. Sonys outstanding commitment under this Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2008 was 17.5 billion yen (Note 23). A second Revolving Credit Agreement with SONY BMG, which matures on August 5, 2011 and provides for a base commitment of 138 million U.S. dollars is not included either in the above table or the amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2008 discussed below as such amount is not currently determinable. Sonys outstanding commitment under this Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2008 was 13.8 billion yen (Note 23). 62 Table of Contents **The total amounts represent the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN No. 48. Sony estimates 666 million yen of the liability is expected to be settled within one year. The settlement period for the remaining portion of the liability, which totaled 281.4 billion yen, cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty associated with the timing of settlements with the various taxing authorities. The total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2008 was 261.1 billion yen (Note 23). The commitments include major purchase obligations as shown above. In the ordinary course of business, Sony makes commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. As of March 31, 2008, such commitments outstanding were 62.0 billion yen. Certain subsidiaries in the Pictures segment have entered into agreements with creative talent for the development and production of films and television programming as well as agreements with third parties to acquire completed films, or certain rights therein. As of March 31, 2008, the total amount of the expected cost for the production or purchase of films and television programming or certain rights under the above commitments was 57.3 billion yen. Sony Corporation has entered into a partnership program contract with Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Through this program Sony Corporation will be able to exercise various rights as an official sponsor of FIFA events from 2007 to 2014. As of March 31, 2008, Sony Corporation has committed to make payments under such contract of 22.9 billion yen. In order to fulfill its commitments, Sony will use cash generated by its operating activities, intra-group loans and borrowings from subsidiaries with excess funds to subsidiaries that are short of funds through its finance subsidiaries, and raise funds from the global capital markets and from banks when necessary. The following table summarizes Sonys contingent liabilities as of March 31, 2008. Total Amounts of Contingent Liabilities Contingent Liabilities: (Note 23) (Yen in millions ) Loan guarantees to related parties 9,762 Other 40,043 Total contingent liabilities 49,805 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Sony has certain off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources and/or credit risk support. Sony set up several accounts receivable sales programs that provide for the accelerated receipt of up to 50.0 billion yen of eligible trade accounts receivable of Sony Corporation. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to qualified special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. These transactions are accounted for as a sale in accordance with FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total receivables sold for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were 146.2 billion yen, 152.5 billion yen and 181.4 billion yen, respectively. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the sold receivables, no servicing liabilities are recorded because costs regarding collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, a subsidiary of the Financial Services segment set up several receivable sales programs that provide for the accelerated receipt of up to 18.0 billion yen of eligible receivables. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to qualified special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. These transactions are accounted for as a sale in accordance with FAS No. 140, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, receivables sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total receivables sold for the fiscal year ended March 63 Table of Contents 2008 were 113.8 billion yen. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the sold receivables, no servicing liabilities are recorded because costs regarding collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. Sony has, from time to time, entered into various arrangements with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). In several of the arrangements in which Sony holds a significant variable interest, Sony is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates these VIEs. These arrangements include facilities which provide for the leasing of certain property, the financing of film production and the U.S.-based music publishing business. In addition, Sony holds a significant variable interest in VIEs in which Sony is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate. These VIEs include the film production/co-financing arrangements noted as follows. On December 30, 2005, a subsidiary in the Pictures segment entered into a production/co-financing agreement with a VIE to co-finance 11 films that were released over the 15 months ended March 31, 2007. The subsidiary received 376 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreement to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). The subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. The subsidiary did not make any equity investment in the VIE nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIE. On April 28, 2006, the subsidiary entered into a second production/co-financing agreement with a VIE to co-finance additional films. Eight films are anticipated to be released under this financing arrangement. The subsidiary will receive approximately 190 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreement to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). Similar to the first agreement, the subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. As of March 31, 2008, seven co-financed films have been released by the subsidiary and 110 million U.S. dollars has been received from the VIE under this agreement. The subsidiary did not make any equity investment in the VIE nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIE. On January 19, 2007, the subsidiary entered into a third production/co-financing agreement with a VIE to co-finance a majority of the films to be submitted through March 2012. The subsidiary has received a commitment from the VIE that the VIE will fund up to 525 million U.S. dollars on a revolving basis to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). As of March 31, 2008, no films of the subsidiary have been funded by this VIE. Similar to the first two agreements, the subsidiary is responsible for marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. The subsidiary did not make any equity investment in the VIE nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIE. Refer to Note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on VIEs. Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony generated 757.7 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 196.7 billion yen, or 35.1 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment generated 519.1 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 213.5 billion yen, or 69.9 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment generated 242.6 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 13.9 billion yen, or 5.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, a variety of factors had a positive impact on operating cash flow, including the contribution of net income from the Electronics segment, after taking into account depreciation and amortization, and an increase in insurance premium revenue reflecting a steady increase in insurance-in-force at Sony Life. Partially offsetting these contributions was an increase in inventory, primarily within the Electronics segment. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities increased during the fiscal year mainly as a result of the increase in net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization. 64 Table of Contents Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 910.4 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 195.0 billion yen, or 27.3 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, used 14.9 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 416.2 billion yen, or 96.5 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. The Financial Services segment used 873.6 billion yen in net cash, an increase of 596.9 billion yen, or 215.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, semiconductor fabrication equipment was purchased and Sony ATV acquired Famous Music, a U.S.-based music publishing company. Partially offsetting these uses of net cash were proceeds from the sale of a portion of SFH shares, the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin and the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances, carried out primarily at Sony Life, and at Sony Bank where operations are expanding, exceeded proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly within all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, primarily due to the sale of a portion of SFH shares. On the other hand, net cash used in investing activities within the Financial Services segment increased significantly compared to the previous fiscal year primarily because the increase in payments for investments and advances, carried out primarily at Sony Life and Sony Bank, exceeded the increase in proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances compared with the previous fiscal year. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash provided by operating and investing activities combined was 504.2 billion yen, an increase of 629.7 billion yen as compared to net cash used of 125.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, 505.5 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 12.1 billion yen of net cash was used in financing activities within all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, a decrease of 71.7 billion yen compared to the 59.6 billion yen in net cash generated by financing activities in the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to the fact that straight bonds were redeemed during the fiscal year. In the Financial Services segment, as a result of an increase in policyholder accounts at Sony Life and an increase in deposits from customers in the banking business, financing activities generated 491.7 billion yen of net cash. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year increased by 286.5 billion yen, or 35.8 percent, to 1,086.4 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 425.9 billion yen, or 81.4 percent, to 948.7 billion yen, and for the Financial Services segment, decreased by 139.3 billion yen, or 50.3 percent, to 137.7 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. 65 Table of Contents Information of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited cash flow information for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment and for the Financial Services segment alone. These separate condensed presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without Financial Services and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment generated 305.6 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 53.6 billion yen, or 21.3 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the 66 Table of Contents Financial Services segment generated 256.5 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 109.4 billion yen, or 74.3 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, there was a positive impact on operating cash flow from an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade, and an increase in future insurance policy benefits and other as well as the contribution of net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization. However, primarily offsetting these contributions was an increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade, and inventory, particularly within the Electronics and Game segments. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities increased mainly as a result of an increase in net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization recorded during the fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year, as well as the effect of the gain on the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of the employee pension fund in the previous fiscal year, and the effect of an increase in revenue from insurance premiums, primarily reflecting an increase in insurance-in-force at Sony Life. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 715.4 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 155.8 billion yen, or 17.9 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, used 431.1 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 134.7 billion yen, or 45.5 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment used 276.7 billion yen in net cash, a decrease of 287.0 billion yen, or 50.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, purchases of fixed assets (capital expenditures) in the Electronics segment were made primarily for semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Part of an investment in S-LCD was also made for manufacturing facilities for 8th generation TFT LCD panels. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances, such as investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities at Sony Life and an increase in the outstanding balance of mortgage loans at Sony Bank, exceeded proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities increased within all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, reflecting the additional investment in S-LCD and the purchases of fixed assets noted above. On the other hand, net cash used in the Financial Services segment for investing activities decreased compared to the previous fiscal year due to the fact that there was an increase in the collections of investments and advances as compared to the previous fiscal year. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the difference between cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities was a net use of cash of 125.5 billion yen, an increase of 81.1 billion yen, or 182.7 percent, as compared to a net use of cash of 44.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, 247.9 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 59.6 billion yen of net cash was generated from financing activities in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, a decrease of 15.0 billion yen or 20.1 percent, compared to net cash generated in the previous fiscal year of 74.6 billion yen. This was a result, as noted above, of financing carried out through yen-denominated syndicated loans during the current fiscal year. In the Financial Services segment, as a result of an increase in policyholder accounts at Sony Life and an increase in deposits from customers at the banking business, financing activities generated 179.6 billion yen of net cash. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year increased by 96.8 billion yen, or 13.8 percent, to 799.9 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 62.6 billion yen, or 10.7 percent, to 522.9 billion yen, and for the Financial Services segment, increased by 159.4 billion, or 135.5 percent, to 277.0 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. 67 Table of Contents Information of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited cash flow information for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment and for the Financial Services segment alone.

Furthermore, the Financial Services segment is described separately at the end of this section.) An important financial objective of Sony is to maintain the strength of its balance sheet, while securing adequate liquidity for business activities. 68 Table of Contents Sony intends to continue various investments for future growth. Funding requirements that arise from its business strategy are principally covered by free cash flow generated from business operations and by cash and cash equivalents (cash balance); however, as needed, Sony has demonstrated the ability to procure funds from the financial and capital markets. In addition, to sustain sufficient liquidity, Sony has committed lines of credit with financial institutions, together with its cash balances. Liquidity Management and Market Access Sony defines its liquidity sources as the amount of cash balance (excluding restrictions on capital transfers due mainly to country regulations) and the unused amount of committed lines of credit. Sonys basic liquidity management policy is to secure sufficient liquidity throughout the relevant fiscal year, covering such factors as 50 percent of monthly consolidated sales and repayments on debt which comes due within six months. Sony has a total, translated into yen, of 597.2 billion yen in committed lines of credit, of which the unused amount was 597.1 billion yen as of March 31, 2008. Major committed lines of credit include a total, translated into yen, of 428.8 billion yen of Global Commitment Facilities contracted with a syndicate of global banks effective until March 2009, and a 150 billion yen committed line of credit contracted with Japanese financial institutions, effective until July 2009 where Sony Corporation and SGTS are defined as the borrowers. Sonys working capital needs grow significantly in the third quarter (from October to December) as a result of the general seasonality of Sonys business. In order to meet such short-term capital requirements, SGTS maintains commercial paper (CP) programs for the U.S., Europe and Japan CP markets. As of March 31, 2008, the total amount to be issued under these CP programs, translated into yen, was 1,201.3 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the largest month-end outstanding balance of CP was 200.0 billion yen in September 2007. There was no outstanding balance of CP as of March 31, 2008. Sony controls the outstanding CP amount, as part of its debt risk management, so that it does not exceed the unused amount of committed lines of credit. In addition, SGTS maintains a euro medium-term note (MTN) program with a program limit amount that translates into 501.0 billion yen. There was no outstanding balance as of March 31, 2008. In the event of a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings, even though the cost of borrowing could increase, there are no financial covenants in any of Sonys material financial agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the uses of most proceeds except that some borrowings may not be used to acquire securities listed on a U.S. exchange or traded over-the-counter in the U.S., and the use of such borrowings must comply with the rules and regulations issued by authorities such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. For more detailed information about short-term borrowings and long-term debt, please refer to Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Ratings Sony considers one of managements top priorities to be the maintenance of stable and appropriate credit ratings in order to ensure financial flexibility for liquidity and capital management and continued adequate access to sufficient funding resources in the financial and capital markets. In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Sony obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Rating Services (S&P). In addition, Sony maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital market. Sonys current debt ratings from each agency as of June 2, 2008 are noted below: Moodys S&P R&I Long-term debt A2 (Outlook: Positive) A- (Outlook: Stable) AA- (Outlook: Stable) Short-term debt P-1 A-2 a-1+ 69 Table of Contents Cash Management Sony is centralizing and working to make more efficient its global cash management activities through SGTS. The excess or shortage of cash at most of Sonys subsidiaries is invested or funded by SGTS on a net basis, although Sony recognizes that fund transfers are limited in certain countries and geographical areas due to restrictions on capital transactions. In order to pursue more efficient cash management and in the event of surplus capital generation among Sonys subsidiaries, uneven cash distribution is managed directly or indirectly through SGTS so that Sony can reduce unnecessary cash and cash equivalents and borrowings. Financial Services segment In the Financial Services segment, the management of SFH, Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank recognize the importance of securing sufficient liquidity to cover the payment of obligations that they incur in the ordinary course of business, and these companies abide by the regulations imposed by regulatory authorities and establish and operate under company guidelines that comply with these regulations. Their purpose in doing so is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and secure sufficient means to pay their obligations. For instance, cash inflows for Sony Life and Sony Assurance come mainly from policyholders insurance premiums and Sony Life and Sony Assurance keep sufficient liquidity in the form of investments primarily in various securities. Sony Bank, on the other hand, uses its cash inflows, which come mainly from customers deposits in local or foreign currencies, in order to offer mortgage loans to individuals or to make bond investments, and establish a necessary level of liquidity for the smooth settlement of transactions. Sony Life currently obtains ratings from five rating agencies: A+ by S&P for insurer financial strength rating, Aa3 by Moodys for insurance financial strength rating, A+ by AM Best Company Inc. for financial strength rating, AA by R&I for insurance claims paying ability and AA by the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. for ability to pay insurance claims. Sony Bank obtained an A- rating from S&P for its long-term local/foreign currency issuer ratings and an A-2 rating from S&P for its short-term local/foreign currency issuer rating. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT It is necessary for Sony to continue technological innovation in order to maintain group-wide growth. Sony believes that technology made possible by our research and development activities is key to the differentiation of products in existing businesses and the source of creating value in new businesses. Research and development is focused in four key domains: a common development platform technology for home and mobile electronics, and semiconductor, device, and software technologies which are essential for product differentiation and for creating value-added products. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased 23.4 billion yen, or 4.3 percent, to 520.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) decreased from 7.1 percent to 6.3 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment decreased 1.6 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 438.7 billion yen and expenses in the Game segment decreased 20.8 billion yen, or 21.2 percent, to 77.1 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 65 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 35 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications and displays. In the Game segment, research and development costs decreased mainly due to the decline in costs related to PS3. Consolidated research and development costs for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 are expected to increase by 4 percent to 540 billion yen. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased 12.1 billion yen, or 2.3 percent, to 543.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) decreased from 7.8 percent to 7.1 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment increased 22.2 billion yen, or 5.3 percent, to 440.4 billion yen, whereas expenses in the Game segment decreased 10.8 billion yen, or 9.9 percent, to 97.9 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 70 Table of Contents 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications and displays. In the Game segment, research and development costs decreased mainly due to the completion of most of PS3s research and development phase. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 29.8 billion yen, or 5.9 percent, to 531.8 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes financial service revenue) increased from 7.5 percent to 7.8 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment decreased 15.2 billion yen, or 3.5 percent, to 418.1 billion yen, whereas expenses in the Game segment increased 40.2 billion yen, or 58.7 percent, to 108.7 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 64 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 36 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. In addition, within the Game segment, there was an increase primarily of hardware-related research and development costs associated with PS3. TREND INFORMATION This section contains forward-looking statements about the possible future performance of Sony and should be read in light of the cautionary statement on that subject, which appears on the inside front cover page and applies to this entire document. Issues Facing Sony and Managements Response to those Issues Below is a description of the issues management believes each segment continues to face and an explanation as to how each segment is approaching those issues. Electronics Although the Electronics segment continues to hold a very strong position in the worldwide consumer audio visual products market, that position has become increasingly threatened as a result of the entrance of new manufacturers and distributors. These new entrants are threatening Sonys position due to the industry shift from analog to digital technology. In the analog era, complicated functionality of electronics products was made possible through the combination of several complex parts, and Sony held a competitive advantage in the design and manufacture of those parts as a result of its accumulated expertise. In the digital era, however, complicated functionality has become concentrated in semiconductors and other key digital devices. Since these semiconductors and key devices can be mass produced, they have become readily available to new market entrants, and the functionality that once commanded a high premium has become more affordable. This has led to intense price erosion in the consumer audio visual products market. Also, Sony is exposed to the pressure of declines in selling prices as a result of a concentration of market share among a limited number of dealers and retailers. To respond to these challenges, Sony is striving to keep pace with price erosion by reducing its manufacturing and other costs. It is seeking to maintain the premium pricing it enjoys on many of its end-user products by adding functionality to those products and developing new applications and uses that appeal to the consumer. In addition, it is taking steps to increase its competitive edge by developing high value-added semiconductors and other key digital devices in-house. Sony considers improving the profitability of the television business, which recorded a loss in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, as the most pressing issue facing the Electronics segment. As such during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony decided to exit the CRT television and LCD rear-projection television businesses due to the shrinking market for these products, and concentrate management resources on the LCD television business. In order to improve profitability in the LCD television business, Sony will continue cost reduction plans through the standardization of panels and chassis and the reduction in the number of components used in production. In addition, Sony is targeting unit sales growth exceeding that of the market by continuing to focus on large-size and high value-added models, while at the same time expanding the line-up of lower priced models and actively developing emerging markets. 71 Table of Contents In anticipation of an increase in unit sales of LCD televisions, Sony recognizes the importance of a stable supply of LCD panels. S-LCD, Sonys joint venture with Samsung, which is based in South Korea, started its 7th generation amorphous TFT LCD panel production line operation in April 2005 and has a current production capacity of 120,000 substrates of mother glass per month. S-LCD also started its 8th generation amorphous TFT LCD panel production line operation in August 2007 and has a current production capacity of 50,000 substrates per month. Furthermore, S-LCD plans to construct a new 8th generation LCD panel production line and start production during the second quarter of calendar year 2009 with an initial production capacity of 60,000 substrates per month. Also, Sony, together with Sharp Corporation (Sharp), signed a non-binding memorandum of intent in February 2008 to establish a joint venture to manufacture amorphous TFT LCD panels and modules on a 10th generation production line. Sony and Sharp aim to enter into legally binding joint venture documentation by September 30, 2008. Production capacity is planned to be 72,000 substrates per month. Sony plans to receive a supply of 50 percent of the LCD panels produced by S-LCD and 34 percent of the LCD panels produced by the joint venture with Sharp. Sony has reviewed its investment policy in the semiconductor business. In the future, Sony will carefully select investments and adopt a strategy to more clearly focus on the CCDs and CMOS image sensors and television- and video-related businesses. As part of this strategy, in March 2008, Sony sold to Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) production equipment for high-performance semiconductors such as the Cell Broadband Enginetm processor and the RSX graphics engine for PS3, installed in the Nagasaki Technology Center of Sony Semiconductor Kyushu Corporation. Nagasaki Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation was established by Toshiba, Sony and Sony Computer Entertainment and commenced operations on April 1, 2008 to produce such high-performance semiconductors with the above-mentioned production equipment made available to the joint venture by Toshiba. In addition, on March 31, 2008, upon the expiration of their contract, Sony and Toshiba terminated Oita TS Semiconductor Corporation, a manufacturing joint venture located within Toshibas Oita Operations. Following the termination of the joint venture, Sony sold the related manufacturing equipment to Toshiba on April 1, 2008. Game In the Game segment, Sony will continue to strive to significantly improve the profitability of the PS3 business through an enhanced line-up of software, expansion of the platform and hardware cost reductions. At the same time, in order to expand the business domain of PS3, Sony will actively engage in the upgrade and expansion of networked service and content. As for PS2, which is in its ninth year since release, Sony expects a decrease in unit sales volume, including hardware and software, in comparison to the previous fiscal year. However, on the back of worldwide hardware expansion, there are plans for a diversified portfolio of software titles to be released, and, thus, Sony will strive to maintain the scale of this business. In addition, Sony will promote the further expansion of the PSP platform, for which hardware unit sales increased significantly compared to the previous fiscal year, by improving the breadth of software titles, functionality and services in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009. Pictures In the Pictures segment, Sony faces intense competition, rising expenses, including advertising and promotion expenses, and a growing trend toward digital piracy. In addition, the DVD format is 11 years old and is showing signs of maturation. To meet these challenges, Sony is working to produce and acquire a diversified portfolio of motion pictures with broad worldwide appeal for distribution including those existing and new home entertainment formats, such as Blu-ray, and other emerging platforms, including digital download. Financial Services In the Financial Services segment, the value of assets accumulated by businesses has grown continuously over the past several years, resulting in a large portion (approximately 45 percent as of March 31, 2008) of Sonys total assets being accounted for by the Financial Services segment. To strengthen asset management and risk management in parallel with this growing asset value, enhance disclosure of business details, and offer customers integrated financial services tailored to their individual needs, Sony established SFH in April 2004. SFH functions as a holding company overseeing Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank, with the aim of increasing the synergies among these businesses. 72 Table of Contents Sony is confronted by changes in the financial services industry as a result of the deregulation and liberalization of additional insurance premiums, postal privatization, the complete lifting of the ban on the sale of insurance products by banks, and the lifting of the ban on the securities intermediary services by banks and others. Sony also faces macroeconomic challenges including Japans declining population, low birthrate and growing proportion of elderly citizens. In response to this changing environment, each of Sonys financial services businesses, which are latecomers to the life insurance, non-life insurance and banking industries, make use of distinctive, individual industry-specific business models and plan to achieve further business expansion and even higher levels of customer satisfaction. On October 11, 2007, in conjunction with the global initial public offering of shares of SFH, the shares of SFH were listed for trading on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This offering aimed to achieve the efficient redistribution of management resources within Sony Group as a whole, and establish SFHs self financing, which is necessary for the further expansion of its financial businesses and independent growth. Following this global offering, SFH remains a consolidated subsidiary with Sony Corporation as the majority shareholder, holding 60 percent of shares issued by SFH. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Sony evaluates its estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Sony considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to its financial condition and results, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Sony believes that the following represent its critical accounting policies. Investments Sonys investments are comprised of debt and equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity method of accounting. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings. Sony regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of credit condition of the issuers, sovereign risk, and whether or not Sony is able to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities whose fair values are readily determinable, Sony presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally for a period of up to six months). This criterion is employed as a threshold to identify securities that may have a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of positive factors that overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is less than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors that may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary is often subjective in nature and involves certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected operating results, business plans and 73 Table of Contents future cash flows of the issuer of the security. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that Sony currently believes to be temporary may be determined to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of additional information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in value of worldwide equity markets and the effect of worldwide interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized and reduce income in future periods. Valuation of inventory Sony values its inventory based on the lower of cost or market. Sony writes down inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value  i.e., less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal. However, if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected and further price decreases are needed, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Additionally, as Sony evaluates its manufacturing cost in yen while it sets its sales prices in euros and U.S. dollars for some products, Sonys results may be negatively impacted by future exchange rate fluctuations. Impairment of long-lived assets Sony reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. This review is performed using estimates of future cash flows by product category (e.g. CRT TV display) or entity (e.g. entertainment complex in the U.S.). If the carrying value of the asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of those long-lived assets. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 59,762 million yen, which included 25,506 million yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in the U.S. in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. The impairment charge also included 8,522 million yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of Sonys entertainment complex to be held for sale in the U.S. in connection with restructuring activities of non-core businesses in All Other. The impairment charge was based on the negotiated sales price of the complex. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 16,762 million yen, which included 3,572 million yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in the U.S., East Asia and Southeast Asia in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 19,413 million yen, which included 6,457 million for impairment of long-lived assets of LCD rear-projection television manufacturing facilities to be held and used worldwide in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and the assets are also tested between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying amount. Such an event would include unfavorable variances from 74 Table of Contents established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, which are periodically reviewed by Sonys management. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit (Sonys operating segments or one level below the operating segments) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. In its impairment review, Sony performs internal valuation analyses or utilizes third-party valuations when management believes it to be appropriate, and considers other market information that is publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations, which may result in Sony recognizing impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment analysis, Sony applied a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. As of March 31, 2008, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in a material impact on the statement of income. Pension benefits costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on certain assumptions including discount rates, retirement rates and mortality rates, which are based upon current statistical data, as well as expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and other factors. Specifically, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets are two critical assumptions in the determination of periodic pension costs and pension liabilities. Assumptions are evaluated at least annually, or at the time when events occur or circumstances change and these events or changes could have a significant effect on these critical assumptions. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Therefore, actual results generally affect recognized costs and the recorded obligations for pensions in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys pension obligations and future costs. Sonys principal pension plans are its Japanese pension plans. Foreign pension plans are not significant individually, to total plan assets and pension obligations. 75 Table of Contents To determine the benefit obligation of the Japanese pension plans, Sony used a discount rate of 2.3 percent for its Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2008. The discount rate was determined by using currently available information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit obligation in consideration of amounts and timing of cash outflows for expected benefit payments. Such available information about rates of returns is collected from Bloomberg and credit rating agencies. The 2.3 percent discount rate remains unchanged from fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and reflects current market interest rate conditions. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Sony considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on various categories of plan assets. For Japanese pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 3.7 percent and 4.0 percent as of March 31, 2007 and 2008 respectively. The actual loss on pension plan assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was 8.5 percent. Actual results that differ from the expected return on plan assets are accumulated and amortized as a component of pension costs over the average future service period, thereby reducing the year-to-year volatility in pension costs. As of March 31, 2007 and 2008, Sony had net actuarial losses of 200.6 billion yen and 242.1 billion yen, respectively, including losses related to plan assets. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the net actuarial loss increased due to the difference between the actual rate of return on pension plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The net actuarial loss reflects the overall unfavorable return on investment over the past several years and will result in an increase in pension costs as they are recognized. Sony adopted FAS No. 158 in the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2007. As a result, Sony recorded a pension liability adjustment for the prior service cost, net actuarial loss and obligation existing at transition totaling 9.5 billion yen as of March 31, 2007. This adjustment was established by a charge to stockholders equity, resulting in no impact to the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Sonys pension and severance plans. The following table illustrates the effect of changes in the discount rate and the expected return on pension plan assets, while holding all other assumptions constant, for Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2008. Pre-Tax Pension Equity Change in Assumption PBO Costs (Net of Tax) (Yen in billions) 25 basis point increase / decrease in discount rate −/+25.4 −/+2.0 +/−1.2 25 basis point increase / decrease in expected return on assets  −/+1.2 +/−0.7 Stock-based compensation Sony accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value based method. Fair value is measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Sony estimates the forfeiture rate based on its historical experience for the stock acquisition rights plans, and recognizes this compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, only for the stock acquisition rights expected to vest over the requisite service period. The expense is primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the expected life of each award. In addition, judgment is also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those rights expected to vest. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable; however, if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. 76 Table of Contents Deferred tax asset valuation Sony records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, Sony considers all currently available evidence for future years, both positive and negative, supplemented by information of historical results and future earning plans along with tax planning strategies and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences for each tax jurisdiction. Sony also considers its ability to utilize operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration in each tax jurisdiction. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in Sonys approved forecasts of future operations. However, if Sony is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, Sony could be required to reduce the amount of its deferred tax assets or increase its valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on future operating results. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets, less valuation allowance, will be realized. Although Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI), Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. (SCEA) and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited (SCEE) have recorded cumulative losses in recent years, Sony concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that SCEIs, SCEAs and SCEEs deferred tax assets will be fully realized based on the consideration of both positive and negative evidence, including the Game segments projected income from operating activities and the existence of qualifying tax-planning strategies. Film accounting An aspect of film accounting that requires the exercise of judgment relates to the process of estimating the total revenues to be received throughout a films life cycle. Such estimate of a films ultimate revenue is important for two reasons. First, while a film is being produced and the related costs are being capitalized, it is necessary for management to estimate the ultimate revenue, less additional costs to be incurred, including exploitation costs which are expensed as incurred, in order to determine whether the value of a film has been impaired and thus requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film costs. Second, the amount of film costs recognized as cost of sales for a given film as it is exhibited in various markets throughout its life cycle is based upon the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to the estimated ultimate total revenues. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on several factors including the historical performance of similar genre films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses, the expected number of theaters at which the film will be released, anticipated performance in the home entertainment, television and other ancillary markets, and agreements for future sales. Management updates such estimates based on the actual results to date for each film. For example, a film that has resulted in lower than expected theatrical revenues in its initial weeks of release would generally have its theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution ultimate revenues adjusted downward; a failure to do so would result in the understatement of amortized film costs for the period. Future insurance policy benefits Liabilities for future insurance policy benefits are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force. These liabilities are computed by the net level premium method based upon estimates as to future investment yield, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals and other factors. Future policy benefits are computed using interest rates ranging from 1.00 percent to 4.90 percent. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on either the subsidiarys own experience or various actuarial tables. Generally these assumptions are locked-in upon the issuance of new insurance. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys future insurance policy benefits. Equity in net income of affiliated companies Sony periodically reviews the presentation of its financial information to ensure that it is consistent with the way management views the consolidated operations. Since Sony considers its equity investments to be integral to its 77 Table of Contents operations, effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, Sony will report equity in earnings of affiliated companies as a component of operating income. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts In September 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued the Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts. SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in FAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sales of Investments. Sony adopted SOP 05-1 on April 1, 2007. The adoption of SOP 05-1 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Accounting for servicing of financial assets In March 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This statement amends FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. Sony adopted FAS No. 156 on April 1, 2007. The adoption of FAS No. 156 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Effective April 1, 2007, Sony adopted the provision of FIN No. 48. As a result of the adoption, a charge against beginning retained earnings totaling 4,452 million yen was recorded. As of April 1, 2007, the total unrecognized tax benefits were 223,857 million yen, of which 129,632 million yen, if recognized, would affect Sonys effective tax rate. How taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement. EITF Issue No. 06-3 requires disclosure of the accounting policy for any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is imposed concurrently on a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer. Sony adopted EITF Issue No. 06-3 on April 1, 2007. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 06-3 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations. RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS Fair value measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair 78 Table of Contents value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 will be effective for Sony beginning April 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) FAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 and FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. FSP FAS 157-1 removes certain leasing transactions from the scope of FAS No. 157. FSP FAS 157-2 partially delays the effective date of FAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of FAS No. 157 as it relates to financial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys consolidated results of operations and financial position. Sony is currently evaluating the impact for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. FAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. FAS No. 159 is required to be adopted by Sony in the first quarter beginning April 1, 2008. The adoption of FAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys consolidated results of operations and financial position. However, its effects on future periods will depend on the nature of instruments held by Sony and its elections under the provisions of FAS No. 159. Business combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. FAS No. 141(R) requires that the acquisition method of accounting be applied to a broader range of business combinations, amends the definition of a business combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an acquirer to recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition date and requires the assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. Sony will adopt FAS No. 141(R) as of April 1, 2009, and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of any acquisitions subject to FAS No. 141(R). Noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. FAS No. 160 requires that the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the transition provisions of FAS No. 160, Sony will adopt the statement as of April 1, 2009, via retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure requirements. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS No. 160. Disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. FAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosures required by FAS No. 133 to provide more information about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS No. 133 and its interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Sony is currently evaluating the additional disclosures required by FAS No. 161. 79 Table of Contents The hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles In May 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. FAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. FAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS No. 162. Financial guarantee insurance contracts In May 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 163, Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts. FAS No. 163 clarifies how FAS No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises, applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises, including the recognition and measurement of premium revenue and claim liabilities. It also requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts. FAS No. 163 will be effective for Sony as of April 1, 2009, except for disclosures about the insurance enterprises risk-management activities. Disclosures about the insurance enterprises risk-management activities will be effective the first period beginning after issuance of FAS No. 163. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS No. 163. Item 6.

Also, as a part of Sonys incentive compensation arrangements, Sony Corporation issued stock acquisition rights during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. The stock acquisition rights, which represent rights to subscribe for shares of common stock of Sony Corporation, have been granted to the Directors, Corporate Executive Officers, Corporate Executives, Group Executives, and selected employees.

The aggregate number of points granted to participating Directors and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2008, as a group (15 people) totaled 77,275 points. Board Practices Sony has adopted a Company with Committees corporate governance system under the Japanese Company Law (Kaishaho) and related legislation (collectively the Company Law). Under this system, Sony Corporation has three committees: the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Under the Company Law, each committee is required to consist of not less than three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. Under the committee system, Directors as such have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except for limited circumstances as permitted by law. The Board of Directors must elect Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko-yaku), who are responsible for the execution of the business of Sony Corporation. A summary of the governance system adopted by Sony Corporation is set forth below. The Board of Directors determines fundamental management policy and other important matters related to the management of Sony and oversees the performance of the duties of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has the power and authority to appoint and dismiss the members of the above-mentioned three committees and Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Company Law, all Directors must be elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders from the candidates determined by the Nominating Committee. Under the Company Law, the term of office of Directors expires at the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. Directors may serve any number of consecutive terms although, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, outside Directors may not be reelected more than five times without the consent of all Directors. The Nominating Committee, which pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation consists of five or more Directors, determines the content of proposals to be submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors. As stated above, under the Company Law, a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee must be outside Directors. In order to qualify as an outside Director under the Company Law, a Director must be a person (i) who is not a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who has never been a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, at least two members of the Nominating Committee must concurrently be Corporate Executive Officers. The Nominating Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 20, 2008: Yotaro Kobayashi, who is the Chair of the Nominating Committee and an outside Director; Yoshihiko Miyauchi, Peter Bonfield, Fujio Cho, Yukako Uchinaga and Roland A. Hernandez who are each outside Directors; and Howard Stringer and Ryoji Chubachi, who are Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, the Audit Committee must consist of three or more Directors, a majority of whom, as stated above, must be outside Directors. In addition, under the Company Law, a member of the Audit Committee may not concurrently be a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Further, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, members of the Audit Committee must meet the independence and other equivalent requirements of U.S. securities laws and regulations to the extent applicable to Sony Corporation. The Audit Committees primary responsibility is to review the consolidated and non-consolidated financial statements and business reports to be submitted by the Board of Directors at the General Meeting of Shareholders; to monitor the performance of duties by Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (with respect to the preparation process of financial statements, 87 Table of Contents disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls, compliance structure, risk management structure, internal audit structure, internal hotline system and other matters), in each case pursuant to the Company Law; and to propose appointment/dismissal or non-reappointment of, approve the compensation of, and oversee and evaluate the work of Sonys independent auditor. Under the Company Law, the Audit Committee has a statutory duty to prepare and submit each year its audit report to the Corporate Executive Officer designated by the Board of Directors. A member of the Audit Committee may note his or her opinion in the audit report if it is different from the opinion of the Audit Committee that is expressed in the audit report. The Audit Committee discusses with Sony Corporations independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, the scope and results of audits by the independent auditor including their evaluation of Sony Corporations internal controls, compatibility with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., and the overall quality of financial reporting. The Audit Committee makes an assessment of the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata by overseeing their activities through regular communications and discussions with them, and by pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be provided. The Audit Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 20, 2008: Yoshiaki Yamauchi, who is the Chair of the Audit Committee and an outside Director; and Fueo Sumita and Ryuji Yasuda, who are also outside Directors. Both Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Fueo Sumita are audit committee financial experts within the meaning of Item 16A of this report. As required by the Company Law, the Compensation Committee determines the policy and the content of compensation, bonus and any other benefits (including equity-related rights or options given for the purpose of stock incentive options) to be received by each Director and Corporate Executive Officer in consideration of the execution of their duties. In addition to such statutory duties, the Compensation Committee sets policy on the composition of individual compensation to be received by other senior management of Sony Group (Directors or other officers of Sony Group companies whose appointment is subject to approval by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Sony Corporation), and also submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the issuance of stock acquisition rights for the purpose of granting stock options and other forms of stock price-based compensation utilizing shares etc. of Sony Group, as individual compensation to the aforementioned senior management. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee shall consist of three or more Directors, and as a general rule, at least one member shall concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officer; provided, however, that a Director who is the CEO or the COO (Chief Operating Officer) of Sony Group or in any equivalent position shall not be a member of the Compensation Committee. As stated above, a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee must be outside Directors. The Compensation Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 20, 2008: Sakie T. Fukushima, who is the Chair of the Compensation Committee and an outside Director; Mitsuaki Yahagi and Tsun-yan Hsieh who are also outside Directors. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the Board of Directors convened nine times. The Nominating Committee met five times, the Audit Committee met 15 times and the Compensation Committee met five times. All 11 outside Directors participated in all meetings of the Board of Directors held during his/her tenure period of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 except for Mr. Yoshihiko Miyauchi, Mr. Fujio Cho, and Mr. Ned Lautenbach. (Mr. Yoshihiko Miyauchi participated in seven meetings out of nine; Mr. Fujio Cho participated in eight meetings out of nine; Mr. Ned Lautenbach participated in two meetings out of five and resigned from his post on September 4, 2007.) Also, all 10 outside Directors who are members of Committees participated in at least 75 percent of the aggregate number of meetings of each Committee held during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. All four outside Directors who are members of the Audit Committee participated in all meetings of the Audit Committee held during his/her tenure period of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 except for Mr. Ryuji Yasuda. (Mr. Ryuji Yasuda participated in nine meetings out of eleven.) No Directors have service contracts with Sony providing for benefits upon termination of service as a Director. Under the Company Law and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, exempt Directors from liabilities to Sony Corporation to the extent permitted by law arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties. Also, in accordance with the Company Law and its Articles of Incorporation, Sony Corporation has entered into a liability limitation agreement with each outside Director that limits the maximum amount of liabilities owed by each outside Director to Sony Corporation 88 Table of Contents arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties to the greater of either 30 million yen or an amount equal to the aggregate sum of the amounts prescribed in each item of Article 425, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law. The Board of Directors must appoint one or more Corporate Executive Officers who are authorized to determine matters delegated to them by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Executive Officers are responsible for conducting all the business operations of Sony within the scope of authority delegated by the Board of Directors. As of June 20, 2008, there are 7 Corporate Executive Officers, some of whom are also Directors. Significant decision-making authority has been delegated to the CEO and also to each Corporate Executive Officer with respect to investments, strategic alliances and other actions related to the execution of business operations. Sony Corporation believes that this significant delegation enables Sony to be managed in a dynamic and responsive manner. The terms of office of Corporate Executive Officers must expire at the conclusion of the first meeting of the Board of Directors held immediately after the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. From among the Corporate Executive Officers who as a general rule are also Directors, the Board of Directors shall elect Representative Corporate Executive Officers. Each Representative Corporate Executive Officer has the statutory authority to represent Sony Corporation in the conduct of its affairs. (Reference) At a Board meeting held on April 26, 2006, the Board of Directors reaffirmed the existing internal control and governance framework and determined to continue to evaluate and improve such framework going forward, as appropriate. This determination was required by and met the requirements of the Company Law. Details of the determination are posted on the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/control.html For an explanation as to the significant differences between the New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance standards and Sonys corporate governance practices, please visit Sonys website at: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/NYSEGovernance.html Employees As of March 31, 2008, Sony had approximately 180,500 employees, an increase of approximately 17,500 employees from March 31, 2007. The total number of employees increased as a result of a significant increase of employees at manufacturing sites in East Asia and East Europe with an expansion of business in the Electronics segment. As of March 31, 2008, approximately 61,000 employees were located in Japan and approximately 119,500 employees were located outside Japan. Approximately 28 percent of the total number of employees were members of labor unions. As of March 31, 2007, Sony had approximately 163,000 employees, an increase of approximately 4,500 employees from March 31, 2006. Although there was a reduction in the number of employees associated with the deconsolidation of StylingLife Holdings Inc. (StylingLife) and restructuring at a number of manufacturing facilities, the total number of employees increased as a result of a significant increase at manufacturing facilities in East Asia. As of March 31, 2007, approximately 59,100 employees were located in Japan and approximately 103,900 employees were located outside Japan. Approximately 24 percent of the total number of employees were members of labor unions. 89 Table of Contents The following table shows the number of employees by segment as of March 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008.

Sony generally considers its labor relations to be good. In Japan, Sony Corporation and several subsidiaries have labor unions. Regarding labor relations in the Electronics segment by area, in Asia, where Sony owns many manufacturing sites, a few of these sites have labor unions that have union contracts. In China, most employees are members of the labor unions. In the U.S., no manufacturing sites have labor unions. In Mexico, one manufacturing site has a labor union that has a union contract, but labor relations are good and there have been no significant problems in renegotiating the contract. In Europe, Sony maintains good labor relations with the Work Councils in each country, and, while some employees belong to unions, they are not eligible for union contracts. In the Pictures segment, Sony also generally considers its labor relations to be good. A number of Pictures subsidiaries are signatories to union contracts. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, negotiations of new three-year agreements with the following unions and guilds were successfully concluded: Teamsters Local 399 (Teamsters); International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 40; United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry Local 78; Studio Utility Employees Local 724; Plasterers Local 755; Directors Guild of America; and Writers Guild of America.

In March 2008, upon the expiration of the contract, Sony and Toshiba terminated the OTSS joint venture. As of March 31, 2008, Sony held notes and accounts receivable, trade due from Sony Ericsson and Kyoshin worth 25.1 billion yen and 6.2 billion yen, respectively, in addition to notes and accounts payable, trade due to S-LCD and OTSS totaling 31.4 billion yen and 15.4 billion yen, respectively. Sony held advances to SONY BMG worth 0.2 billion yen. Because of the size of these transactions, Sony does not consider the amounts involved to be material to its business.

Interests of Experts and Counsel Not Applicable Item 8. Financial Information Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information Refer to the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Legal Proceedings On October 18, 2006, class action lawsuits were filed in California in which the plaintiffs alleged that Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation of America, Sony Electronics Inc., other named defendants, and other unnamed parties had entered into and carried out an agreement, combination, or conspiracy to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize the prices of, and allocate the market for and production of, Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). Numerous similar lawsuits were filed in various jurisdictions throughout the United States, which were consolidated in a single federal court for coordinated pre-trial proceedings (the MDL Proceeding). Sony entities reached tolling agreements with the plaintiffs counsel, pursuant to which such Sony entities were not named as defendants in the Consolidated Amended Complaint for the MDL Proceeding. Also there have been similar lawsuits filed in 92 Table of Contents Canada (Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario) against those Sony entities in addition to Sony of Canada Ltd. and other major SRAM manufacturers. Sony entities including Sony of Canada Ltd. entered into a tolling agreement with the plaintiffs counsel, pursuant to which plaintiffs withdrew their claim against all such Sony entities in the Ontario proceeding in March 2008, and are expected to do so in the provinces in the near future. Also, in October 2006, Sony Electronics Inc. received a Grand Jury subpoena related to a Department of Justice investigation of potential antitrust violations in the SRAM industry. Sony continues to cooperate fully with the investigation. In March 2007, Sony France S.A., Sony Europe Holding B.V., and Sony Corporation received a Statement of Objections issued by the European Commission following inspections carried out in 2002. The Statement of Objections alleged that one or more of these Sony entities entered into agreements and/or engaged in concerted practices with competing European suppliers of professional videotape in violation of Article 81 of the EC Treaty. Responses to the Statement of Objections were filed separately by each of the Sony entities in May 2007. On November 20, 2007, the European Commission rendered a decision fining Sony Corporation, Sony France S.A. and Sony Europe Holding B.V. 47.19 million euros for engaging in conduct found to have infringed European antitrust rules in the professional videotape market in Europe between 1999 and 2002. The Sony entities did not appeal that decision to the European Court of First Instance and paid the fine in accordance with the decision. In addition, Sony Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants or otherwise involved in several other pending legal and regulatory proceedings. However, based upon the information currently available to Sony, management of Sony believes that the outcome from such legal and regulatory proceedings, if any, would not have a material effect on Sonys consolidated financial results and condition. Dividend Policy Sony believes that continuously increasing corporate value and providing dividends are essential to rewarding shareholders. It is Sonys policy to utilize retained earnings, after ensuring the perpetuation of stable dividends, to carry out various investments that contribute to an increase in corporate value such as those that ensure future growth and strengthen competitiveness. A fiscal year-end cash dividend of 12.5 yen per share of Sony Corporation Common Stock was approved at the Board of Directors meeting held on May 14, 2008 and was paid on June 2, 2008. Sony Corporation has already paid an interim dividend for Common Stock of 12.5 yen per share to each shareholder; accordingly, the total annual cash dividend per share of Common Stock is 25.0 yen. In regards to the annual dividend for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, upon careful consideration of Sonys results in that fiscal year and other factors, Sony Corporation plans to increase its regular dividend per share by 15 yen to 40 yen per annum. Sony Corporation also plans to distribute a special cash dividend of 10 yen per share as part of the interim dividend, which would be paid in December 2008. This special dividend would reward our shareholders for the successful global initial public offering of shares of SFH and be in appreciation of their support during the implementation of our three-year restructuring program and other corporate initiatives which resulted in record consolidated net income during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. As a result, Sony Corporation plans to pay a total annual dividend for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 of 50 yen per share, comprising an interim dividend of 30 yen per share and a year-end dividend of 20 yen per share. Significant Changes No significant change has occurred since the date of the annual financial statements included in this annual report. Item 9.

Selling Shareholders Not Applicable Dilution Not Applicable 95 Table of Contents Expenses of the Issue Not Applicable Item 10. Additional Information Share Capital Not Applicable Memorandum and Articles of Association Organization Sony Corporation is a joint stock corporation (Kabushiki Kaisha) incorporated in Japan under the Company Law (Kaishaho) of Japan. It is registered in the Commercial Register (Shogyo Tokibo) maintained by the Minato Branch Office of the Tokyo Bureau of Legal Affairs. Objects and purposes The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that its purpose is to engage in the following business activities: (i) manufacture and sale of electronic and electrical machines and equipment, medical instruments, optical instruments and other equipment, machines and instruments; (ii) planning, production and sale of audio-visual software and computer software programs; (iii) manufacture and sale of metal industrial products, chemical industrial products and ceramic industrial products, textile products, paper products and wood-crafted articles, daily necessities, foodstuffs and toys, transportation machines, equipment, petroleum and coal products; (iv) real estate activities, construction business, transportation business and warehousing business; (v) publishing business and printing business; (vi) advertising agency business, insurance agency business, broadcasting enterprise, recreation business such as travel, management of sporting facilities, etc. and other service enterprises; (vii) financial business; (viii) Type I and Type II telecommunications business under the Telecommunications Business Law; (ix) investing in stocks and bonds, etc.; (x) manufacture, sale, export and import of products which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above; (xi) rendering of services related to those mentioned above; (xii) investment in businesses mentioned above operated by other companies or persons; and (xiii) all businesses which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above. Directors Under the Company Law, Directors have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except in limited circumstances as permitted by law. If a Director also serves concurrently as a Corporate Executive Officer, then he or she can execute the business of Sony Corporation in the capacity of Corporate Executive Officer. Under the Company Law, Directors must refrain from engaging in any business competing with Sony Corporation unless approved by the Board of Directors, and any Director who has a material interest in the subject matter of a resolution to be taken by the Board of Directors cannot vote on such resolution. The amount of remuneration to each Director is determined by the Compensation Committee, which consists of Directors, the majority of whom are outside 96 Table of Contents Directors (Refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees). No member of the Compensation Committee may vote on a resolution with respect to his or her own compensation as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Neither the Company Law nor Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation make a special provision as to the borrowing powers exercisable by Directors (subject to requisite internal authorizations as required by the Company Law), their retirement age, or a requirement to hold any shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. For more information on Directors, refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees. Capital stock (General) Unless indicated otherwise, set forth below is information relating to Sony Corporations capital stock, including brief summaries of the relevant provisions of Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation and Share Handling Regulations, as currently in effect, and of the Company Law and related legislation. All issued shares are fully-paid and non-assessable, and are in registered form. Transfer of shares is effected by delivery of share certificates, but in order to assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation, a shareholder must, except as set forth below, have its name and address registered on Sony Corporations register of shareholders, in accordance with Sony Corporations Share Handling Regulations. The registered beneficial holder of deposited shares underlying the American Depositary Shares (ADSs) is the Depositary for the ADSs. Accordingly, holders of ADSs will not be able to directly assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation is the transfer agent for Sony Corporations capital stock. As such, it keeps Sony Corporations registers of shareholders and beneficial shareholders in its office at 4-5, Marunouchi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo and records transfers of shares upon presentation of the certificates representing the transferred shares. A holder of shares may choose, at its discretion, to participate in the central clearing system for share certificates under the Law Concerning Central Clearing of Share Certificates and Other Securities of Japan. Participating shareholders must deposit certificates representing all of the shares to be included in this clearing system with Japan Securities Depository Center, Inc. (JASDEC). If a holder is not a participating institution in JASDEC, it must participate through a participating institution, such as a securities company or bank having a clearing account with JASDEC. All shares deposited with JASDEC will be registered in the name of JASDEC on Sony Corporations register of shareholders. Each participating shareholder will in turn be registered on Sony Corporations register of beneficial shareholders and be treated in the same way as shareholders registered on Sony Corporations register of shareholders. Entry of the share transfer in the book maintained by JASDEC for participating institutions, or in the book maintained by a participating institution for its customers, has the same effect as delivery of share certificates. The registered beneficial shareholders may exercise the rights attached to the shares, such as voting rights, and will receive dividends (if any) and notices to shareholders directly from Sony Corporation. The shares held by a person as a registered shareholder and those held by the same person as a registered beneficial shareholder are aggregated for these purposes. Beneficial owners may at any time withdraw their shares from deposit and receive share certificates. A law to establish a new central clearing system for shares of listed companies and to eliminate the issuance and use of certificates for such shares was promulgated in June 2004 and the relevant part of the law will come into effect within five years of the date of the promulgation. Currently, the effective date has not yet been determined but is expected to be January 5, 2009. On the effective date, a new central clearing system will be established and the shares of all Japanese companies listed on any Japanese stock exchange, including the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation, will be subject to the new central clearing system. On the same day, Sony Corporation will be deemed to become a company which shall not issue share certificates for its shares and all existing share certificates will become null and void. Thereafter, the transfer of such shares will be effected through entry in the records maintained under the new central clearing system. Only shares deposited with JASDEC will be immediately 97 Table of Contents transferable under the new central clearing system. Upon the effective date, any requirement, reference and discussion relating to share certificates included in this section Capital stock will not be applicable. (Authorized capital) Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may only issue shares of Common Stock. Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide that the total number of shares authorized to be issued by Sony Corporation is 3.6 billion shares. All shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation have no par value. (Distribution of Surplus) Distribution of Surplus  General Under the Company Law, distributions of cash or other assets by joint stock corporations to their shareholders, so called dividends, are referred to as distributions of Surplus (Surplus is defined in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus). Sony Corporation may make distributions of Surplus to shareholders any number of times per business year, subject to certain limitations described in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Distributions of Surplus are required in principle to be authorized by a resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders, but Sony Corporation may authorize distributions of Surplus by a resolution of the Board of Directors as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. Distributions of Surplus may be made in cash or in kind in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder. A resolution of the Board of Directors or a General Meeting of Shareholders authorizing a distribution of Surplus must specify the kind and aggregate book value of the assets to be distributed, the manner of allocation of such assets to shareholders, and the effective date of the distribution. If a distribution of Surplus is to be made in kind, Sony Corporation may, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) a General Meeting of Shareholders, grant a right to the shareholders to require Sony Corporation to make such distribution in cash instead of in kind. If no such right is granted to shareholders, the relevant distribution of Surplus must be approved by a special resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders (refer to Voting Rights with respect to a special resolution). Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, year-end dividends and interim dividends may be distributed to shareholders of record as of March 31 and September 30 each year, respectively, in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder following approval by the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) the General Meeting of Shareholders. Sony Corporation is not obliged to pay any dividends unclaimed for a period of five years after the date on which they first became payable. In Japan, the ex-dividend date and the record date for dividends precede the date of determination of the amount of the dividends to be paid. The price of the shares of Common Stock generally goes ex-dividend on the third business day prior to the record date. Distribution of Surplus  Restriction on distribution of Surplus In making a distribution of Surplus, Sony Corporation must, until the sum of its additional paid-in capital and legal reserve reaches one quarter of its stated capital, set aside in its additional paid-in capital and/or legal reserve an amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of Surplus so distributed. The amount of Surplus at any given time must be calculated in accordance with the following formula: A + B + C + D − (E + F + G) In the above formula: A = the total amount of other capital surplus and other retained earnings, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year 98 Table of Contents B = (if Sony Corporation has disposed of its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the amount of the consideration for such treasury stock received by Sony Corporation less the book value thereof C = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its stated capital after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) D = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to stated capital (if any) E = (if Sony Corporation has cancelled its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the book value of such treasury stock F = (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to its shareholders after the end of the last business year) the total book value of the Surplus so distributed G = certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if Sony Corporation has reduced Surplus and increased its stated capital, additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction and (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to the shareholders after the end of the last business year) the amount set aside in additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. The aggregate book value of Surplus distributed by Sony Corporation may not exceed a prescribed distributable amount (the Distributable Amount), as calculated on the effective date of such distribution. The Distributable Amount at any given time shall be equal to the amount of Surplus less the aggregate of the followings: (a) the book value of its treasury stock; (b) the amount of consideration for any of treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation after the end of the last business year; and (c) certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if the sum of one-half of goodwill and the deferred assets exceeds the total of stated capital, additional paid-in capital and legal reserve, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year) all or certain part of such exceeding amount as calculated in accordance with ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. If Sony Corporation has become at its option a company with respect to which consolidated balance sheets should also be considered in the calculation of the Distributable Amount (renketsu haito kisei tekiyo kaisha), Sony Corporation shall further deduct from the amount of Surplus the excess amount, if any, of (x) the total amount of stockholders equity appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice over (y) the total amount of stockholders equity and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice appearing on the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year. If Sony Corporation has prepared interim financial statements as described below, and if such interim financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors or (if so required by the Company Law) by a General Meeting of Shareholders, then the Distributable Amount must be adjusted to take into account the amount of profit or loss, and the amount of consideration for any of the treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation, during the period in respect of which such interim financial statements have been prepared. Sony Corporation may prepare non-consolidated interim financial statements consisting of a balance sheet as of any date subsequent to the end of the last business year and an income statement for the period from the first day of the current business year to the date of such balance sheet. Interim financial statements so prepared by Sony Corporation must be audited by the Audit Committee and the independent auditor, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. 99 Table of Contents (Stock splits) Sony Corporation may at any time split shares in issue into a greater number of shares at the determination of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). In the event of a stock split, generally, shareholders will not be required to exchange share certificates for new share certificates, but certificates representing the additional shares resulting from the stock split will be issued to shareholders. When a stock split is to be made Sony Corporation must give public notice of the stock split, specifying the record date thereof, at least two weeks prior to such record date. (Consolidation of shares) Sony Corporation may at any time consolidate issued shares into a smaller number of shares by a special shareholders resolution (as defined in (Voting Rights)). When a consolidation of shares is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice and notice to each shareholder that, within a period of not less than one month specified in the notice, share certificates must be submitted to Sony Corporation for exchange. Sony Corporation must disclose the reason for the consolidation of shares at a General Meeting of Shareholders. (General Meeting of Shareholders) The Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of Sony Corporation for each business year is normally held in June of each year in Tokyo, Japan. In addition, Sony Corporation may hold an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders whenever necessary by giving notice thereof at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Notice of a shareholders meeting setting forth the place, time and purpose thereof must be mailed to each shareholder having voting rights (or, in the case of a non-resident shareholder, to such shareholders resident proxy or mailing address in Japan) at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Under the Company Law, such notice may be given to shareholders by electronic means, subject to obtaining consent by the relevant shareholders. The record date for an Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders is March 31 of each year. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least three percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may require the convocation of a General Meeting of Shareholders for a particular purpose. Unless such a shareholders meeting is convened promptly or a convocation notice of a meeting which is to be held not later than eight weeks from the day of such demand is dispatched, the requiring shareholder may, upon obtaining a court approval, convene such a shareholders meeting. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 300 voting rights or one percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may propose a matter to be considered at a General Meeting of Shareholders by submitting a written request to Sony Corporation at least eight weeks prior to the date set for such meeting. If the Articles of Incorporation so provide, any of the minimum voting rights or percentages, time periods and number of voting rights necessary for exercising the minority shareholder rights described above may be decreased or shortened. (Voting rights) So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, a holder of shares constituting one or more units is entitled to one vote for each such unit of stock (refer to (Unit share system) below; currently 100 shares constitute one unit), except that no voting rights with respect to shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation are afforded to Sony Corporation or any corporate or certain other entity more than one-quarter of the total voting rights of which are directly or indirectly held by Sony Corporation. If Sony Corporation eliminates from its Articles of Incorporation the provisions relating to units of stock, holders of capital stock will have one vote for each share they hold. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, a resolution can be adopted at a General Meeting of Shareholders by a majority of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting. The Company Law and Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide, however, that the quorum for the election of Directors shall not be less than one-third of the total number of voting rights of all 100 Table of Contents the shareholders. Sony Corporations shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of Directors. Shareholders may cast their votes in writing and may also exercise their voting rights through proxies, provided that the proxies are also shareholders holding voting rights. Shareholders may also exercise their voting rights by electronic means pursuant to the method designated by Sony Corporation. The Company Law and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that in order to amend the Articles of Incorporation and in certain other instances, including: (1) acquisition of its own shares from a specific party other than its subsidiaries; (2) consolidation of shares; (3) any offering of new shares at a specially favorable price (or any offering of stock acquisition rights to acquire shares of capital stock, or bonds with stock acquisition rights at specially favorable conditions) to any persons other than shareholders; (4) the exemption of liability of a Director, Corporate Executive Officer or independent auditor with certain exceptions; (5) a reduction of stated capital with certain exceptions; (6) a distribution of in-kind dividends which meets certain requirements; (7) dissolution, merger, consolidation, or corporate split with certain exceptions; (8) the transfer of the whole or a material part of the business; (9) the taking over of the whole of the business of any other corporation with certain exceptions; or (10) share exchange or share transfer for the purpose of establishing 100 percent parent-subsidiary relationships with certain exceptions, the quorum shall be one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders, and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required (the special shareholders resolutions). (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) Holders of Sony Corporations shares of capital stock have no pre-emptive rights under its Articles of Incorporation. Authorized but unissued shares may be issued at such times and upon such terms as the Board of Directors or the CEO determines, subject to the limitations as to the offering of new shares at a specially favorable price mentioned under (Voting rights) above. The Board of Directors or the CEO may, however, determine that shareholders shall be given subscription rights regarding a particular issue of new shares, in which case such rights must be given on uniform terms to all shareholders as at a record date of which not less than two weeks prior public notice must be given. Each of the shareholders to whom such rights are given must also be given notice of the expiry thereof at least two weeks prior to the date on which such rights expire. Subject to certain conditions, Sony Corporation may issue stock acquisition rights by a resolution of the Board of Directors or a determination by the CEO. Holders of stock acquisition rights may exercise their rights to acquire a certain number of shares within the exercise period as prescribed in the terms of their stock acquisition rights. Upon exercise of stock acquisition rights, Sony Corporation will be obliged to issue the relevant number of new shares or alternatively to transfer the necessary number of treasury stock held by it. In cases where a particular issue of new shares or stock acquisition rights (i) violates laws and regulations or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation, or (ii) will be performed in a manner materially unfair, and shareholders may suffer disadvantages therefrom, such shareholders may file an injunction to enjoin such issue with a court. 101 Table of Contents (Liquidation rights) In the event of a liquidation of Sony Corporation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts, liquidation expenses and taxes will be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock in proportion to the respective numbers of shares of Common Stock held. (Record date) As mentioned above, March 31 is the record date for Sony Corporations year-end dividends, if declared. So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, the shareholders and beneficial shareholders who are registered as the holders of one or more unit of stock in Sony Corporations register of shareholders and/or beneficial shareholders at the end of each March 31 are also entitled to exercise shareholders rights at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders with respect to the business year ending on such March 31. September 30 is the record date for interim dividends. In addition, Sony Corporation may set a record date for determining the shareholders and/or beneficial shareholders entitled to other rights and for other purposes by giving at least two weeks prior public notice. (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its capital stock) Under the Company Law and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may acquire shares of Common Stock (i) from a specific shareholder other than any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to a special resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders), (ii) from any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to a determination by the CEO), or (iii) by way of purchase on any Japanese stock exchange on which Sony Corporations shares of Common stock are listed or by way of tender offer (as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice) in either case pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or, as the case may be, an ordinary resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders. In the case of (i) above, any other shareholder may make a request to Sony Corporation that such other shareholder be included as a seller in the proposed purchase, provided that no such right will be available if the purchase price or any other consideration to be received by the relevant specific shareholder will not exceed the last trading price of the shares on the relevant stock exchange on the day immediately preceding the date on which the resolution mentioned in (i) above was adopted (or, if there is no trading in the shares on the stock exchange or if the stock exchange is not open on such day, the price at which the shares are first traded on such stock exchange thereafter). The total amount of the purchase price of shares of Common Stock may not exceed the Distributable Amount, as described in (Distribution of Surplus)  Distributions of Surplus  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Shares acquired by Sony Corporation may be held for any period or may be retired at the determination of the CEO. Sony Corporation may also transfer (by public or private sale or otherwise) to any person the shares held by it, subject to a determination by the CEO, and subject also to other requirements similar to those applicable to the issuance of new shares, as described in (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) above. Sony Corporation may also utilize its treasury stock for the purpose of transfer to any person upon exercise of stock acquisition rights or for the purpose of acquiring another company by way of merger, share exchange or corporate split through exchange of treasury stock for shares or assets of the acquired company. (Unit share system) The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that 100 shares constitute one unit of shares of stock. The Board of Directors or the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors is permitted to amend the Articles of Incorporation to reduce the number of shares that constitute a unit or to abolish the unit share system entirely. The number of shares constituting one unit cannot exceed 1,000 shares. Under the unit share system, shareholders have one voting right for each unit of stock that they hold. Any number of shares less than one full unit have neither voting rights nor rights related to voting rights. The Articles of 102 Table of Contents Incorporation and Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation provide that no share certificates shall be issued with respect to any number of shares constituting less than one full unit, unless Sony Corporation deems the issue of such share certificates to be necessary for any shareholder(s). As the transfer of shares normally requires delivery of the certificates, fractions of a unit for which no share certificate has been issued are not transferable. Moreover, holders of shares constituting less than one unit will have no other shareholder rights if Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation so provide, except that such holders may not be deprived of certain rights specified in the Company Law or an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice, including the right to receive distribution of Surplus. A holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may require Sony Corporation to purchase such Shares at their market value in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that a holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may request Sony Corporation to sell to such holder such amount of shares which will, when added together with the shares constituting less than one full unit, constitute one full unit of stock. Such request by a holder and the sale by Sony Corporation must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. A holder who owns American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) evidencing less than 100 ADSs will indirectly own less than one full unit. Although, as discussed above, under the unit share system holders of less than one full unit have the right to require Sony Corporation to purchase their shares or sell shares held by Sony Corporation to such holders, holders of ADRs evidencing ADSs that represent other than integral multiples of whole units are unable to withdraw the underlying shares of capital stock representing less than one full unit and, therefore, are unable, as a practical matter, to exercise the rights to require Sony Corporation to purchase such underlying shares or sell shares held by Sony Corporation to such holders. As a result, access to the Japanese markets by holders of ADRs through the withdrawal mechanism will not be available for dispositions of shares in lots less than one full unit. The unit share system does not affect the transferability of ADSs, which may be transferred in lots of any size. (Sale by Sony Corporation of shares held by shareholders whose location is unknown) Sony Corporation is not required to send a notice to a shareholder if a notice to such shareholder fails to arrive at the registered address of the shareholder in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation continuously for five years or more. In addition, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of shares of capital stock for which the location of the shareholder is unknown. Generally, if (i) notices to a shareholder fail to arrive continuously for five years or more at the shareholders registered address in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, and (ii) the shareholder fails to receive distributions of Surplus on the shares continuously for five years or more at the address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholders shares at the then market price of the shares by a determination of a Corporate Executive Officer and after giving at least three months prior public and individual notice, and hold or deposit the proceeds of such sale or disposal of shares for such shareholder. Reporting of substantial shareholdings The Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan and its related regulations require any person, regardless of residence, who has become, beneficially and solely or jointly, a holder of more than five percent of the total issued shares of capital stock of a company listed on any Japanese stock exchange or whose shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in Japan to file with the Director General of the competent Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance within five business days a report concerning such shareholdings. A similar report must also be filed in respect of any subsequent change of one percent or more in any such holding, with certain exceptions. For this purpose, shares issuable to such persons upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of share subscription warrants or stock acquisition rights are taken into account in determining both the number of shares held by such holders and the issuers total issued share capital. Any such report shall be filed with the Director General of the relevant Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance through the Electronic Disclosure for Investors Network (EDINET) system. Copies of such report must also be furnished to the issuer of such shares. 103 Table of Contents Except for the general limitation under Japanese anti-trust and anti-monopoly regulations against holding of shares of capital stock of a Japanese corporation which leads or may lead to a restraint of trade or monopoly, and except for general limitations under the Company Law or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation on the rights of shareholders applicable regardless of residence or nationality, there is no limitation under Japanese laws and regulations applicable to Sony Corporation or under its Articles of Incorporation on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. There is no provision in Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation or by-laws that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Sony Corporation and that would operate only with respect to merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving Sony Corporation. Material Contracts None Exchange Controls The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law of Japan and its related cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances (the Foreign Exchange Regulations) govern the acquisition and holding of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation by exchange non-residents and by foreign investors. The Foreign Exchange Regulations currently in effect do not, however, affect transactions between exchange non-residents to purchase or sell shares outside Japan using currencies other than Japanese yen. Exchange non-residents are:  individuals who do not reside in Japan; and  corporations whose principal offices are located outside Japan. Generally, branches and other offices of non-resident corporations that are located within Japan are regarded as residents of Japan. Conversely, branches and other offices of Japanese corporations located outside Japan are regarded as exchange non-residents. Foreign investors are:  individuals who are exchange non-residents;  corporations that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or whose principal offices are located outside of Japan; and  corporations (1) of which 50 percent or more of their shares are held, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are exchange non-residents and/or corporations (a) that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or (b) whose principal offices are located outside of Japan or (2) a majority of whose officers, or officers having the power of representation, are individuals who are exchange non-residents. In general, the acquisition of shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) by an exchange non-resident from a resident of Japan is not subject to any prior filing requirements. In certain limited circumstances, however, the Minister of Finance may require prior approval of an acquisition of this type. While prior approval, as described above, is not required, in the case where a resident of Japan transfers shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) for consideration exceeding 100 million yen to an exchange non-resident, the resident of Japan who transfers the shares is required to report the transfer to the Minister of Finance within 20 days from the date of the transfer, unless the transfer was made through a bank, securities company or financial futures trader licensed under Japanese law. If a foreign investor acquires shares of a Japanese company that is listed on a Japanese stock exchange (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) or that is traded on an over-the-counter market in Japan and, as a result of the acquisition, the foreign investor, in combination with any existing holdings, directly or indirectly holds 10 percent or more of the issued shares of the relevant company, the foreign investor must file a report of the acquisition with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers having jurisdiction over that Japanese 104 Table of Contents company within 15 days from and including the date of the acquisition. In limited circumstances, such as where the foreign investor is in a country that is not listed on an exemption schedule in the Foreign Exchange Regulations, or where that Japanese company is engaged in certain businesses designated by the Foreign Exchange Regulations, a prior notification of the acquisition must be filed with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers, who may then modify or prohibit the proposed acquisition. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, dividends paid on and the proceeds from sales in Japan of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation held by non-residents of Japan may generally be converted into any foreign currency and repatriated abroad. Taxation The following is a summary of the major Japanese national tax and U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership, acquisition and disposition of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation and of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation by a non-resident of Japan or a non-Japanese corporation without a permanent establishment in Japan. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to any particular investor, and does not take into account any specific individual circumstances of any particular investor. Accordingly, holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the considerations discussed below to their particular circumstances. This summary is based upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement in relation to the ADSs dated as of June 1, 1961, as amended and restated as of October 31, 1991, as further amended and restated as of March 17, 1995, and in any related agreement, will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of the income tax convention between Japan and the United States (the Treaty) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. holders of ADSs generally will be treated as owning shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation underlying the ADSs evidenced by the ADRs. For the purposes of the following discussion, a U.S. holder is a holder that: (i) is a resident of the U.S. for purposes of the Treaty; (ii) does not maintain a permanent establishment in Japan (a) with which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are effectively connected and through which the U.S. holder carries on or has carried on business or (b) of which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation form part of the business property; and (iii) is eligible for benefits under the Treaty with respect to income and gain derived in connection with shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation. Japanese Taxation The following is a summary of the principal Japanese tax consequences (limited to national taxes) to non-residents of Japan or non-Japanese corporations without a permanent establishment in Japan (non-resident Holders) who are holders of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation or of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation. Generally, non-resident Holders are subject to Japanese withholding tax on dividends paid by Japanese corporations. Sony Corporation withholds taxes from dividends it pays as required by Japanese law. Stock splits are, in general, not a taxable event. In the absence of an applicable tax treaty, convention or agreement reducing the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax or allowing exemption from Japanese withholding tax, the rate of Japanese withholding tax applicable to dividends paid by Japanese corporations to non-resident Holders is generally 20 percent, provided, with respect to dividends paid on listed shares issued by a Japanese corporation (such as the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation) to non-resident Holders other than any individual shareholder who holds 5 percent or more of the total shares issued by the relevant Japanese corporation, the aforementioned 20 percent withholding tax 105 Table of Contents rate is reduced to (i) 7 percent for dividends due and payable on or before March 31, 2009, and (ii) 15 percent for dividends due and payable on or after April 1, 2009. As of the date of this document, Japan has income tax treaties, conventions or agreements whereby the above-mentioned withholding tax rate is reduced, in most cases to 15 percent or 10 percent for portfolio investors (15 percent under the income tax treaties with, among other countries, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and 10 percent under the income tax treaties with France, the U.K. and the United States). Under the Treaty, the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax that may be imposed on dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that does not own directly or indirectly at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the Japanese corporation is generally reduced to 10 percent of the gross amount actually distributed, and Japanese withholding tax with respect to dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that is a pension fund is exempt from Japanese taxation by way of withholding or otherwise unless such dividends are derived from the carrying on of a business, directly or indirectly, by such pension fund. If the maximum tax rate provided for in the income tax treaty applicable to dividends paid by Sony Corporation to any particular non-resident Holder is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law or any particular non-resident Holder is exempt from Japanese income tax with respect to such dividends under the income tax treaty applicable to such particular non-resident Holder, such non-resident Holder is required to submit an Application Form for Income Tax Convention Regarding Relief from Japanese Income Tax on Dividends (together with any other required forms and documents) in advance through Sony Corporation to the relevant tax authority before the payment of dividends. A standing proxy for non-resident Holders of a Japanese corporation may provide this application service. With respect to ADSs, this reduced rate or exemption is applicable if the Depositary or its agent submits two Application Forms (one before payment of dividends and the other within eight months after Sony Corporations fiscal year-end or semi-fiscal year-end). To claim this reduced rate or exemption, a non-resident Holder of ADSs will be required to file a proof of taxpayer status, residence and beneficial ownership (as applicable) and to provide other information or documents as may be required by the Depositary. A non-resident Holder who is entitled, under an applicable income tax treaty, to a reduced rate which is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law or an exemption from the withholding tax, but failed to submit the required application in advance will be entitled to claim the refund of taxes withheld in excess of the rate under an applicable tax treaty (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to a reduced treaty rate under the applicable income tax treaty) or the full amount of tax withheld (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to an exemption under the applicable income tax treaty) from the relevant Japanese tax authority. Sony Corporation does not assume any responsibility to ensure withholding at the reduced treaty rate or to ensure not withholding for shareholders who would be so eligible under any applicable income tax treaty but do not follow the required procedures as stated above. Gains derived from the sale of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation outside Japan by a non-resident Holder holding such shares or ADSs as portfolio investors are, in general, not subject to Japanese income tax or corporation tax. U.S. holders are not subject to Japanese income or corporation tax with respect to such gains under the Treaty. Japanese inheritance and gift taxes at progressive rates may be payable by an individual who has acquired shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation as a legatee, heir or donee even though neither the individual nor the deceased nor donor is a Japanese resident. Holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of these taxes and, in the case of U.S. holders, the possible application of the Estate and Gift Tax Treaty between the U.S. and Japan. United States Taxation with respect to shares of Common Stock and ADSs The U.S. dollar amount of dividends received (prior to deduction of Japanese taxes) by a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock will be able to be included in income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of Sony Corporation as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar 106 Table of Contents amount of dividends received by an individual prior to January 1, 2011 with respect to the ADSs or Common Stock will be subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent if the dividends are qualified dividends. Dividends paid on the Common Stock or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if Sony Corporation was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). Based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2007 taxable year. In addition, based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and Sony Corporations current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the 2008 taxable year. The U.S. Treasury has announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or Common Stock and intermediaries through whom such securities are held will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to treat dividends as qualified for tax reporting purposes. Because such procedures have not yet been issued, it is not clear whether Sony Corporation will be able to comply with them. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of the considerations discussed above and their own particular circumstances. Subject to applicable limitations and special considerations discussed below, a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation will be entitled to a credit for Japanese tax withheld in accordance with the Tax Convention from dividends paid by Sony Corporation. For purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, dividends will be foreign source income, and will constitute passive income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term of hedged positions and may not be allowed in respect of arrangements in which economic profit, after non-U.S. taxes, is insubstantial. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of these rules in light of their particular circumstances. Dividends paid by Sony Corporation to U.S. corporate holders of ADSs or Common Stock will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In general, a U.S. holder will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Common Stock equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or disposition and the U.S. holders tax basis in the ADSs or Common Stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the ADSs or Common Stock have been held for more than one year on the date of the sale or disposition. The net amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder after May 5, 2003 and before January 1, 2011 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent. The net long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder before May 6, 2003 or after December 31, 2010 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20 percent.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Sonys normal course of business is continuously exposed to market fluctuation, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates or stock prices. Sony utilizes several derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements in order to hedge the potential downside risk on the cash flow from the normal course of business caused by market fluctuation. Sony uses foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts primarily to reduce the foreign exchange volatility risk that accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in yen, U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies have through the normal course of Sonys worldwide business. Interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements are utilized to diversify funding conditions or to reduce funding costs, and in the Financial Services segment, these transactions are used for asset liability management. Sony uses these derivative financial instruments mainly for risk-hedging purposes as described above, and few derivative transactions, such as bond futures and bond options are held or utilized for trading purposes in the Financial Services segment. If hedge accounting cannot be applied because the accounts receivable or accounts payable to be hedged are not yet booked, or because cash flows from derivative transactions do not coincide with the underlying exposures recorded on Sonys balance sheet, then Sony understands that such derivatives agreements should be subject to a mark-to-market evaluation and their unrealized gains or losses are recognized in earnings. In addition, Sony holds marketable securities such as straight bonds, convertible bonds, and stocks in yen or other currencies in the Financial Services segment in order to obtain interest income or capital gain on the financial assets under management. Sony understands that its investments in marketable securities are also subjected to market fluctuation. Sony measures the economic impact of market fluctuations on the value of derivatives agreements and marketable securities by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis in order to comply with Item 11 disclosure requirements. VaR in this context indicates the potential maximum amount of loss in fair value resulting from adverse market fluctuations for a selected period of time and at a selected level of confidence. The following table shows the results of VaR. These analyses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 indicate the potential maximum loss in fair value as predicted by the VaR analysis resulting from market fluctuations in one day at a 95 percent confidence level. The VaR of currency exchange rate risk principally consists of risks arising from the volatility of the exchange rates between the yen and U.S. dollar and between the yen and the euro, the currencies in which a significant amount of financial assets and liabilities and derivative transactions are maintained on a consolidated basis. The VaR of interest rate risk and stock price risk consists of risks arising from the volatility of the interest rates and stock prices against invested securities and derivatives transactions in the Financial Services segment. The net VaR for Sonys entire portfolio is smaller than the simple aggregate of VaR for each component of market risk. This is due to the fact that market risk factors such as currency exchange rates, interest rates, and stock prices are not completely independent, and potential profits and losses arising from each market risk may to some degree be mutually offsetting. The disclosed VaR amounts simply represent the calculated potential maximum loss on the specified date and does not necessarily indicate an estimate of actual or future loss.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures Sony has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Sonys management, including the Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Sonys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of March 31, 2008. Disclosure controls and procedures require that information to be disclosed in the reports Sony files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Sonys management, including the Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon Sonys evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2008, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Item 15(b). Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Sonys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sonys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with applicable generally 109 Table of Contents accepted accounting principles. Sonys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Sony; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Sony are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Sonys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Sonys management evaluated the effectiveness of Sonys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2008 based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the evaluation, management has concluded that Sony maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2008. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2008, presented on page F-2. Item 15(c). Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Refer to the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page F-2. Item 15(d). Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in Sonys internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sonys internal control over financial reporting. Item 16. [Reserved] Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Sonys Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Mr. Fueo Sumita each qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in this Item 16A. In addition, both are determined to be independent as defined under the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Standards. Item 16B. Code of Ethics Sony has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 16B of Form 20-F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The code of ethics applies to Sonys Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, chief accounting officer and persons performing similar functions, as well as to directors and all other officers and employees of Sony, as defined in the code of ethics. The code of ethics is available at http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/Environment/management/compliance/qfhh7c000006e52h-att/code_of_conduct.pdf 110 Table of Contents Item 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services Audit and Non-Audit Fees The following table presents fees for audit and other services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2008.

(2) Audit-related Fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services, and mainly include the audits of employee benefit plans. (3) Tax Fees primarily include tax compliance, tax advice and expatriate tax services. (4) All Other Fees comprise fees for all other services not included in any of the other categories noted above. Audit Committees Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures Consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding auditor independence, Sonys Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, reviewing and setting compensation, retaining, and overseeing the work of Sonys independent auditor, so that the auditors independence will not be impaired, including overseeing any separate firm that audits the financial statements of any subsidiary if Sonys independent auditor expressly relies on the audit report of such firm. The Audit Committee has established a formal policy requiring pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor to Sony or any of its subsidiaries. The Audit Committee shall periodically review this policy with due regard for compliance with laws and regulations of host countries where Sony is listed. Prior to the engagement of the independent auditor for the following fiscal years audit, management shall submit an application form to the Audit Committee for comprehensive pre-approval of all recurring services expected to be rendered during that year. In order to obtain comprehensive pre-approval, management shall provide sufficient information regarding each service so that each service can be classified into one of four categories (Audit, Audit-related, Tax, or All Other) as well as information regarding the fees expected to be budgeted for each service. Management shall describe each service in detail and indicate precisely and unambiguously the nature and scope of each particular service. Any additional services not contemplated in the application form shall require the Audit Committees separate pre-approval on an individual basis. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees, resulting from changes in the scope of services to be provided or from other circumstances. The Audit Committee Chair retains pre-approval authority and evaluates items for approval on a request basis. The Audit Committee or its designee shall establish procedures to assure that the independent auditor is aware in a timely manner of the services that have been pre-approved. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the Audit Committee has continued to include individual tax services, recruiting services and corporate tax service to the list of prohibited services stipulated by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and related regulations to enhance auditor independence. The Audit Committee has carefully checked these services and only permitted exceptional instances where the services had already been pre-approved prior to the effective date and instances in which difficulties were encountered in finding an alternative service provider immediately, or when a brief transitional period has been needed. 111 Table of Contents Item 16D.
