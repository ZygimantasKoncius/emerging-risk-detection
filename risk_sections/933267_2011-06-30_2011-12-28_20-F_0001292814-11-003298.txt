D. Risk Factors You should consider the following risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. In general, you take more risk when you invest in the securities of issuers in emerging markets such as Argentina than when you invest in the securities of issuers in the United States. You should understand that an investment in our common shares, GDSs/ADRs and warrants involves a high degree of risk, including the possibility of loss of your entire investment. Risks Related to Argentina Argentina’s growth may not be sustainable. The Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in recent decades, characterized by periods of low or negative growth, high inflation and currency devaluation. During 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced a period of severe political, economic and social crisis, which caused a significant economic contraction and led to radical changes in government policies. Although the economy has recovered significantly since then, uncertainty remains as to whether the recent growth is sustainable, since it has depended, to a significant extent, on favorable exchange rates, high commodity prices and excess capacity. The recovery, however, has resulted in inflation and has intensified the country’s need for capital investment, with many sectors, in particular the energy sector, operating near full capacity. Additionally, the global financial crisis and economic downturn has had a significant adverse impact on the country’s performance and could remain a factor in the foreseeable future. 9 Table of Contents In 2010, the Argentine GDP tended to return to its pre-crisis levels, increasing by 9.2%, according to data published by the National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos or INDEC). For the six months ended June 30, 2011, GDP increased 9.91% relative to the same period the prior year, according to data published by INDEC. As of June 30, 2011, the Monthly Economic Activity Estimator (Estimador Mensual de Actividad Económica or “EMAE”) increased 8.2%, relative to the same period the prior year, according to data published by INDEC. Moreover, the country’s relative stability since 2002 has been affected by increased political tension and government intervention in the economy. Our business depends to a significant extent on macroeconomic and political conditions in Argentina. We cannot assure you that Argentina’s recent growth will continue. Deterioration of the country’s economy would likely have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Continuing inflation may have an adverse effect on the economy. The devaluation of the Peso in January 2002 created pressures on the domestic price system that generated high inflation throughout 2002, before inflation substantially stabilized in 2003. However, inflationary pressures have since reemerged, with consumer prices increasing by 12.3% in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, inflation according to INDEC was 7.7%, 7.2%, 8.5%, 11.0% and 9.7%, respectively, in part due to actions implemented by the Argentine government to control inflation, including limitations on exports and price arrangements agreed upon with private companies. The uncertainty surrounding future inflation may impact the country’s growth. In the past, inflation has undermined the Argentine economy and the government’s ability to create conditions conducive to growth. A return to a high inflation environment would adversely affect the availability of long-term credit and the real estate market and may also affect Argentina’s foreign competitiveness by diluting the effects of the Peso devaluation and adversely impacting the level of economic activity and employment. If inflation remains high or continues to rise, Argentina’s economy may be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. There are concerns about the accuracy of Argentina’s official inflation statistics. In January 2007, the INDEC modified its methodology used to calculate the consumer price index, which is calculated as the monthly average of a weighted basket of consumer goods and services that reflects the pattern of consumption of Argentine households. Several economists, as well as the international and Argentine press, have suggested that this change in methodology was related to the Argentine government’s policy aimed at curbing the increase of inflation and reducing payments on inflation-linked bonds outstanding. At the time that INDEC adopted this change in methodology, the Argentine government also replaced several key officers at INDEC, prompting complaints of governmental interference from the technical staff at INDEC. In addition, the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, has requested that the government clarify its inflation rates. In June 2008, INDEC published a new consumer price index that eliminated nearly half of the items included in previous surveys and introduced adjustable weightings for fruit, vegetables and clothing, which have seasonal cost variations. INDEC has indicated that it based its evaluation of spending habits on a national household consumption survey from 2004 to 2005 in addition to other sources the new index, however, has been criticized by economists and investors after an initial report found prices rising well below expectations. These events have adversely affected the credibility of the consumer price index published by INDEC, as well as other indexes published by INDEC which require the consumer price index for their own calculation, including the poverty index, the unemployment index and real gross domestic product. In December 2010, the Argentine government agreed to meet with an official IMF team that had arrived in Argentina to assist INDEC develop a new national price index. In April 2011, the IMF team completed the second technical mission to assist on the design and methodology of a new national price index. Argentina’s ability to obtain financing from international markets is limited, which may impair its ability to implement reforms and foster economic growth In 2001, the Argentine government defaulted on its sovereign debt which totaled more than US$144 billion. In 2005, the Argentine government launched a debt restructuring exchange offer that achieved an acceptance rate of approximately 76%. Approximately US$20 billion of the then outstanding debt rejected the exchange offer. More recently, through Executive Branch Decree No. 563/10, the Argentine government launched a second debt exchange offer to restructure the outstanding debt that had been rejected in the first exchange offer in 2005. This second exchange offer concluded with an acceptance level of approximately 70%, bringing the total acceptance level of the two exchange offers to approximately 90%. However, approximately, US$4.5 billion of outstanding Argentine sovereign debt remains in default, and the government of Argentina still has to negotiate with the Paris Club to restructure such debt. The fact that Argentina continues to have outstanding sovereign debt in default has limited Argentina’s access to the international markets which, in the future, could directly affect our own ability to access the capital markets to finance our growth and operations, thereby adversely affecting our results from operations and business activities. Argentina is subject to lawsuits filed by bondholders and foreign shareholders in Argentine companies that could limit the government’s use of resources and adversely affect its ability to implement reforms and promote Argentina’s economic growth. Certain holders of un-restructured Argentine sovereign debt in the United States, Italy and Germany have filed legal actions against Argentina, including claims in the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) and other international courts, alleging that certain measures adopted by the Argentine government during the financial crises in 2001 and 2002 violated the equal and just treatment norms stipulated in various bilateral treaties signed by Argentina. As of today, the ICSID has ruled against the Argentine government in various of these legal claims. Numerous legal claims by creditors against the Argentine government are currently pending, and other creditors may decide to file additional claims against Argentina in the future. Litigation initiated by holdout creditors as well as ICSID claims has resulted in material judgments against Argentina and may result in new material judgments ordering the attachment of or injunctions relating to, government assets that may have been intended for other uses. As a result, the Argentine government may not have the financial resources necessary to implement reforms and promote economic growth which could have a material adverse effect on the country’s economy, and consequently, our financial condition and results of operations. 10 Table of Contents Significant devaluation of the Peso against the U.S. Dollar may adversely affect the Argentine economy as well as our financial performance. Despite the positive effects of the real depreciation of the Peso in 2002 on the competitiveness of certain sectors of the Argentine economy, it has also had a far-reaching negative consequences on the Argentine economy and on businesses and individuals’ financial condition. The devaluation of the Peso had a negative impact on the ability of Argentine businesses to pay their foreign currency-denominated debt, which initially led to very high inflation, significantly reduced real wages, a negative impact on businesses whose success depended on domestic market demand such as utilities and the financial industry, and adversely affected the government’s ability to pay its foreign debt obligations. If the Peso devalues significantly, all of the negative effects on the Argentine economy related to such devaluation could recur, and could cause adverse consequences to our business. Moreover, it would likely result in a decline in the value of our common shares and the ADSs as measured in U.S. Dollars. Significant appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. Dollar may adversely affect the Argentine economy. A substantial increase in the value of the Peso against the U.S. Dollar also presents risks for the Argentine economy. The appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. Dollar negatively impacts the financial condition of entities which foreign currency-denominated assets exceed their foreign currency-denominated liabilities, such as us. In addition, in the short term, a significant real appreciation of the Peso would adversely affect exports. This could have a negative effect on GDP growth and employment as well as reduce the Argentine public sector’s revenues by reducing tax collection in real terms, given its heavy reliance on export taxes. A substantial appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. Dollar could have an adverse effect on the Argentine economy and our business. Government measures to preempt or respond to social unrest may adversely affect the Argentine economy and our business. The Argentine government has historically exercised significant influence over the country’s economy. Additionally, the country’s legal and regulatory frameworks have at times suffered radical changes, due to political influence and significant political uncertainties. Moreover, during its crisis in 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced significant social and political turmoil, including civil unrest, riots, looting, nationwide protests, strikes and street demonstrations. Despite Argentina’s economic recovery and relative stabilization, social and political tension and high levels of poverty and unemployment continue. In 2008, Argentina faced nationwide strikes and protests from farmers due to increased export taxes on agricultural products, which disrupted economic activity and heightened political tension. Future government policies to preempt, or in response to, social unrest may include expropriation, nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, suspension of the enforcement of creditors’ rights, new taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and changes in laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment. Such policies could destabilize the country and adversely and materially affect the economy, and thereby our business. The nationalization of Argentina’s pension funds has materially and adversely affected local capital markets and may continue to do so. Under Law No. 26,425, which was published in the Official Gazette in December 2008, the Argentine government transferred approximately Ps.94.4 billion (US$29.3 billion) in assets held by the country’s private Administradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones (pension fund management companies, or “AFJPs”) to the social security agency (“ANSES”) managed by the National State. Law No. 26,425 was supplemented, among others, by Decree No. 2103/2008 which describes the composition of the fund (Fondo de Garantia de Sustentabilidad) to be managed by ANSES and the directions for the management thereof; in turn, Decree No. 2104/08 regulates the matters concerning the transfer to the Argentine government of the contributions and all the documentation of the members of the capitalization regime retroactive as of December 1, 2008. AFJPs were the largest participants in the country’s local capital markets, leading the group of institutional investors. With the nationalization of their assets, the dynamics of the local capital markets changed due to a decrease in their number, becoming a concentrated group. In addition, the government became a significant shareholder in many of the country’s publicly-held companies. Pursuant to current regulations, ANSES may exercise the voting rights corresponding to its respective shares, which could eventually result in uncertain consequences. Exchange controls and restrictions on transfers abroad and capital inflow restrictions have limited, and can be expected to continue to limit, the availability of international credit. In 2001 and 2002, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. On June 2005, the government issued decree No. 616/2005, that established additional controls on capital inflow, including the requirement that, subject to limited exemptions, 30% of all funds remitted to Argentina remain deposited in a domestic financial institution for one year without earning any interest. On October 2011, new exchange controls measures that restrict foreign exchange inflows and outflows of capital have been implemented, among them it was established as a requirement for the repatriation of the direct investment of the non-resident (purchase of shares of local companies and real estate), the demonstration of the income of the currency and its settlement in the single free exchange market “Mercado Único y Libre de Cambios”. This measure increases the cost of obtaining foreign funds and limits access to such financing. The Argentine government may, in the future, impose additional controls on the foreign exchange market and on capital flows from and into Argentina, in response to capital flight or depreciation of the Peso, as other reasons. These restrictions may have a negative effect on the economy and on our business if imposed in an economic environment where access to local capital is constrained. Property values in Argentina can significantly be reduced. Property values are influenced by multiple factors that are not in our control. We cannot assure you that property values will continue to increase or that they will not be reduced. Many of the properties we own are located in Argentina. As a result, a reduction in the value of properties in Argentina would materially affect our business. Payment of dividends to non-residents has been limited in the past and may be limited again. Beginning in February 2002, the payment of dividends, irrespective of the amount, outside Argentina require prior authorization from the Central Bank. On January 7, 2003, the Central Bank issued communication “A” 3859 which is still in force and pursuant to which there are no limitations on companies´ ability to purchase foreign currency and transfer it outside Argentina to pay dividends, provided that those dividends arise from net earnings corresponding to approved and audited financial statements. However similar restrictions may be enacted by the Argentine government or the Central Bank again and, if this were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on the value of our common shares and the GDSs. Moreover, in such event, restrictions on the transfers of funds abroad may impede your ability to receive dividend payments as a holder of GDSs. 11 Table of Contents The stability of the Argentine banking system is uncertain. During 2001 and the first half of 2002, a significant amount of deposits were withdrawn from Argentine financial institutions. This massive withdrawal of deposits was largely due to the loss of confidence of depositors in the Argentine government’s ability to repay its debts, including its debts within the financial system, and to maintain Peso- U.S. Dollar parity in the context of its solvency crisis. To prevent a run on the U.S. Dollar reserves of local banks, the government restricted the amount of money that account holders could withdraw from banks and introduced exchange controls restricting capital outflows. While the condition of the financial system has improved, adverse economic developments, even if not related to or attributable to the financial system, could result in deposits flowing out of the banks and into the foreign exchange market, as depositors seek to shield their financial assets from a new crisis. Any run on deposits could create liquidity or even solvency problems for financial institutions, resulting in a contraction of available credit. In the event of a future shock, such as the failure of one or more banks or a crisis in depositor confidence, the Argentine government could impose further exchange controls or transfer restrictions and take other measures that could lead to renewed political and social tensions and undermine the Argentine government’s public finances, which could adversely affect Argentina’s economy and prospects for economic growth which could adversely affect our business. The Argentine economy could be adversely affected by economic developments in other global markets. Financial and securities markets in Argentina are influenced, to varying degrees, by economic and market conditions in other global markets. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors’ perception of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into other countries, including Argentina and the availability of funds for issuers in such countries. Lower capital inflows and declining prices of securities may adversely affect the real economy of a country through higher interest rates or currency volatility. The Argentine economy was adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in the 1990s, including those in Mexico in 1994, the collapse of several Asian economies between 1997 and 1998, the economic crisis in Russia in 1998 and the Brazilian devaluation in January 1999. In addition, Argentina is also affected by the economic conditions of major trade partners, such as Brazil and/or other countries that have influence over world economic cycles, such as the United States. If interest rates rise significantly in developed economies, including the United States, Argentina and other emerging market economies could find it more difficult and expensive to borrow capital and refinance existing debt, which would negatively affect their economic growth. In addition, if these developing countries, which are also Argentina’s trade partners, fall into a recession the Argentine economy would be affected by a decrease in exports. All of these factors would have a negative impact on our business, operations and financial condition. Since 2008, crisis “sub-prime” in the United States and the recent economic recession and fiscal deficit experienced in certain European countries have caused an economic slowdown in the world’s principal economies. Recently, the possibility of a Greek or some Eurozone countries default has increased market volatility and it can complicate financing acces a decline in global economic activity. The global economic crisis and the consequent instability of the international financial system have had and may continue to have a negative effect on Argentina’s economic growth. Moreover, political instability and economic crisis, such as the recent turmoil in Africa and the Middle East, as well as natural disasters, such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the economic and social crisis in Europe and the U.S., may cause instability in the local markets. Argentina may be adversely affected by such events as a result of the lack of international credit, a reduction in demand for Argentine exports, a significant reduction of direct foreign investment and higher inflation rates throughout the world. The occurrence of any or all such events, as well as any event affecting Argentina’s main regional partners (including the Mercosur member countries) may have a significant adverse effect on the Argentine economy and, consequently, on our operations, businesses and results. If prices for Argentina’s main commodity exports decline, such decline could have an adverse effect on Argentina’s economic growth and on our business. Argentina’s economy has historically relied on the export of commodities, the prices of which have been volatile in the past and largely outside its control. Argentina’s recovery from the financial crisis in 2001 and 2002 depended to a significant extent on the rise in commodity prices, particularly prices of its main commodity exports, such as soybeans. High commodity prices have contributed significantly to government revenues from export taxes. If commodity prices continue to decline, the growth of the Argentine economy could be affected. Such occurrence could have a negative impact on the levels of government revenues, the government’s ability to service its debt and on our business. Restrictions on the supply of energy could negatively affect Argentina’s economy. As a result of a prolonged recession, and the forced conversion into Pesos and subsequent freeze of gas and electricity tariffs in Argentina, there has been a lack of investment in gas and electricity supply and transport capacity in Argentina in recent years. At the same time, demand for natural gas and electricity has increased substantially, driven by a recovery in economic conditions and price constraints, which has prompted the government to adopt a series of measures that have resulted in industry shortages and/or costs increase. The federal government has been taking a number of measures to alleviate the short-term impact of energy shortages on residential and industrial users. If these measures prove to be insufficient, or if the investment that is required to increase natural gas production and transportation capacity and energy generation and transportation capacity over the medium-and long-term fails to materialize on a timely basis, economic activity in Argentina could be limited, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. As a first step of these measures, subsidies on energy tariffs are being withdrawn to industries and high income consumers. As a result, our operating costs may increase. 12 Table of Contents Risks Related to our Business Our performance is subject to risks associated with our properties and with the real estate industry. Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of the securities issued by us, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate sufficient revenues to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay our debt obligations will be adversely affected. Events or conditions beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations or the value of our properties include: · downturns in the national, regional and local economic climate; · volatility and decline in discretionary spending; · competition from other shopping centers; · local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, or other commercial or industrial space; · decreases in consumption levels; · changes in interest rates and availability of financing; · the exercise by our tenants of their legal right to early termination of their leases; · vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; · increased operating costs, including insurance expense, salary increases, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs; · civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; · significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property; · declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; · changes in our ability or our tenants’ ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance, possibly decreasing the useful life of and revenue from property; and · changes in law or governmental regulations (such as those governing usage, zoning and real property taxes) or government action such as expropriation or confiscation. If any one or more of the foregoing conditions were to affect our business, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our investment in property development, redevelopment and construction may be less profitable than we anticipate. We are engaged in the development and construction of office space, retail and residential properties, shopping centers and residential apartment complexes, frequently through third-party contractors. Risks associated with our development, re-development and construction activities include the following, among others: · abandonment of development opportunities and renovation proposals; · construction costs of a project may exceed our original estimates for reasons including raises in interest rates or increases in the costs of materials and labor, making a project unprofitable; · occupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; · pre-construction buyers may default on their purchase contracts or units in new buildings may remain unsold upon completion of construction; · the unavailability of favorable financing alternatives in the private and public debt markets; 13 Table of Contents · sale prices for residential units may be insufficient to cover development costs; · construction and lease-up may not be completed on schedule, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs; · impossibility to obtain, delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, or building moratoria and anti-growth legislation; · significant time lags between the commencement and completion of projects subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuation in the general economy; · construction may not be completed on schedule because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, or man-made or natural disasters (such as fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or floods), resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs; · general changes in our tenants’ demand for rental properties outside of the city of Buenos Aires; and · we may incur capital expenditures that could result in considerable time consuming efforts and which may never be completed due to government restrictions. In addition, we may face contractors’ claims for the enforcement of labor laws in Argentina (sections 30, 31, 32 under Law No. 20,744), which provide for joint and several liability. Many companies in Argentina hire personnel from third-party companies that provide outsourced services, and sign indemnity agreements in the event of labor claims from employees of such third company that may affect the liability of such hiring company. However, in recent years several courts have denied the existence of independence in those labor relationships and declared joint and several liabilities for both companies. While our policies with respect to expansion, renovation and development activities are intended to limit some of the risks otherwise associated with such activities, we are nevertheless subject to risks associated with the construction of properties, such as cost overruns, design changes and timing delays arising from a lack of availability of materials and labor, weather conditions and other factors outside of our control, as well as financing costs, may exceed original estimates, possibly making the associated investment unprofitable. Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these redevelopment projects and harm our operating results. The real estate industry in Argentina is increasingly competitive. Our real estate and construction activities are highly concentrated in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, where the real estate market is highly competitive due to a scarcity of properties in sought-after locations and the increasing number of local and international competitors. Furthermore, the Argentine real estate industry is generally highly competitive and fragmented and does not have high barriers to entry restricting new competitors from entering the market. The main competitive factors in the real estate development business include availability and location of land, price, funding, design, quality, reputation and partnerships with developers. A number of residential and commercial developers and real estate services companies compete with us in seeking land for acquisition, financial resources for development and prospective purchasers and tenants. Other companies, including joint ventures of foreign and local companies, have become increasingly active in the real estate business in Argentina, further increasing this competition. To the extent that one or more of our competitors are able to acquire and develop desirable properties, as a result of greater financial resources or otherwise, our business could be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to respond to such pressures as promptly as our competitors, or the level of competition increases, our financial condition and results of our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our shopping centers are located in close proximity to other shopping centers, numerous retail stores and residential properties. The number of comparable properties located in the vicinity of our property could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease retail space in our shopping centers or sell units in our residential complexes and on the rent price or the sale price that we are able to charge. We cannot assure you that other shopping center operators, including international shopping center operators, will not invest in Argentina in the near future. As additional companies become active in the Argentine shopping center market, such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We have in the past acquired, and intend to acquire in the future, properties, including large properties (such as the acquisition of Edificio República, Abasto de Buenos Aires, or Alto Palermo Shopping) that would increase our size and potentially alter our capital structure. Although we believe that the acquisitions that we have completed in the past and that we expect to undertake in the future have, and will, enhance our future financial performance, the success of such transactions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the risk that: · we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms; · acquired properties may fail to perform as expected; · the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates; · acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and 14 Table of Contents · we may not be able to efficiently integrate acquired properties, particularly portfolios of properties, into our organization and to manage new properties in a way that allows us to realize cost savings and synergies. Some of the land we have purchased is not zoned for development purposes, and we may be unable to obtain, or may face delays in obtaining the necessary zoning permits and other authorizations. We own several plots of land which are not zoned for the type of projects we intend to develop. In addition, we do not yet have the required land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in our attempts to rezone land and to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations, or that rezoning efforts and permit requests will not be unreasonably delayed or rejected. Moreover, we may be affected by building moratorium and anti-growth legislation. If we are unable to obtain all of the governmental permits and authorizations we need to develop our present and future projects as planned, we may be forced to make unwanted modifications to such projects or abandon them altogether. Acquired properties may subject us to unknown liabilities. Properties that we acquire may be subject to unknown liabilities for which we would have no recourse, or only limited recourse, to the former owners of such properties. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of an acquired property, we might be required to pay significant sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our financial results and cash flow. Unknown liabilities relating to acquired properties could include: · liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination; · law reforms and governmental regulations (such as those governing usage, zoning and real property taxes); and · liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business. Some potential losses are not covered by insurance, and certain kinds of insurance coverage may become prohibitively expensive. We currently carry insurance policies that cover potential risks such as civil liability, fire, loss of profit, floods, including extended coverage and losses from leases on all of our properties. Although we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are generally customary, there are certain types of losses, such as lease and other contract claims, terrorism and acts of war that generally are not insured. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. If any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Moreover, we do not purchase life or disability insurance for any of our key employees. If any of our key employees were to die or become incapacitated, we would experience losses caused by a disruption in our operations which will not be covered by insurance, and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices. Insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold, or, if offered, these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. Our dependence on rental income may adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations. A substantial part of our income is derived from rental income from real property. As a result, our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. Our income and funds for distribution would be negatively affected if a significant number of our tenants, or any of our major tenants (as discussed in more detail below): · delay lease commencements; · decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration; · fail to make rental payments when due; or · close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenant’s leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. In addition, we cannot assure you that any tenant whose lease expires will renew that lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically advantageous terms. The loss of rental revenues from a number of our tenants and our inability to replace such tenants may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to meet debt and other financial obligations. Demand for our premium properties which target the high-income demographic may be insufficient. We have focused on development projects intended to cater to affluent individuals and have entered into property swap agreements pursuant to which we contribute our undeveloped properties to ventures with developers who will deliver to us units in premium locations. At the time the developers return these properties to us, demand for premium residential units could be significantly lower. In such case, we would be unable to sell these residential units at the prices or in the time frame we estimated, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 15 Table of Contents It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly and transfer restrictions apply to some of our properties. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and this tends to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, significant expenditures associated with each equity investment, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in income from a certain investment. If income from a property declines while the related expenses do not decline, our business would be adversely affected. Some of our properties are mortgaged to secure payment of our indebtedness, and if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, we could lose money as a result of foreclosure on such mortgages and even lose such property. In addition, if it becomes necessary or desirable for us to dispose of one or more of the mortgaged properties, we might not be able to obtain a release of the lien on the mortgaged property without payment of the associated debt. The foreclosure of a mortgage on a property or inability to sell a property could adversely affect our business. In transactions of this kind, we may also agree, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell the acquired properties for significant periods of time. An adverse economic environment for real estate companies and the credit crisis may adversely impact our results of operations and business prospects significantly. The success of our business and profitability of our operations are dependent on continued investment in the real estate markets and access to capital and debt financing. A long term crisis of confidence in real estate investments and lack of available credit for acquisitions would be likely to constrain our business growth. As part of our business goals, we intend to increase our properties portfolio with strategic acquisitions of core properties at advantageous prices, and core plus and value added properties where we believe we can bring necessary expertise to enhance property values. In order to pursue acquisitions, we may need access to equity capital and/or debt financing. Recent disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy and restructuring of major financial institutions, may adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt and the availability and cost of credit in the near future. Any consideration of sales of existing properties or portfolio interests may be tempered by decreasing property values. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness depends on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions. If a recurrence of the disruptions in financial markets presents itself in the future, there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore investor confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit. Our level of debt may adversely affect our operations and our ability to pay our debt as it becomes due. We had, and expect to continue to have, substantial liquidity and capital resource requirements to finance our business. As of June 30, 2011, our consolidated financial debt was Ps.2,441 million (including short-term and long-term debt, accrued interest and deferred financing costs). Although we are generating sufficient funds from operating cash flows to satisfy our debt service requirements and our capacity to obtain new financing is adequate given the current availability of credit lines with the banks, we cannot assure you that we will maintain such cash flow and adequate financial capacity in the future. The fact that we are leveraged may affect our ability to refinance existing debt or borrow additional funds to finance working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, the recent disruptions in the global financial markets, including the bankruptcy and restructuring of major financial institutions, may adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt and the availability and cost of credit in the future. In such conditions, access to equity and debt financing options may be restricted and it may be uncertain how long these circumstances may last. This would require us to allocate a substantial portion of cash flow to repay principal and interest, thereby reducing the amount of money available to invest in operations, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our leverage could also affect our competitiveness and limit our ability to react to changes in market conditions, changes in the real estate industry and economic downturns. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt service requirements or to obtain future financing. If we cannot satisfy our debt service requirements or if we default on any financial or other covenants in our debt arrangements, the lenders and/or holders of our debt will be able to accelerate the maturity of such debt or cause defaults under the other debt arrangements. Our ability to service debt obligations or to refinance them will depend upon our future financial and operating performance, which will, in part, be subject to factors beyond our control such as macroeconomic conditions (including the recent international credit crisis) and regulatory changes in Argentina. If we cannot obtain future financing, we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our planned capital expenditures, which could adversely affect our ability to generate cash flows and repay our obligations. We may be negatively affected by a financial crisis in the U.S., the European Union and global capital markets. We must maintain liquidity to fund our working capital, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption during the last credit crisis. If our current resources do not satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of the prospects of our company or the industry generally. We may not be able to successfully obtain any necessary additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The recurrence of a credit crisis could have a negative impact on our major customers, which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The recent credit crisis had a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. The impact of a crisis on our major tenants cannot be predicted and may be quite severe. A disruption in the ability of our significant tenants to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of their products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. 16 Table of Contents Adverse incidents that occur in our shopping centers may result in damage to our image and a decrease in the number of our customers. Given that shopping centers are open to the public, with ample circulation of people, accidents, theft, robbery and other incidents may occur in our facilities, regardless of the preventative measures we adopt. In the event such an incident or series of incidents occurs, shopping center customers and visitors may choose to visit other shopping venues that they believe are safer and less violent, which may cause a reduction in the sales volume and operating income of our shopping centers. We are subject to risks inherent to the operation of shopping centers that may affect our profitability. Shopping centers are subject to various factors that affect their development, administration and profitability. These factors include: · the accessibility and the attractiveness of the area where the shopping center is located; · the intrinsic attractiveness of the shopping center; · the flow of people and the level of sales of each shopping center rental unit; · increasing competition from internet sales; · the amount of rent collected from each shopping center rental unit; · changes in consumer demand and availability of consumer credit, both of which are highly sensitive to general macroeconomic conditions; and · the fluctuations in occupancy levels in the shopping centers. An increase in operating costs, caused by inflation or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on us if our tenants are unable to pay higher rent due to the increase in expenses. Moreover, the shopping center business is closely related to consumer spending and to the economy in which customers are located. All of our shopping centers are in Argentina, and, as a consequence, their business could be seriously affected by potential recession in Argentina. For example, during the economic crisis in Argentina, spending decreased significantly, unemployment, political instability and inflation significantly reduced consumer spending in Argentina, lowering tenants’ sales and forcing some tenants to leave our shopping centers. If the international financial crisis has a substantial impact on economic activity in Argentina, it will likely have a material adverse effect on the revenues from the shopping center activity. The loss of significant tenants could adversely affect both the operating revenues and value of our shopping center and other rental properties. If certain of our most important tenants were to experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, insolvency or a general downturn of business, or if we simply failed to retain their patronage, our business could be adversely affected. Our shopping centers and, to a lesser extent, our office buildings are typically anchored by significant tenants, such as well known department stores who generate shopping traffic at the mall. A decision by such significant tenants to cease operations at our shopping centers or office buildings could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of the affected segment and, by extension, on our financial condition and results of operations. The closing of one or more significant tenants may induce other major tenants at an affected property to terminate their leases, to seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the property. In addition, key tenants at one or more properties might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. The bankruptcy and/or closure of one or more significant tenants, if we are not able to successfully re-lease the affected space, could have a material adverse effect on both the operating revenues and underlying value of the properties involved. Our future acquisitions may be unprofitable. We intend to acquire additional shopping center properties to the extent that they will be acquired on advantageous terms and meet our investment criteria. Acquisitions of commercial properties entail general investment risks associated with any real estate investment, including: · our estimates of the cost of improvements needed to bring the property up to established standards for the market may prove to be inaccurate; · properties we acquire may fail to achieve within the time frames we project the occupancy or rental rates we project at the time we make the decision to acquire, which may result in the properties’ failure to achieve the returns we projected; · our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs; and · our investigation of a property or building prior to its acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost. If we acquire a business, we will be required to integrate the operations, personnel and accounting and information systems of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions of or investments in companies may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management’s attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with our current tenants and employees. Our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital. Our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition and development of additional properties. As a result, we are likely to depend to an important degree on the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. Our access to debt or equity capital markets depends on a number of factors, including the market’s perception of our growth potential, our ability to pay dividends, our financial condition, our credit rating and our current and potential future earnings. Depending on the outcome of these factors, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy. 17 Table of Contents Serious illnesses and pandemics, such as the 2009 outbreak of Influenza A H1N1 virus, also known as the “swine flu”, have in the past adversely affected consumer and tourist activity, may do so in the future and may adversely affect our results of operations. As a result of the outbreak of Influenza A H1N1 during the winter of 2009, consumers and tourists dramatically changed their spending and travel habits to avoid contact with crowds. Further, several governments enacted regulations limiting the operation of schools, cinemas and shopping centers. Even though the Argentine government only issued public service recommendations to the population regarding the risks involved in visiting crowded places, such as shopping centers, and did not issue specific regulations limiting access to public places, a significant number of consumers nonetheless changed their habits vis-a-vis shopping centers and malls. Additionally, the outbreak of Influenza A H1N1 contributed significantly to a decrease in the number of tourists visiting Argentina in 2009. Although there was not an outbreak of AH1N1 influenza in the winter of 2010 and 2011, we cannot assure you that a new outbreak or health hazard will not occur in the future, or that such an outbreak or hazard would not significantly negatively affect consumer and/or tourist activity, and that such scenario would not adversely affect our businesses. We are subject to risks inherent to the operation of office buildings that may affect our profitability. Office buildings are subject to various factors that affect their development, administration and profitability. The profitiablity of our office buildings may be affected by: · a decrease in demand for office space; · a deterioration in the financial condition of our tenants, which may result in defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity or for other reasons; · difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space; · decreases in rents as a result of oversupply, particularly of newer buildings; · competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our tenants; and · maintenance, repair and renovation costs incurred to maintain the competitiveness of our office buildings. We are subject to risks affecting the hotel industry. The full-service segment of the lodging industry in which our hotels operate is highly competitive. The operational success of our hotels is highly dependent on our ability to compete in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations, rates, quality food and beverage facilities and other services and amenities. Our hotels may face additional competition if other companies decide to build new hotels or improve their existing hotels to increase their attractiveness. In addition, the profitability of our hotels depends on: · our ability to form successful relationships with international and local operators to run our hotels; · changes in tourism and travel patterns, including seasonal changes and chanes due to pandemic outbreaks, such as the AH1N1 virus or weather phenomenom or other natural events, such as the eruption of the Puyehué volcano in June 2011; · affluence of tourists, which can be affected by a slowdown in global economy; and · taxes and governmental regulations affecting wages, prices, interest rates, construction procedures and costs. An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policies on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties. Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from our negligence or intentional misconduct or that of our agents. Tenants are generally required, at the tenant’s expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. In addition, we cannot assure the holders that the tenants will properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles. 18 Table of Contents Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our business is subject to extensive regulation and additional regulations may be imposed in the future. Our activities are subject to federal, state and municipal laws, and to regulations, authorizations and licenses required with respect to construction, zoning, use of the soil, environmental protection and historical patrimony, consumer protection and other requirements, all of which affect our ability to acquire land, buildings and shopping centers, develop and build projects and negotiate with customers. In addition, companies in this industry are subject to increasing tax rates, the creation of new taxes and changes in the taxation regime. We are required to obtain licenses and authorizations with different governmental authorities in order to carry out our projects. Maintaining our licenses and authorizations can be a costly provision. In the case of non-compliance with such laws, regulations, licenses and authorizations, we may face fines, project shutdowns, and cancellation of licenses and revocation of authorizations. In addition, public authorities may issue new and stricter standards, or enforce or construe existing laws and regulations in a more restrictive manner, which may force us to make expenditures to comply with such new rules. Development activities are also subject to risks relating to potential delays in obtaining or an inability to obtain all necessary zoning, environmental, land-use, development, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. Any such delays or failures to obtain such government approvals may have an adverse effect on our business. In the past, the Argentine government imposed strict and burdensome regulations regarding leases in response to housing shortages, high rates of inflation and difficulties in accessing credit. Such regulations limited or prohibited increases on rental prices and prohibited eviction of tenants, even for failure to pay rent. Most of our leases provide that the tenants pay all costs and taxes related to their respective leased areas. In the event of a significant increase in the amount of such costs and taxes, the Argentine government may respond to political pressure to intervene by regulating this practice, thereby negatively affecting our rental income. We cannot assure you that the Argentine government will not impose similar or other regulations in the future. Changes in existing laws or the enactment of new laws governing the ownership, operation or leasing of properties in Argentina could negatively affect the Argentine real estate market and the rental market and materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. Argentine Lease Law No. 23,091 imposes restrictions that limit our flexibility. Argentine laws governing leases impose certain restrictions, including the following: · lease agreements may not contain inflation adjustment clauses based on consumer price indexes or wholesale price indexes. Although many of our lease agreements contain readjustment clauses, these are not based on an official index nor do they reflect the inflation index. In the event of litigation these provisions may not be enforceable and therefore it may be impossible for us to adjust the amounts owed to us under our lease agreements; · residential leases must comply with a mandatory minimum term of two years and retail leases must comply with a mandatory minimum term of three years except in the case of stands and/or spaces for special exhibitions; · lease terms may not exceed ten years, except for leases regulated by Law No. 25,248 (which provides that leases containing a purchase option are not subject to term limitations); and · tenants may rescind commercial and office lease agreements after the initial six-month period. As a result of the foregoing, we are exposed to the risk of increases of inflation under our leases and the exercise of rescission rights by our tenants could materially and adversely affect our business and we cannot assure you that our tenants will not exercise such right, especially if rent values stabilize or decline in the future or if economic conditions deteriorate. Eviction proceedings in Argentina are difficult and time consuming. Although Argentine law permits a summary proceeding to collect unpaid rent and a special proceeding to evict tenants, eviction proceedings in Argentina are difficult and time-consuming. Historically, the heavy workloads of the courts and the numerous procedural steps required have generally delayed landlords’ efforts to evict tenants. Eviction proceedings generally take between six months and two years from the date of filing of the suit to the time of actual eviction. We have usually attempted to negotiate the termination of lease agreements with defaulting tenants after the first few months of non-payment in order to avoid legal proceedings. Delinquency may increase significantly in the future, and such negotiations with tenants may not be as successful as they have been in the past. Moreover, new Argentine laws and regulations may forbid or restrict eviction proceedings, and in such case, they would likely have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. We are subject to great competitive pressure. All of our properties are located in Argentina. There are other shopping centers and numerous smaller retail stores and residential properties within the market area of each of our properties. The number of competing properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease retail space in our shopping centers or sell units in our residential complexes and on the amount of rent or the sale price that we are able to charge. To date, there have been relatively few companies competing with us for shopping center properties. However, if additional companies become active in the Argentine shopping center market in the future, such competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our assets are concentrated in the Buenos Aires area. Our principal properties are located in the City of Buenos Aires and the Province of Buenos Aires and a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from such properties. For our fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2011, approximately 88% and 85% of our consolidated revenues were derived from properties in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area including the City of Buenos Aires. Although we own properties and may acquire or develop additional properties outside Buenos Aires, we expect to continue to depend to a large extent on economic conditions affecting those areas, and therefore, an economic downturn in those areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents We face risks associated with the expansion to other Latin American markets. From 1994 to 2002, we had substantial investments outside of Argentina, including Brazil Realty, which was sold in 2002, and Fondo de Valores Inmobiliarios in Venezuela, which was sold in 2001. We continue to believe that Brazil, Uruguay and other Latin American countries offer attractive opportunities for growth in the real estate sector. We will continue to consider investment opportunities outside of Argentina as they arise. Investments in Brazil and other Latin American countries are subject to significant risks including sovereign risks and risks affecting these countries’ real estate sectors. These risks include competition by well-established as well as new developers, unavailability of financing or financing on terms that are not acceptable to us, exchange rate fluctuations, lack of liquidity in the market, rising construction costs and inflation, extensive and potentially increasing regulation and bureaucratic procedures for obtaining permits and authorizations, political and economic instability that may result in sharp shifts in demand for properties, risks of default in payment and difficulty evicting defaulting tenants. Recently, we acquired a property in Partido de la Costa, Department of Canelones, Uruguay, near Montevideo, where it plans to develop a real estate housing units and commercial premises. We face risks associated with our expansion in the United States. On July 2, 2008, we acquired a 30% interest in Metropolitan, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, United States of America. During fiscal year 2011, as a result of certain negotiations, an agreement was reached to restructure Metropolitan’s debt, following such closing, we indirectly hold 49% of New Lipstick LLC, a holding company that is owner of Metropolitan. Metropolitan’s main asset is the Lipstick Building, a 34-story building located on Third Avenue between 53rd and 54th streets in Manhattan, New York City. Metropolitan has incurred mortgage debt in connection with the Lipstick Building. For more information about Metropolitan, please see “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” Since August 2009 we acquired and subsequently sold part of our equity interests in Hersha Hospitality Trust, therefore, on June 30, 2011 our share is 9.2%. The main assets are hotels, most of them are located on the east coast of the United States. At June 30, 2011, Hersha was the holder of an indirect controlling interest in 78 hotels. For more information on Hersha, see "Business-International" In December 2010, we, through Rigby 183 LLC, in which we indirectly holds a 49% equity interest through IMadison LLC, jointly with other partners, acquired a building located at 183 Madison Avenue, Midtown South, Manhattan, New York. If the conditions of our Supertel Hospitality Inc. tender offer made in November 2011 are met, we will have an important equity ownership in this REIT, which main assets are 101 hotels across 23 states of the US. For more information about liquidity please see “Recent Developments”. The U.S. markets have recently experienced extreme dislocations and a severe contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the credit markets were frozen. Global financial markets have been disrupted by, among other things, volatility in securities prices, rating downgrades and declining valuations, and this disruption has been acute in real estate and related markets. This disruption has lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment and has precipitated an economic recession around the globe. As a consequence, owners and operators of commercial real estate, including hotels and resorts, and commercial real estate properties such as offices, have experienced dramatic declines in property values and may continue to experience declines in business and real estate values in the U.S. or elsewhere. We are unable to predict the likely duration or severity of the effects of the disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the bankruptcy of Inversora Dársena Norte S.A. is extended to our subsidiary Puerto Retiro, we will likely lose a significant investment in a unique waterfront land reserve in the City of Buenos Aires. On November 18, 1997, in connection with the acquisition of our subsidiary Inversora Bolívar S.A. (“Inversora Bolívar”), we indirectly acquired 35.2% of the capital stock of Puerto Retiro. Inversora Bolívar had purchased such shares of Puerto Retiro from Redona Investments Ltd. N.V. in 1996. In 1999, we, through Inversora Bolívar, increased our interest in Puerto Retiro to 50.0% of its capital stock. On April 18, 2000, Puerto Retiro received notice of a complaint filed by the Argentine government, through the Ministry of Defense, seeking to extend the bankruptcy of Inversora Dársena Norte S.A. (“Indarsa”). Upon filing of the complaint, the bankruptcy court issued an order restraining the ability of Puerto Retiro to dispose of, in any manner, the real property it had purchased in 1993 from Tandanor S.A. (“Tandanor”). Puerto Retiro appealed the restraining order which was confirmed by the court on December 14, 2000. In 1991, Indarsa purchased 90% of Tandanor, a formerly government-owned company, which owned a large piece of land near Puerto Madero of approximately 8 hectares, divided into two spaces: Planta 1 and 2. After the purchase of Tandanor by Indarsa, in June 1993 Tandanor sold “Planta 1” to Puerto Retiro, for a sum of US$18 million pursuant to a valuation performed by J.L. Ramos, a well-known real estate brokerage firm in Argentina. Indarsa failed to pay to the Argentine government the outstanding price for its purchase of the stock of Tandanor. As a result, the Ministry of Defense requested the bankruptcy of Indarsa. Since the only asset of Indarsa was its holding in Tandanor, the Argentine government is seeking to extend Indarsa’s bankruptcy to the companies or individuals which, according to its view, acted as a single economic group. In particular, the Argentine government has requested the extension of the bankruptcy to Puerto Retiro, which acquired Planta 1 from Tandanor. The time for producing evidence in relation to these legal proceeding has expired. The parties have submitted their closing arguments and are awaiting a final judgment. However, the judge has delayed his decision until a final judgment in the criminal proceedings against the former Defense Minister and former directors of Indarsa has been delivered. We cannot give you any assurance that we will prevail in this proceeding, and if the plaintiff’s claim is upheld by the courts, all of the assets of Puerto Retiro would likely be used to pay Indarsa’s debts and our investment in Puerto Retiro, valued at Ps.54.4 million as of June 30, 2011, would be lost. As of June 30, 2011, we had not established any reserve in respect of this contingency. 20 Table of Contents Property ownership through joint ventures or minority participation may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. We develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. For example, in our Shopping Center segment, as of June 30, 2011, we owned approximately 94.9% of Alto Palermo. Through our subsidiary Alto Palermo S.A. (“Alto Palermo” or “APSA”), we own 80% of Panamerican Mall S.A., while another 20% is owned by Centro Comercial Panamericano S.A. In our Development and Sale of Properties segment, we have ownership of 50% in Puerto Retiro. In addition we have a 100% stake in Solares de Santa María S.A. In our Hotel segment, we own 50% of the Llao Llao Hotel, while the other 50% is owned by the Sutton Group. We own 80% of the Hotel Libertador, Hoteles Sheraton de Argentina S.A. owns 20%. We own 76.34% of Hotel Intercontinental. In the Financial Operations and others segment, we own approximately 29.77% of Banco Hipotecario, while the Argentine government has a controlling interest in it. Finally, we own a 49% interest in Metropolitan, 49% in a building located at Madison Avenue in New York and 9.2% in Hersha. We could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, our joint venture partners may, at any time, have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. For example, the approval of certain of the other investors is required with respect to operating budgets and refinancing, encumbering, expanding or selling any of these properties. In some instances, our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. If the objectives of our joint venture partners are inconsistent with our own objectives, we will not be able to act exclusively in our interests. If one or more of the investors in any of our jointly owned properties were to experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, insolvency or a general downturn of business, there could be an adverse effect on the relevant property or properties and in turn, on our financial performance. Should a joint venture partner be declared bankrupt, we could become liable for our partner’s share of joint venture liabilities. Dividend restrictions in our subsidiaries’ debt agreements may adversely affect it. We have subsidiaries and an important source of funds for are cash dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries. The debt agreements of our subsidiaries contain covenants restricting their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions. If our subsidiaries are unable to make payments to us, or are able to pay only limited amounts, we may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness. We are dependent on our chairman Eduardo Elsztain and certain other senior managers. Our success depends on the continued employment of Eduardo S. Elsztain, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who has significant expertise and knowledge of our business and industry. The loss of or interruption in his services for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success also depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel. A failure to hire or retain qualified personnel may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may face potential conflicts of interest relating to our principal shareholders. Our largest beneficial owner is Mr. Eduardo S. Elsztain, through his indirect shareholding through Cresud S.A.C.I.F.y A. (“Cresud”). As of June 30, 2011, such beneficial ownership consisted of: (i) 292,811,013 shares held by Cresud, (ii) 41,080,112 shares held by Agrology, S.A. (“Agrology”), (iii) 628,070 shares held by Consultores Assets Management S.A., and (iv) 765,100 shares held directly by Mr. Elsztain. Conflicts of interest between our management, Cresud S.A.C.I.F. y A. and our affiliates may arise in the performance of our business activities. As of June 30, 2011, Mr. Elsztain also beneficially owned (i) approximately 37.0% of Cresud’s common shares and (ii) approximately 94.9% of the common shares of our subsidiary Alto Palermo. We cannot assure you that our principal shareholders and their affiliates will not limit or cause us to forego business opportunities that our affiliates may pursue or that the pursuit of other opportunities will be in our interest. Due to the currency mismatches between our assets and liabilities, we have significant currency exposure. As of June 30, 2011, the majority of our liabilities, such as our 8.5% and 11.5% notes due 2017 and 2020 respectively, Alto Palermo’s Series I Notes and Alto Palermo’s convertible notes are denominated in U.S. Dollars, while a significant portion of our revenues and assets as of June 30, 2011, are denominated in Pesos. This currency gap exposes us to a risk of exchange rate volatility, which would negatively affect our financial results if the Dollar were to appreciate against the Peso. Any further depreciation of the Peso against the U.S. Dollar will correspondingly increase the amount of our debt in Pesos, with further adverse effects on our results of operation and financial condition and may increase the collection risk of our leases and other receivables from our tenants and mortgage debtors, most of whom have Peso-denominated revenues. The shift of consumers to purchasing goods over the Internet may negatively affect sales in our shopping centers. During the last years, retail sales by means of the Internet have grown significantly in Argentina, even though the market share of Internet sales related to retail sales is still not significant. The Internet enables manufacturers and retailers to sell directly to consumers, diminishing the importance of traditional distribution channels such as retail stores and shopping centers. We believe that our target consumers are increasingly using the Internet, from home, work or elsewhere, to shop electronically for retail goods, and this trend is likely to continue. If e-commerce and retail sales through the Internet continue to grow, consumers’ reliance on traditional distribution channels such as our shopping centers could be materially diminished, having a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects Risks Related to our Investment in Banco Hipotecario Our investment in Banco Hipotecario is subject to risks affecting Argentina’s financial system. As of June 30, 2011, we owned approximately 29.77% of the outstanding capital stock of Banco Hipotecario (without considering treasury shares) which represented 14.8% of our consolidated assets as of such date. Substantially all of Banco Hipotecario’s operations, properties and customers are located in Argentina. Accordingly, the quality of Banco Hipotecario’s loan portfolio, financial condition and results of operations depend to a significant extent on economic and political conditions prevailing in Argentina. The political and economic crisis in Argentina during 2002 and 2003 and the Argentine government’s actions to address it have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on Banco Hipotecario’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 21 Table of Contents Financial institutions are subject to significant regulation relating to functions that historically have been mandated by the Central Bank and other regulatory authorities. Measures adopted by the Central Bank have had, and future regulations may have, a material adverse effect on Banco Hipotecario’s financial condition and results of operations. Laws and decrees implemented during and after the economic crisis in 2001 and 2002 have substantially altered contractual obligations affecting Argentina’s financial sector. Recently, the Argentine Congress has considered various initiatives intended to reduce or eliminate a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio on the debt owed to Banco Hipotecario. Also, there have been certain initiatives intended to review the terms pursuant to which Banco Hipotecario was privatized. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Argentine legislature will not enact new laws that will have a significant adverse effect on Banco Hipotecario’s shareholders’ equity or that the Argentine government would compensate Banco Hipotecario for the resulting loss. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment in Banco Hipotecario. Over the last calendar year, the financial markets in the most important countries in the world were affected by volatility, lack of liquidity and credit, which entailed a significant drop in international stock indexes, and an economic slow-down started to become evident worldwide. Our management is closely monitoring the effects in order to implement the necessary measures to minimize the impact of the financial crisis on our operations. Banco Hipotecario relies heavily on mortgage lending and the value of our investment in it depends in part on its ability to implement successfully its new business diversification strategy. Historically, Banco Hipotecario has been engaged exclusively in mortgage lending and related activities. As a result, factors having an adverse effect on the mortgage market have a greater adverse impact on Banco Hipotecario than on its more diversified competitors. Due to its historic concentration in this recession-sensitive sector, Banco Hipotecario is particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic and market conditions in Argentina due to their adverse effect on demand for new mortgage loans and the asset quality of outstanding mortgage loans. The past economic crisis had a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, a number of governmental measures that apply to the financial sector have had a material adverse effect particularly on Banco Hipotecario, impairing its financial condition. Accordingly, Banco Hipotecario has adapted its business strategy to confront the challenges of these new market conditions. Banco Hipotecario’s ability to diversify its operation will depend on how successfully it diversifies its product offerings and transforms itself into a financial institution that no longer relies solely on mortgage lending. In the past years Banco Hipotecario has made several investments that are designed to enable it to develop retail banking activities. Banco Hipotecario must overcome significant challenges to achieve this goal including, among others, its lack of experience and client relationships outside the mortgage sector, the existence of large, well-positioned competitors and significant political, regulatory and economic uncertainties in Argentina. As a result, we cannot give you any assurance that Banco Hipotecario will be successful in developing significant retail banking activities in the foreseeable future, if at all. If Banco Hipotecario is unable to diversify its operations by developing its retail banking activities and other non-mortgage banking activities, the value of our substantial investment in Banco Hipotecario would likely be materially and adversely affected. Banco Hipotecario’s mortgage loan portfolio is not adequately indexed for inflation and any significant increase in inflation could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. In accordance with Emergency Decree No. 214/02 and its implementing regulations, pesified assets and liabilities were adjusted for inflation as of February 3, 2002 by application of the Coeficiente de Estabilización de Referencia (“CER”) a consumer price inflation coefficient. On May 6, 2002, the Executive Branch issued a decree providing that mortgages originally denominated in U.S. Dollars and converted into Pesos pursuant to Decree No. 214/2002 and mortgages on property constituting a borrower’s sole family residence may be adjusted for inflation only pursuant to a coefficient based on salary variation, the CVS, which during 2002 was significantly less than inflation as measured by the wholesale price index, or WPI. As a result, only 10% of Banco Hipotecario’s mortgage loans are adjusted for inflation in accordance with the CER, 30% are adjusted in accordance with the CVS and 60% remain entirely unindexed. Additionally, pursuant to Law No. 25,796, Section 1, repealed effective April 1, 2004, the CVS as an indexation mechanism applied to the relevant portion of Banco Hipotecario’s mortgages loans. During 2005, the CER increased to 11.75% and the WPI 10.7%, while in 2006 the CER and WPI increased 10.3% and 7.1%, respectively. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, CER increased 8%, 7% and 11%, respectively, and WPI increased 10%, 1.2% and 14.6% respectively. As of June 30, 2011, CER increased 4.8% and the WPI increased 6.3%. As a result of the high inflation in Argentina from 2002 onwards, Banco Hipotecario’s mortgage loan portfolio experienced a significant decrease in value and if inflation continues increasing, it might continue to undergo a major decrease in value. Accordingly, an increase in Banco Hipotecario’s funding and other costs due to inflation might not be offset by indexation, which could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations. Legislation limiting Banco Hipotecario’s ability to foreclose on mortgaged collateral may have an adverse effect on it. Like other mortgage lenders, the ability to foreclose on mortgaged collateral to recover on delinquent mortgage loans impacts the conduct of Banco Hipotecario’s business. In February 2002, the Argentine government amended Argentina’s Bankruptcy Law, suspending bankruptcies and foreclosures on real estate that constitutes the debtor’s primary residence, initially for a six-month period and subsequently extended until November 14, 2002. Since 2003, the Argentine government has approved various laws that have suspended, in some cases, foreclosures for a period of time in accordance with Law No. 25,972 enacted on December 18, 2004, and, in some cases, temporarily suspended all judicial and non-judicial mortgage and pledge enforcement actions. Several laws and decrees extended this mortgage foreclosure suspension period. Most recently, on June 14, 2006, Argentine Law 26,103 was enacted which established a 180-day suspension period for mortgage foreclosure proceedings affecting debtors where the subject mortgage related to the debtor’s sole residence and where the original loan was not greater than Ps.100,000. Law No. 25,798, enacted November 5, 2003, and implemented by Decrees No. 1284/2003 and No. 352/2004, among others, sets forth a system to restructure delinquent mortgage payments and to prevent foreclosures on a debtor’s sole residence (the “Mortgage Refinancing System”). The Mortgage Refinancing System establishes a trust composed of assets contributed by the Argentine government and income from restructured mortgage loans. Banco de la Nación Argentina, in its capacity as trustee of said trust, enters into debt restructuring agreements with delinquent mortgage debtors establishing the following terms: (i) a grace period on the mortgage loan of one year and (ii) monthly installment payments on the mortgage loan not to exceed 30% of the aggregate income of the family living in the mortgaged property. Banco de la Nación Argentina then subrogates the mortgagee’s rights against the debtor, by issuing notes delivered to the mortgagee to settle the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loan. The sum restructured under the Mortgage Refinancing System may not exceed the appraisal value of the property securing the mortgage after deducting any debts for taxes and maintenance. The Mortgage Refinancing System was established for a limited period of time, during which parties to mortgage loan agreements could opt to participate and was subsequently extended by a number of decrees and laws. 22 Table of Contents Law No. 26,167 enacted on November 29, 2006, suspended foreclosures and also established a special proceeding for the enforcement of certain mortgage loans. Such special proceedings give creditors a 10-day period to inform the court of the amounts owed under the mortgage loans. Soon thereafter, the judge will call the parties for a hearing in order to reach an agreement on the amount and terms of payment thereunder. In case of failure by the parties to reach such agreement, they will have a 30-day negotiation period, and if the negotiations do not result in an agreement, then, payment and conditions will be determined by the courts. On November 29, 2006, Law No. 26,177 created the Unidad de Reestructuración, a government agency responsible for the revision of each of the mortgage loans granted by the state-owned Banco Hipotecario Nacional, the predecessor of Banco Hipotecario, before the enactment of the Convertibility Law in 1991. The Unidad de Reestructuración was authorized to make non-binding recommendations to facilitate the restructuring of such mortgage loans. The Unidad de Reestructuración submitted a proposal to the National Congress recommending forgiveness or other write-off of such loans, extensions of their scheduled maturities or other subsidies that were capable of adversely affecting Banco Hipotecario’s ability to foreclose on such mortgage loans. On November 21, 2007, the National Congress enacted Law No. 26,313, establishing a procedure for the restructuring of certain mortgage loans made by its predecessor, the former Banco Hipotecario Nacional. Law No. 26,313 restructures the affected loans by recalculating and reducing their unpaid balance (which had been previously restructured pursuant to a prior law). In December 2008, the applicability of Law No. 26,313 was limited to certain of Banco Hipotecario’s mortgage loans made prior to April 1, 1991 to finance the construction of residential complexes which as of December 31, 2008, had been delinquent since November 2007 or earlier. As a result of the recalculation of loans, Banco Hipotecario has forgiven its right to enforce 8,317 mortgage loans representing approximately Ps.235.8 million in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2010, Banco Hipotecario had constituted loan allowances in connection with the results of this recalculation. We cannot assure you that the Argentine government will not enact further new laws restricting Banco Hipotecario’s ability to enforce its rights as creditor. Any such limitation on its ability to successfully implement foreclosures could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Banco Hipotecario’s non-mortgage loan portfolio has grown rapidly and is concentrated in the low- and middle-income segments. As a result of Banco Hipotecario’s strategy to diversify its banking operations and develop retail and other non-mortgage banking activities, in recent years its portfolio of non-mortgage loans has grown rapidly. During the period between June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2011, Banco Hipotecario’s portfolio of non-mortgage loans increased 62.0% from Ps.908.4 million to Ps.712.0 million. A substantial portion of its portfolio of non-mortgage loans consists of loans to low- and middle-income individuals and, to a lesser extent, middle-market companies. These individuals and companies are likely to be more seriously affected by adverse developments in the Argentine economy than high income individuals and large corporations. Consequently, in the future Banco Hipotecario may experience higher levels of past due non-mortgage loans that would likely result in increased provisions for loan losses. In addition, large-scale lending to low- and middle-income individuals and middle-market companies is a new business activity for Banco Hipotecario, and as a result its experience and loan-loss data for such loans are necessarily limited. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the levels of past due non-mortgage loans and resulting charge-offs will not increase materially in the future. Given the current valuation criteria of the Central Bank for the recording of government securities on Banco Hipotecario’s balance sheets, its most recent financial statements may not be indicative of its current financial condition. Banco Hipotecario prepares its financial statements in accordance with Central Bank GAAP which differ in certain material respects from Argentine GAAP. As of June 30, 2011 there are included securities that were not valued according to Argentine GAAP equivalent to Ps. 85.5 million. The impact of valuing these securities in accordance with Argentine GAAP results in a decrease in net assets of Ps. 7.3 million at June 30, 2010. Due to interest rate and currency mismatches of its assets and liabilities, Banco Hipotecario has significant currency exposure. As of June 30, 2011, Banco Hipotecario’s foreign currency-denominated liabilities exceeded its foreign-currency-denominated assets by approximately US$ 157.1 million. This currency gap exposes Banco Hipotecario to risk of exchange rate volatility which would negatively affect Banco Hipotecario’s financial results if the U.S. Dollar were to depreciate against the Peso and/or the Euro. We cannot assure you that the U.S. Dollar will not appreciate against the Peso, or that we will not be adversely affected by Banco Hipotecario’s exposure to risks of exchange rate fluctuations. Banco Hipotecario has acquired and will continue to acquire on a regular basis Dollar futures and other derivatives in order to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate mismatches of its assets and liabilities. Banco Hipotecario operates in a highly regulated environment, and its operations are subject to regulations adopted, and measures taken, by the Central Bank, the Comisión Nacional de Valores and other regulatory agencies. Financial institutions are subject to significant regulation relating to functions that historically have been mandated by the Central Bank and other regulatory authorities. Measures adopted by the Central Bank have had, and future regulations may have, a material adverse effect on Banco Hipotecario’s financial condition and results of operations. For example, on July 25, 2003, the Central Bank announced its intention to adopt new capital adjustment requirements which will be gradually implemented until 2009. Furthermore, the IMF and other multilateral agencies encouraged the Government to impose minimum capital adjustment, solvency and liquidity requirements, in accordance with the international guidelines, which may produce significant operating restrictions on Banco Hipotecario. Similarly, the Comisión Nacional de Valores, which authorizes Banco Hipotecario’s offerings of securities and regulates the public markets in Argentina, has the authority to impose sanctions on Banco Hipotecario and its board of directors for breaches of corporate governance requirements. Under applicable law, the Comisión Nacional de Valores has the authority to impose penalties that range from minor regulatory enforcement sanctions to significant monetary fines, to disqualification of directors from performing board functions for a period of time, and (in the most serious cases) prohibiting issuers from making public offerings, if they were to determine that there was wrongdoing or material violation of law. Although Banco Hipotecario is not currently party to any proceeding before the Comisión Nacional de Valores, we cannot assure you that the Comisión Nacional de Valores will not initiate new proceedings against Banco Hipotecario, its shareholders´ or directors or impose further sanctions. 23 Table of Contents Commencing in early 2002, laws and decrees have been implemented that have substantially altered the prevailing legal regime and obligations established in contract. In the recent past, various initiatives have been presented to Congress intended to reduce or eliminate the debt owed to Banco Hipotecario on a portion of its mortgage loan portfolio and there were initiatives intended to review the terms pursuant to which Banco Hipotecario Nacional was privatized. As a result, we cannot assure you that the legislative branch will not enact new laws that will have a significant adverse impact on Banco Hipotecario’s shareholders’ equity or that, if this were to occur, the Argentine government would compensate us for the resulting loss. Please see “Exchange Rates and Exchange Controls”. The Argentine government may prevail in all matters to be decided at a Banco Hipotecario’s general shareholders meeting. According to the Privatization Law and Banco Hipotecario’s by-laws, holders of Class A and Class D Shares have special voting rights relating to certain corporate decisions. Whenever such special rights do not apply (with respect to the Class A Shares and the Class D Shares) and in all cases (with respect to the Class B Shares and the Class C Shares), each share of common shares entitles the holder to one vote. Pursuant to Argentine regulations, Banco Hipotecario may not issue new shares with multiple votes. The holders of Class D Shares have the right to elect nine of Banco Hipotecario’s board members and their respective alternates. In addition, for so long as Class A Shares represent more than 42.0% of Banco Hipotecario’s capital, the Class D Shares shall be entitled to three votes per share, provided that holders of Class D Shares will be entitled to only one vote per share in the case of a vote on: · a fundamental change in Banco Hipotecario’s corporate purpose; · a change in Banco Hipotecario’s domicile outside of Argentina; · dissolution prior to the expiration of Banco Hipotecario’s corporate existence; · a merger or spin-off after which Banco Hipotecario would not be the surviving corporation; · a total or partial recapitalization following a mandatory reduction of capital; and · approval of voluntary reserves, other than legally mandated reserves, when their amount exceeds Banco Hipotecario’s capital stock and its legally mandated reserves. In addition, irrespective of what percentage of Banco Hipotecario’s outstanding capital stock is represented by Class A Shares, the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Shares is required to adopt certain decisions. Class D Shares will not be converted into Class A Shares, Class B Shares or Class C Shares by virtue of their reacquisition by the Argentine government, PPP or Programa de Propiedad Participada (or the Shared Property Program) participants or companies engaged in housing development or real estate activities. According to the Privatization Law, there are no restrictions on the ability of the Argentine government to dispose of its Class A shares, and all but one of such shares could be sold to third parties in a public offering. If the Class A shares represent less than 42% of Banco Hipotecario’s total voting stock as a result of the issuance of new shares other than Class A shares or otherwise, the Class D shares we hold would automatically lose their triple voting rights. If this were to occur, we would likely lose its current ability, together with our affiliates that also hold Class D shares of Banco Hipotecario, to exercise substantial influence over decisions submitted to the vote of Banco Hipotecario’s shareholders. Banco Hipotecario will continue to consider acquisition opportunities which may not be successful. From time to time in recent years, Banco Hipotecario has considered certain possible acquisitions or business combinations, and Banco Hipotecario expects to continue considering acquisitions that it believes offer attractive opportunities and are consistent with its business strategy. We cannot assure you, however, that Banco Hipotecario will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that Banco Hipotecario will be able to acquire promising target financial institutions on favorable terms. Additionally, its ability to obtain the desired effects of past and future acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to successfully complete the integration of those businesses. The integration of acquired businesses entails significant risks, including: · unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems; · problems assimilating or retaining the employees of acquired businesses; · challenges retaining customers of acquired businesses; · unexpected liabilities or contingencies relating to the acquired businesses; and · the possibility that management may be distracted from day-to-day business concerns by integration activities and related problem solving. 24 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Global Depositary Shares and the Shares Shares eligible for sale could adversely affect the price of our common shares and Global Depositary Shares. The market prices of our common shares and GDS could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of common shares or GDSs in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. The GDSs are freely transferable under US securities laws, including shares sold to our affiliates. Cresud, which as of September 30, 2011, owned approximately 63.2 % of our common shares (or approximately 365,815,965 common shares which may be exchanged for an aggregate of 36,581,596 GDSs), is free to dispose of any or all of its common shares or GDSs at any time in its discretion. Sales of a large number of our common shares and/or GDSs would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and the GDS. We are subject to certain different corporate disclosure requirements and accounting standards than domestic issuers of listed securities in the United States There may be less publicly available information about the issuers of securities listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange (the “Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires”) than publicly available information about domestic issuers of listed securities in the United States and certain other countries. In addition, all listed Argentine companies must prepare their financial statements in accordance with regulations of the CNV and Argentine GAAP except for financial institutions and insurance companies which must comply with the accounting standards issued by BCRA and the National Insurance Superintendance, respectively, which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. For this and other reasons, the presentation of Argentine financial statements and reported earnings may differ from that of companies in other countries in this and other respects. We are exempted from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempted from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Investors may not be able to effect service of process within the U.S. limiting their recovery of any foreign judgment. We are a publicly held corporation (sociedad anónima) organized under the laws of Argentina. Most of our directors and our senior managers, and most of our assets are located in Argentina. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such persons or to enforce against us or them, in United States courts, judgments obtained in such courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws. We have been advised by our Argentine counsel, Zang, Bergel & Viñes, that there is doubt as to whether the Argentine courts will enforce to the same extent and in as timely a manner as a US or foreign court, an action predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws or other foreign regulations brought against such persons or against us. If we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of our common shares or GDSs would suffer negative consequences. Based on the current and projected composition of our income and the valuation of our assets, including goodwill, we do not believe we were a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for United States federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending June 30, 2011, and we do not currently expect to become a PFIC, although there can be no assurance in this regard. The determination of whether we are a PFIC is made annually. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be a PFIC in the current or any future taxable year due to changes in our asset or income composition or if our projections are not accurate. The volatility and instability of Argentina’s economic and financial system may substantially affect the composition of our income and assets and the accuracy of our projections. In addition, this determination is based on the interpretation of certain U.S. Treasury regulations relating to rental income, which regulations are potentially subject to differing interpretation. If we become a PFIC, U.S. Holders (as defined in “Taxation – United States Taxation”) of our common shares or GDSs will be subject to certain United States federal income tax rules that have negative consequences for U.S. Holders such as additional tax and an interest charge upon certain distributions by us or upon a sale or other disposition of our common shares or GDSs at a gain, as well as additional reporting requirements. Please see “Taxation – United States Taxation – Passive Foreign Investment Company” for a more detailed discussion of the consequences if we are deemed a PFIC. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to your particular circumstances. Under Argentine law, shareholder rights may be fewer or less well defined than in other jurisdictions. Our corporate affairs are governed by our by-laws and by Argentine corporate law, which differ from the legal principles that would apply if we were incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, such as the States of Delaware or New York, or in other jurisdictions outside Argentina. In addition, your rights or the rights of holders of our common shares to protect your or their interests in connection with actions by our board of directors may be fewer and less well defined under Argentine corporate law than under the laws of those other jurisdictions. Although insider trading and price manipulation are illegal under Argentine law, the Argentine securities markets are not as highly regulated or supervised as the US securities markets or markets in some other jurisdictions. In addition, rules and policies against self dealing and regarding the preservation of shareholder interests may be less well defined and enforced in Argentina than in the United States, putting holders of our common shares and GDSs at a potential disadvantage. The protections afforded to minority shareholders in Argentina are different from and more limited than those in the United States and may be more difficult to enforce. Under Argentine law, the protections afforded to minority shareholders are different from, and much more limited than, those in the United States and some other Latin American countries. For example, the legal framework with respect to shareholder disputes, such as derivative lawsuits and class actions, is less developed under Argentine law than under U.S. law as a result of Argentina’s short history with these types of claims and few successful cases. In addition, there are different procedural requirements for bringing these types of shareholder lawsuits. As a result, it may be more difficult for our minority shareholders to enforce their rights against us or our directors or controlling shareholder than it would be for shareholders of a US company. Holders of common shares may determine to not pay any dividends. In accordance with Argentine corporate law we may pay dividends to shareholders out of net and realized profits, if any, as set forth in our audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Argentine GAAP. The approval, amount and payment of dividends are subject to the approval by our shareholders at our annual ordinary shareholders meeting. The approval of dividends requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate enough net and realized profits so as to pay dividends or that our shareholders will decide that dividends will be paid. 25 Table of Contents Our ability to pay dividends is limited by law, by our by-laws and by certain restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. In accordance with Argentine corporate law, we may pay dividends in Pesos only out of retained earnings, if any, to the extent set forth in our audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Argentine GAAP. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common shares is limited by certain restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. On February 2, 2007, we issued our 8.5% notes due 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of US$150.0 million`. These notes contain a covenant limiting our ability to pay dividends which may not exceed the sum of: · 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income; or · 75% of our cumulative consolidated net income if our consolidated interest coverage ratio for our most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters is at least 3.0 to 1; or · 100% of cumulative consolidated net income if our consolidated interest coverage ratio for our most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters is at least 4.0 to 1; or · 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds (with certain exceptions) and the fair market value of property other than cash received by us or by our restricted subsidiaries from (a) any contribution to our capital stock or the capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries or issuance and sale of our qualified capital stock or the qualified capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries subsequent to the issue of our notes due 2017, (b) issuance and sale subsequent to the issuance of our notes due 2017 or our indebtedness or the indebtedness of our restricted subsidiaries that has been converted into or exchanged for our qualified capital stock, or (c) any reduction in our indebtedness or any restricted subsidiary, (d) any reduction in debt investment (other than permitted investments) and return on assets, or (e) any distribution received from non-restricted subsidiaries. On July 20, 2010, we issued our Series II 11.5% notes due in 2020 in an aggregate principal amount of US$ 150.0 million. These notes are subject to the same covenants as described above for our 8.5% notes due 2017. As a result, we cannot give you any assurance that in the future we will pay any dividends in respect of our common shares.
