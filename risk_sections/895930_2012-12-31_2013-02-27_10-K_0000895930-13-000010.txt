Item 1A. Risk Factors â€“ (continued) 1993 to a related party. On January 25, 2000, the IRS issued final regulations that continue to call into question the deductibility of goodwill purchased in transactions structured similarly to some of our acquisitions. This uncertainty applies only to goodwill that arose in part prior to 1993, so the tax deductions we have taken with respect to interests acquired in surgery centers that were formed after August 10, 1993 are not affected. In response to these final regulations, in 2000 we changed our methods of acquiring interests in ASCs so as to comply with guidance found in the final regulations. There is a risk that the IRS could challenge tax deductions for pre-1993 goodwill in acquisitions we completed prior to changing our approach. Loss of these tax deductions would increase the amount of our tax payments and could subject us to interest and penalties. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
