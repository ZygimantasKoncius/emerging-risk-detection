Risk Factors Relating to Us-Difficult market conditions in the automotive industry may affect our operating margins and results of operations." As a result, our sales to automobile manufacturers could lead to additional price pressures and a loss of sales volumes. At the same time, this business unit has shown some price stability in recent months in its Mexican construction glass markets, where in the past we experienced the greatest pricing pressures. Although these pricing pressures have receded to some extent, we cannot anticipate how the prices will fluctuate in the future. In the first quarter of 2007, higher construction-related export sales partially offset lower domestic construction-related volumes. In addition, automotive sales decreased driven by lower domestic and export OEM volumes due to a slowdown in purchases from one of our main clients, the available capacity was used to supply both the domestic and export AGR markets. This effect was partially compensated by the solid upward trend from the Flat Glass' foreign subsidiaries (Vitro America, Vitro Colombia and Vitro Cristalglass). The increase in the price of certain of our raw materials, in particular natural gas, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. NYMEX natural gas prices have increased from an average price of $3.22 per MMBTU during 2002 to an average price of $7.23 per MMBTU during 2006, representing an increase of 125%. Furthermore, as the price of natural gas has significantly increased in recent years, we have not been able to raise our products' prices to fully reflect these increases, which in turn have adversely affected our results of operations and liquidity. Economic Developments in Mexico and the United States Affect our Business A substantial portion of our operations are in Mexico and a substantial majority of our consolidated net sales are made in Mexico and the United States. Therefore, economic conditions in Mexico and the United States have a significant effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 2006 was a year of moderate global economic growth. The economies of Mexico and the United States-our two biggest markets-recorded actual GDP growth in 2006 of 4.7% and 3.3%, respectively, compared with growth of 3.0% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2005. Mexico's economic growth was mainly driven by the increase in oil prices. Analysts, however, continue to view the pace of growth as weak, largely due to Mexico's lack of progress on structural reforms. Over the past few years, Mexico's rate of inflation has remained low, amounting to 3.3% in 2005 and 4.05% in 2006. The majority of our manufacturing facilities are located in Mexico. For each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, 44%, 42%, and 43%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales resulted from sales to parties located within Mexico. While helping the country to maintain low levels of inflation and a manageable deficit, the Mexican government's continued fiscal and monetary policy does not provide the flexibility necessary to support Mexico's economic improvement. As a result, new investment and growth in aggregate purchasing power have been marginal. Several factors could affect the growth of Mexico's economy and its industrial sector. These factors include (i) the extent of the U.S. economic recovery and the participation of Mexico's industrial sector in that recovery and (ii) the Mexican government's approval and implementation of fiscal and other structural reforms such as the evolution of energy prices, particularly natural gas. In spite of these political and economic dynamics, we will continue to focus on the factors within our control and position ourselves to take full advantage of new market opportunities. Inflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain information relating to inflation and foreign currency exchange rates: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Nominal peso devaluation (appreciation) relative to the U.S. dollar(1) (0.8%) (4.6%) 1.7% Mexican inflation (based on changes in INPC) (1) 5.2% 3.3% 4.1% U.S. inflation (based on changes in Consumer Price Index)(2) 3.3% 3.5% 2.5% Inflation differential (Mexican vs. U.S.)(1)(2)(3) 1.8% (0.2%) 1.6% Real peso devaluation (appreciation) relative to the U.S. dollar(4) (2.6%) (4.5%) 0.1% Free Exchange Rate as of year end(1) Ps.11.1495 Ps.10.6344 Ps.10.8116 Mexican GDP growth rate(5) 4.2% 3.0% 4.7% Exchange rate euro per peso as of year end(6) Ps.15.0941 Ps.12.5932 Ps.14.2680 (1) Source: Banco de Mexico.

Effects of Inflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations on Operating Margins Changes in the relative value of the peso to the U.S. dollar have an effect on our results of operations. In general, as described more fully in the following paragraphs, a real devaluation of the peso will likely result in an increase in our operating margins and a real appreciation of the peso will likely result in a decrease in our operating margins, in each case, when measured in pesos. This is because the aggregate amount of our consolidated net sales denominated in or affected by U.S. dollars exceeds the aggregate amount of our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses denominated in or affected by U.S. dollars. A substantial portion of the sales generated by our Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries are either denominated in or affected by the value of the U.S. dollar. The prices of a significant number of the products we sell in Mexico, in particular those of flat glass for automotive uses and capital goods, are linked to the U.S. dollar. In addition, substantially all of our export sales are invoiced in U.S. dollars and subsequently translated into pesos using the exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. The translated U.S. dollar sales of our Mexican subsidiaries are then restated into constant pesos using INPC, as of the date of the most recent balance sheet included in those financial statements. As a result, when the peso devalues in real terms against the U.S. dollar, as was the case in 2003 and 2006, the same level of U.S. dollar sales as in a prior period will result in higher constant peso revenues in the more recent period. Conversely, when the peso appreciates in real terms against the U.S. dollar, as was the case in 2004 and 2005, the same level of U.S. dollar sales as in a prior period will result in lower constant peso revenues in the more recent period. Moreover, because a material portion of our cost of goods sold, including labor costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses are invoiced in pesos and are not directly affected by the relative value of the peso to the U.S. dollar, the real appreciation or devaluation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar has a significant effect on our operating margins, at least in the short term. Further, a strong peso relative to the U.S. dollar makes the Mexican market more attractive for importers and competitors that might not otherwise sell in the Mexican market. A strong peso relative to the U.S. dollar also makes those of our products whose prices are denominated in or are affected by the value of the U.S. dollar less competitive or profitable. When the peso appreciates in real terms, with respect to such products, we must either increase our prices in U.S. dollars, which make our products less price-competitive, or bear reduced operating margins when measured in pesos. Given the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate, in the past we have chosen to reduce our operating margins for such products in response to appreciation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the appreciation of the peso in real terms had an adverse effect on our operating margins and, while the peso did not appreciate in the year ended December 31, 2006, it may appreciate again in the future, potentially resulting in an adverse effect on our operating margins. Sales of products manufactured, processed or sold by us outside Mexico (principally by Vitro America, Vitro Packaging, Comegua, and Vitro Cristalglass), as well as such subsidiaries' expenses, are restated during a financial reporting period by adjusting such amount for the inflation observed in the country in which the subsidiary operates and then translated into pesos at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Since such subsidiaries' revenues and expenses are generally both earned and incurred in the same currency, the devaluation or appreciation of the peso has a much more limited effect on the operating margins of such subsidiaries. However, profits, as reported in real peso terms, are substantially impacted by the devaluation or appreciation of the peso relative to the appropriate currency. Effect of Inflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations on Total Financing Cost Our total financing cost includes (i) net interest expense, (ii) the net effect of inflation on our monetary assets and liabilities, (iii) the net effect of changes in nominal foreign currency exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and (iv) since 2005, due to the implementation of Bulletin C-10, "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities," of MIPA, gains or losses related to hedging transactions. Net interest expense is calculated as the nominal amount of interest expense incurred by us with respect to our short- and long-term debt and off-balance sheet financings, minus the nominal amount of interest income generated by us with respect to our monetary assets. Inflation affects our total financing cost. During periods of inflation, the principal amount of our monetary debt will generally be reduced in real terms by the rate of inflation. The amount of such reduction will result in a gain from monetary position. This gain is offset by the reduction in real terms in the value of the monetary assets we held during such period. Historically, our monetary liabilities have exceeded our monetary assets and, thus, we have tended to experience monetary gains during periods of inflation. Declining levels of inflation in recent years have resulted in lower monetary gains. Our total financing cost is also impacted by changes in the nominal value of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange gains or losses included in total financing cost result primarily from the impact of nominal changes in the U.S. dollar-peso exchange rate on our and our Mexican subsidiaries' U.S. dollar-denominated monetary liabilities (such as dollar-denominated debt and accounts payable arising from imports of raw materials and equipment) and assets (such as dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable from exports). Because our U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities have historically been significantly in excess of our dollar-denominated monetary assets, the devaluation or appreciation of the peso resulted in exchange losses and gains, respectively. Accordingly, in 2006, the nominal devaluation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar resulted in foreign currency exchange losses. The nominal appreciation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar resulted in a foreign currency exchange gain in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, with the unwinding of certain currency exchange swaps in May 2004, we recorded a net exchange loss. Results of Operations On June 16, 2006, we completed the sale of our 51% equity ownership interest in Vitrocrisa to Libbey, the owner of the remaining 49% equity interest. Vitrocrisa, which was previously presented as one of our reportable segments is presented as discontinued operation as its disposition represents the end of a significant activity of the Company. Accordingly, all financial and operating information relating to Vitrocrisa in this annual report are presented as a discontinued operation. The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, selected items of our consolidated statement of operations calculated as a percentage of our consolidated net sales.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales Our consolidated net sales increased 5.0% to Ps. 26,562 million ($2,457 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from Ps. 25,323 million ($2,342 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, domestic and foreign subsidiaries' sales grew 8.7% and 11.1%, respectively year-over-year, as a result of strong sales volumes at the Flat Glass and Glass Containers business units. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our consolidated export sales were $556 million (Ps. 6,127 million), a decrease of 5.4% when compared to $588 million (Ps.6,710 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in exports is mainly due to lower AGR and construction-related sales, as we plan to temporarily exit this export market. Our export sales represented 23.1% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. Glass Containers Business Unit Net sales of our Glass Containers business unit increased 13% to Ps. 13,518 million ($1,250 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from Ps. 12,002 million ($1,110 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Strong volumes across all business lines in the domestic market continued to be the main driver behind the 7.9% increase year-over-year. In particular, sales volume of beverage containers including beer, wine, liquor and CFT were the largest contributors to the increase. Export sales grew 18.3% year-over-year due to a strong rise in sales volumes at the CFT business line as a result of increased demand in the South American and European markets and larger volumes coupled with an improved price mix at the wine and liquor business line. Flat Glass Business Unit Net sales of our Flat Glass business unit were Ps. 12,710 million ($1,176 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of 1.9% when compared to Ps. 12,960 million ($1,199 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to a decrease in export sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in domestic sales of 14.4% year-over-year, mainly as a result of higher automotive and construction-related sales. In addition, construction-related sales volume increased 12% year-over-year. Export sales decreased 30.3% year-over-year due to lower AGR and construction-related sales, as we plan to temporarily exit this lower margin export market and focus our efforts on domestic sales. The reduction in AGR export sales was driven by a decrease in volume as capacity was used to supply the OEM market, although this effect was partially offset by an improved product mix. Construction-related export sales decreased as we continued to focus on the Mexican market. Automotive sales decreased 2.1% year-over-year, driven by lower sales volume in the AGR market. This effect was partially offset by the success of current OEM platforms. Sales from foreign subsidiaries continued an upward trend, increasing 5.9% year-over-year to $662 million from $625 million. Sales at Vitro America rose 2.8% as a result of increased construction-related volumes. Sales at Vitro Colombia rose 1.2% while Vitro Cristalglass' sales rose 8.3% driven by incremental large-scale contracts coupled with an improved product mix. Operating Income Our consolidated operating income increased 14.9% to Ps. 2,010 million ($186 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from Ps. 1,749 million ($162 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005, mainly due to increased sales and production efficiencies in our Glass Containers business unit. Glass Containers Business Unit Operating income of our Glass Containers business unit increased 39.5% to Ps. 1,782 million ($165 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from Ps. 1,277 million ($118 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Growth in operating income was driven by higher sales volume, a better product mix due to unseasonably high demand for glass containers and improved production efficiencies which optimized fixed cost absorption. These factors more than offset higher maintenance costs associated with the utilization of all our furnaces to meet this demand, as well as higher energy costs. Additionally, all furnaces were ignited in the first quarter of 2006, compared to the second quarter of 2005. This had a positive effect on our operating income. Flat Glass Business Unit Operating income of our Flat Glass business unit was Ps. 375 million ($35 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of 20.8% when compared to Ps. 474 million ($44 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was due to the temporary shutdown of the furnace located in Mexico City. Higher volumes in domestic construction and value-added automotive OEM products helped offset the decrease. Vitro America and Vitro Cristalglass also continued to generate strong operating income, with increases 36.3% and 53.2%, respectively. Total Financing Result Our total financing result increased 52% from Ps. 1,441 million ($133 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005 to Ps. 2,189 million ($202 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to a non-cash foreign-exchange loss of Ps. 215 million ($20 million) during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a non-cash foreign-exchange gain of Ps. 402 million ($37 million) in the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting from a depreciation of the peso by 1.7% during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with a 4.6% appreciation in the year ended December 31, 2005. Additionally, an increase in other financial expenses driven mainly by the negative effect of derivative transactions, which increased from a charge of Ps. 16 million ($1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005 to Ps. 325 million ($30 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006, which more than offset a 9.4% reduction in interest expense. Other (Income) Expenses, Net Other expenses, net decreased Ps. 697 million ($64 million) to a gain of Ps. (273) million ($(25) million) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from a loss of Ps. 424 million ($39 million) for the year ended December 31, 2005, mainly due to (i) the gain from sale of long-lived assets of Ps. (766) million ($(71) million); (ii) the gain from sale of other subsidiaries of Ps. (66) million ($(6) million) (see "Item
