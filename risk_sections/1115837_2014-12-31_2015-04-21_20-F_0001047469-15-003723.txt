Ukraine operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased by 21.7% to RUB 11,745 million from RUB 9,647 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Ukraine operating income increased as a percentage of Ukraine revenues to 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013, from 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012. These increases were largely due to the growth in Ukraine revenues by 5.3% and the simultaneous decline of depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of Ukraine revenues to 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 25.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as explained above. Other countries and business activities operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2013, amounted to RUB 4,810 million, while other countries and business activities operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012, was RUB 7,626 million. The decrease in other countries and business activities operating loss was attributable to the fact that we resumed our operations in Turkmenistan in the second half of 2012 with the subsequent growth of other countries and business activities revenues. The decline was also reduced due to the release of damages, interest and other costs that had been provided for in relation to the dispute with Nomihold. Currency exchange and transaction gains/losses Consolidated currency exchange and transaction loss for the year ended December 31, 2013, was RUB 5,473 million, compared to the gains of 3,952 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. We conduct our operations within the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkmenistan and Armenia, and we are therefore subject to currency fluctuations. The local currencies of these countries fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar and euro during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the currency exchange and transaction gains/losses we incurred were primarily due to the translation effect of our U.S. dollar and euro-denominated debt as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The losses recognized in 2013 as compared to gains recorded in 2012 were mainly due to the depreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar and euro during the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to 2012. Interest expense Consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, decreased by RUB 2,175 million, or 12.3%, to RUB 15,498 million from RUB 17,673 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the decrease in our total indebtedness, revision of interest rates during 2013 as well as raising credit funds at more attractive rates. Equity in net income of associates Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased by RUB 1,603 million, or 184.5%, to a gain of RUB 2,472 million, compared to a gain of RUB 869 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase results mainly from income growth of our equity investee in in Belarus during the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, in April 2013, we acquired a 25.0945% stake in MTS Bank, consolidated equity in net income of MTS Bank for the year ended December 31, 2013 amounted to RUB 229 million. 174 Table of Contents Other expenses (income), net Consolidated other income for the year ended December 31, 2013, amounted to RUB 10,636 million, as compared to RUB 687 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to the release of the provision to exercise the put option for acquisition of the remaining 49% stake in Bitel and the release of damages, interest and other costs that had been provided for in relation to the dispute with Nomihold. Provision for income taxes Consolidated provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased by 1.3% to RUB 19,633 million from RUB 19,384 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The effective tax rate decreased to 20.3% in the year ended December 31, 2013, from 23.4% in the year ended December 31, 2012 mainly as a result of earnings distributions from subsidiaries, effect of the lower tax rates of subsidiaries and other items not liable for tax purposes. Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2013 remained relatively stable and amounted to RUB 949 million compared to net income attributable to the non-controlling interest of RUB 970 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net income attributable to the Group Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by 50,197 million, or 169%, to RUB 79,839 million, compared to RUB 29,642 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 20.0% in the year ended December 31, 2013, and 7.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012. Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, increased due to the overall growth of consolidated revenues by 5.3%, recognition of other income in the amount of RUB 12,147 million attributable to the release of the provision retaling to the exercise of the put option to acquire the remaining 49% stake in Bitel and the release of provisions for damages, interest and other costs that had been provided for in relation to the dispute with Nomihold. Another reason for the growth of net income was the recognition of gain in the amount of RUB 3,733 million related to discontinued operations in Uzbekistan in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the loss in the amount of RUB 32,846 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2012. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our borrowings consist of notes and bank loans. Since 2001, we have raised a total of $3.0 billion (RUB 92.8 billion at the date of transactions) through seven U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured bond offerings in the international capital markets, as well as ruble-denominated bonds totaling RUB 96 billion. Our bank loans consist of U.S. dollar-, euro-, Armenian dram-, Uzbek som- and ruble- denominated borrowings totaling approximately RUB 176.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. We repaid approximately RUB 52.6 billion of indebtedness in 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the total amount available to us under our credit facilities amounted to RUB 44.4 billion. We had total indebtedness of approximately RUB 292.4 billion as of December 31, 2014, including capital lease obligations, compared to approximately RUB 219.1 billion as of December 31, 2013. Our total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, was RUB 15.5 billion and RUB 16.5 billion, net of amounts capitalized, respectively. See Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our indebtedness. 175 Table of Contents Capital Requirements We need capital to finance the following:  capital expenditures, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;  acquisitions;  repayment of debt and related interest payments;  changes in working capital; and  general corporate activities, including dividends. We anticipate that capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of long- term debt and dividends will represent the most significant uses of funds for several years to come. Our cash outlays for capital expenditures in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were RUB 87,783 million, RUB 81,575 million and RUB 92,599 million, respectively. We expect to continue to finance most of our capital expenditure needs through our operating cash flows, and to the extent required, to incur additional indebtedness through borrowings or additional capital raising activities. Historically, a significant portion of our capital expenditures have been related to the installation and build-out of our network and expansion into new license areas. We expect that capital expenditures will remain a large portion of our cash outflows in connection with the continued installation and build-out of our network. We expect our total capital expenditures in 2015 to be approximately 20% of our total 2014 revenue. These investments are required to support the growth in our subscriber base (i.e., to improve network capacity), to maintain and modernize our mobile and fixed line networks, to develop our network in the regions and to continue with the roll out of LTE networks throughout Russia as well as the development of our proprietary retail chain in Russia. We expect that the development of LTE networks will be among our most significant capital expenditures and require considerable management resources. See "
