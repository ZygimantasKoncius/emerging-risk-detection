ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Due to the nature of our business, we do not have significant amounts of recurring revenues from our existing customers and we are highly dependent on new business development. Most of our revenues derive from the installation of security and surveillance systems which are generally non-recurring. Our customers are primarily governmental entities, non-profit organizations and commercial entities, such as airports, customs agencies, hotels, real estate developments, banks, mines, railways, supermarkets, and entertainment enterprises. We manufacture and install security systems for these customers and generate revenues from the sale of these systems to our customers and, to a lesser extent, from maintenance of these systems for our customers. After we have manufactured and installed a system at any particular customer site, we have generated the majority of revenues from that particular client. We would not expect to generate significant revenues from any existing client in future years unless that client has additional installatio n sites for which our services might be required. Therefore, in order to maintain a level of revenues each year that is at or in excess of the level of revenues we generated in prior years, we must identify and be retained by new clients. If our business development, marketing and sales techniques do not result in an equal or greater number of projects of at least comparable size and value for us in a given year compared to the prior year, then we may be unable to increase our revenues and earnings or even sustain current levels in the future. In order to grow at the pace expected by management, we will require additional capital to support our long-term business plan. If we are unable to obtain additional capital in future years, we may be unable to proceed with our long-term business plan and we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. We will require additional working capital to support our long-term business plan, which includes identifying suitable targets for horizontal or vertical mergers or acquisitions, so as to enhance the overall productivity and benefit from economies of scale. Our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities, if any, will vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the volume of business during the period and payment terms with our customers. We may not be able to obtain adequate levels of additional financing, whether through equity financing, debt financing or other sources. Additional financings could result in significant dilution to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities with rights superior to our current outstanding securities. In addition, we may grant registration rights to investors purc hasing our equity or debt securities in the future. If we are unable to raise additional financing, we may be unable to implement our long-term business plan, develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, a lack of additional financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations. We sometimes extend credit to our customers. Failure to collect the trade receivables or untimely collection could affect our liquidity. We extend credit to a large number of our customers while generally requiring no collateral. Generally, our customers pay in installments, with a portion of the payment upfront, a portion of the payment upon receipt of our products by our customers and before the installation, and a portion of the payment after the installation of our products and upon satisfaction of our customer. Sometimes, a small portion of the payment will not be paid until after a certain period following the installation. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally have no difficulties in collecting our payments. However, if we encounter future problems collecting amounts due from our clients or if we experience delays in the collection of amounts due from our clients, our liquidity could be negatively affected. If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our ability to provide services and products to our customers, as well as our ability to obtain future business, may be harmed. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services that we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by those subcontractors. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations to our customers, could expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. - -12- If we are unable to attract and retain senior management and qualified technical and sales personnel, our operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected. Our future success depends in part on the contributions of our management team and key technical and sales personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified new personnel. In particular, our success depends on the continuing employment of our CEO, Mr. Guoshen Tu; our CFO, Mr. Terence Yap; our President, Mr. Shufang Yang and our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Daiyou Qian. There is significant competition in our industry for qualified managerial, technical and sales personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key senior managerial, technical and sales personnel or that we will be able to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that we may require in the future. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel in the future, our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Our growths strategy includes making acquisitions in the future, which could subject us to significant risks, any of which could harm our business. Our growth strategy includes identifying and acquiring or investing in suitable candidates on acceptable terms. During the last 12 months, we acquired a 100% ownership interest in Hongtianzhi, HiEasy, Minking and Tsingvision. In addition, we established an exclusive cooperation relationship with Chuang Guan. We have also entered into letters of intent to acquire several other companies. Over time, we may acquire or make investments in other providers of products that complement our business and other companies in the security industry. The successful integration of these companies and any other acquired businesses require us to: • integrate and retain key management, sales, research and development, production and other personnel; • incorporate the acquired products or capabilities into our offerings from an engineering, sales and marketing perspective; • coordinate research and development efforts; • integrate and support pre-existing supplier, distribution and customer relationships; and • consolidate duplicate facilities and functions and combine back office accounting, order processing and support functions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: • diversion of managements attention from running our existing business; • increased expenses, including travel, legal, administrative and compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees; • increased costs to integrate personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired company with our own; • adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write-down of goodwill associated with acquisitions; • potential disputes with sellers of acquired businesses, technologies, services, products and potential liabilities; and • dilution to our earnings per share if we issue common stock in any acquisition. Moreover, performance problems with an acquired business, technology, product or service could also have a material adverse impact on our reputation as a whole. Any acquired business, technology, product or service could significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our acquisitions. Geographic distance between business operations, the compatibility of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures being combined also presents significant challenges. Acquired businesses are likely to have different standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies, making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company-wide financial, accounting, billing, information and other systems. If we cannot overcome these challenges, we may not realize actual benefits fr om past and future acquisitions, which will impair our overall business results. Our acquisition strategy also depends on our ability to obtain necessary government approvals, as described under "Risks Related to Doing Business in China we may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations which became effective on September 8, 2006." - -13- Due to our rapid growth in recent years, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance so evaluating our business and prospects may be difficult. Our business has grown and evolved rapidly in recent years as demonstrated by our growth in sales revenue from approximately $32.7 million in 2005 to $107.0 million in 2006, and $240.2 million in 2007. We may not be able to achieve similar growth in future periods, and our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business, financial performance and prospects. Therefore, you should not rely on our past results or our historical rate of growth as an indication of our future performance. Our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. A successful challenge to the ownership of our technology could materially damage our business prospects. Our competitors may assert that our technologies or products infringe on their patents or proprietary rights. We may be required to obtain from others licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Problems with intellectual property rights could increase the cost of our products or delay or preclude our new product development and commercialization. If infringement claims against us are deemed valid, we may not be able to obtain appropriate licenses on acceptable terms or at all. Litigation could be costly and time-consuming but may be necessary to pro tect our technology license positions or to defend against infringement claims. We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and make sales in China, which may experience corruption. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. The discontinuation of the preferential tax treatment currently available to our PRC subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, established in the PRC are generally subject to an enterprise income tax, or EIT, rate of 33.0%, which includes a 30.0% state income tax and a 3.0% local income tax. FIEs established in Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, such as our Chinese subsidiary Golden is subject to an EIT rate of 15% for the fiscal year 2007. Our subsidiary Cheng Feng is subject to an EIT rate of 15% for fiscal year 2007 due to the software and high technology company status. Our subsidiary Hongtianzhi is located in Shenzhen and its corporate tax rate is 7.5% as it receives lower tax rate as a high-tech company. HiEasy, Minking and Tsingvision are subject to an EIT rate of 0% since the date of acquisition because their holding companies are foreign companies. On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress of China passed the new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed the Implementing Rules for the EIT Law, or Implementing Rules, which take effect on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law and Implementing Rules impose a unified EIT of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and FIEs, unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. Therefore, nearly all FIEs are subject to the new tax rate alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the FEIT, and its associated preferential tax treatments, beginning January 1, 2008. Despite these pending changes, the EIT Law gives existing FIEs a five-year grandfather period during which they can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatments. We are expecting that the measures to implement the grandfather period will be enacted by the Chinese government in the coming months and we will assess what the impact of the new regulations are at that time. The discontinuation of any such special or preferential tax treatment or other incentives would have an adverse affect on any organizations business, fiscal condition and current operations in China. - -14- In addition to the changes to the current tax structure, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an EIT of 25.0% on its global income. The Implementing Rules define the term de facto management bodies as an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise. If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that the Company should be classified as a resident enterprise, then the organizations global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25.0%. Safetech is a BVI company, while our operating subsidiaries are PRC companies, and all of our officers and directors reside outside the United States. Therefore, certain judgments obtained against our Company by our shareholders may not be enforceable in the BVI or China. Safetech is a BVI company and our operating subsidiaries Golden, Cheng Feng, Hongtianzhi, HiEasy, Minking and Tsingvision are PRC companies. All of our officers and directors reside outside of the United States. All or substantially all of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our Company or such persons or to enforce against it or these persons the United States federal securities laws, or to enforce judgments obtained in United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY Seasonality affects our operating results. Our sales are affected by seasonality. Our revenues are usually higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year because fewer projects are undertaken during and around the Chinese spring festival. Our success relies on our managements ability to understand the highly evolving surveillance and security industry. The Chinese surveillance and security industry is nascent and rapidly evolving. Therefore, it is critical that our management is able to understand industry trends and make good strategic business decisions. If our management is unable to identify industry trends and act in response to such trends in a way that is beneficial to us, our business will suffer. If we are unable to respond to the rapid changes in our industry and changes in our customers requirements and preferences, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements, we could lose customers and market share. The electronic security systems industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Sudden changes in customer requirements and preferences, the frequent introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing products, services and systems obsolete. The emerging nature of products and services in the electronic security systems industry and their rapid evolution will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to: • enhance our existing products and services; • anticipate changing customer requirements by designing, developing, and launching new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers; and • respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development of additional products and services involves significant technological and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time. If we fail to introduce products with new technologies in a timely manner, or adapt our products to these new technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that even if we are able to introduce new products or adapt our products to new technologies that our products will gain acceptance among our customers. In addition, from time to time, we or our competitors may announce new products, product enhancements or technological innovations that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our existing products and that may cause customers to refrain from purchasing our existing products, resulting in inventory ob solescence. - -15- We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position of strong competition in the security and surveillance industry, and we expect this competition to continue to intensify. The Chinese security and surveillance industry is highly competitive. There are about 15,000 companies in China that engage in the business of manufacturing, designing and building surveillance and security products. In addition, since China joined the World Trade Organization, "WTO," we also face competition from international competitors. Some of our international competitors are larger than us and possess greater name recognition, assets, personnel, sales and financial resources. These entities may be able to respond more quickly to changing market conditions by developing new products and services that meet customer requirements or are otherwise superior to our products and services and may be able to more effectively market their products than we can because they have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. They may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their products. Increased competition could require us to reduce our prices, result in our receiving fewer customer orders, and result in our loss of market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to distinguish ourselves in a competitive market. To the extent that we are unable to successfully compete against existing and future competitors, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our business and reputation as a manufacturer of high quality security and surveillance products may be adversely affected by product defects or performance. We believe that we offer high quality products that are reliable and competitively priced. If our products do not perform to specifications, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. In addition, product defects could result in substantial product liability. We do not have product liability insurance. If we face significant liability claims, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our product offerings involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our profitability. Some of our products and services are designed for medium to large commercial, industrial and government facilities desiring to protect valuable assets and/or prevent intrusion into high security facilities in China. Given the nature of our products and the customers that purchase them, sales cycles can be lengthy as customers conduct intensive investigations and deliberate between competing technologies and providers. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with some of our products and services is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control. If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer. RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could impede the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and damage our business. We conduct substantially all of our operations and generate most of our revenue in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including: • the higher level of government involvement; • the early stage of development of the market-oriented sector of the economy; • the rapid growth rate; • the higher level of control over foreign exchange; and • the allocation of resources. As the PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy, the PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. While these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, they may also have a negative effect on us. - -16- Although the PRC government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways. Any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and the level of security and surveillance investments and expenditures in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us. We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in China. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference, but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, all of our executive officers and all but one of our directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese officers, directors and subsidiaries. The PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we conduct our business activities. The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively. Most of our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. Under PRC law, the Renminbi is currently convertible under the "current account," which includes dividends and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the "capital account," which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our PRC operating subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in Renminbi, any existing and fut ure restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange transactions by PRC operating subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC government authorities, including SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating subsidiaries borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, or their respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect our PRC operating subsidiaries ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing. - -17- Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us. In October 2005, SAFE issued a public notice, the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, or the SAFE Notice, which requires PRC residents to register with the competent local SAFE branch before using onshore assets or equity interests held by them to establish offshore special purpose companies, or SPVs, for the purpose of overseas equity financing. Under the SAFE Notice, such PRC residents must also file amendments to their registration in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, mergers and acquisitions, equity investment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in China to guarantee offshore obligations. Moreover, if the SPVs were established and owned the onshore assets or equity interest s before the implementation date of the SAFE Notice, a retroactive SAFE registration is required to have been completed before March 31, 2006. If any PRC resident stockholder of any SPV fails to make the required SAFE registration and amended registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV. Failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could also result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Because of uncertainty over how the SAFE Notice will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with the SAFE Notice by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by the SAFE Notice. We also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to com ply with the SAFE Notice, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. We may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations which became effective on September 8, 2006. On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, which became effective on September 8, 2006. This new regulation, among other things, governs the approval process by which a PRC company may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the new regulation will require the PRC parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with the new regulations is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to the new regulation, our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction. The new regulation allows PRC government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to the Ministry of Commerce and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report, an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement, all of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The regulations also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the PRC business or assets and in certain transaction structures, require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. The regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdb ack provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders economic interests. - -18- In addition to the above risks, in many instances, we will seek to structure transactions in a manner that avoids the need to make applications or a series of applications with Chinese regulatory authorities under these new M&A regulations. If we fail to effectively structure an acquisition in a manner that avoids the need for such applications or if the Chinese government interprets the requirements of the new M&A regulations in a manner different from our understanding of such regulations, then acquisitions that we have effected may be unwound or subject to rescission. Also, if the Chinese government determines that our structure of any of our acquisitions does not comply with these new regulations, then we may also be subject to fines and penalties. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities. The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the Renminbi and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in Renminbi and the net proceeds from this offering will be denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi will affect the relative purchasing power of these proceeds, our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars following this offering. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue after this offering that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars and earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future. Since July 2005, the Renminbi has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the Peoples Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the Renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future the PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currencies. Currently, some of our raw materials, components and major equipment are imported. In the event that the U.S. dollars appreciate against Renminbi, our costs will increase. If we cannot pass the resulting cost increases on to our customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer. In addition, since our sales to international customers are growing rapidly, we are increasingly subject to the risk of foreign currency depreciation. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Although publicly traded, the trading market in our common stock has been substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and this low trading volume may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our common stock started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CSR" on October 29, 2007. The trading market in our common stock has been substantially less liquid than the average trading market for companies quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2007, was approximately 286,818 shares. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to you. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us or changes in our management and, therefore depress the trading price of the common stock. Delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in its management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions: • deny holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, meaning that stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock will be able to elect all of our directors; • any stockholder wishing to properly bring a matter before a meeting of stockholders must comply with specified procedural and advance notice requirements; and • any vacancy on the board of directors, however the vacancy occurs, may only be filled by the directors. - -19- In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when you want to sell your holdings. The market price of our common stock is volatile, and this volatility may continue. For instance, between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, the closing bid price of our common stock, as reported on the markets on which our securities have traded, ranged between $11.75 and $33.60. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. These factors include: • our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors; • changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock; • speculation about our business in the press or the investment community; • significant developments relating to our relationships with our customers or suppliers; • stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in the security and surveillance parts or security and surveillance industries; • customer demand for our products; • investor perceptions of the security and surveillance parts and security and surveillance industries in general and our company in particular; • the operating and stock performance of comparable companies; • general economic conditions and trends; • major catastrophic events; • announcements by us or our competitors of new products, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; • changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles; • loss of external funding sources; • sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant stockholders; and • additions or departures of key personnel. Securities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our managements attention and resources. Moreover, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. For example, in late February 2007, the securities markets in the United States, China and other jurisdictions experienced the largest decline in share prices since September 2001. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in our company at a time when you want to sell your interest in us. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board deems relevant. RISKS RELATED TO OUR RECENT HIGH YIELD AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES Covenants in our debt instruments restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions. On February 16, 2007, we entered into a notes purchase agreement with Citadel Equity Fund Ltd., or "Citadel," as well as indentures and an investor rights agreement, relating to the purchase and sale of $60 million Guaranteed Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2012. On April 24, 2007, we entered into another notes purchase agreement with Citadel, as well as indentures and an amended and restated investor rights agreement, relating to the purchase and sale of $50 million Guaranteed Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2012. The two convertible notes are referred herein as the "Notes." - -20- The two indentures governing the Notes contain various covenants that may limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets, issue stock of subsidiaries, incur additional debts and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, if there is default, and we do not maintain certain financial covenants or we do not maintain borrowing availability in excess of certain pre-determined levels, we may be unable to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments (including paying cash dividends on our capital stock) or redeem or repurchase our capital stock. The indentures governing the Notes require us to maintain certain financial ratios and limit our ability to make capital expenditures. These covenants and ratios could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. Any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those imposed under the indenture governing the Notes. The Notes and their corresponding debt could have significant consequences to investors. For example, they could: • limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements; • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • require us to sell assets to reduce indebtedness or influence our decisions about whether to do so; • restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or pursuing business opportunities; • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; • limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds; and • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt. Under the indentures, if the Notes are not converted before its respective maturity, the Notes will be redeemed by us on the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes then outstanding plus an additional amount such that the total amount represents to the holders thereof a gross yield (including the paid or any accrued and unpaid interest) of 15.0% per annum, calculated on a quarterly compounded basis, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. If Citadel chooses not to convert the notes or are not forced to convert the notes under the mandatory conversion provisions as contained in the indentures, then we will incur significant debt obligations. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows, and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital, restructure our debt, or declare bankruptcy. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, we may be forced to sell at an unfavo rable price. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None.
