D. Risk Factors  Liquidity Risk. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate risk exposure arises from the fact that most of our debt is floating-rate (credit facilities, commercial paper and floating rate notes), with reference to Eonia, U.S. Libor and Euribor. To optimize the cost of our short-term and medium-term debt and reduce its volatility, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, and, if the case arises, interest rate options (purchases of caps, or combined purchases of caps and sales of floors) to alter the structure of our debt. (see Note D.20. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). As of December 31, 2008, 43% of our total debt (amounting to 5,938 million), was floating-rate and 57% was fixed-rate after taking account of interest rate derivatives. Our cash and cash equivalents (amounting to 4,226 million) are fully floating rate. As of December 31, 2008, the sensitivity of the total debt to interest rate fluctuations is detailed in the table below on a yearly basis: Change in 3-month Euribor Impact on pre-taxnet income (in  million) +100 bp (17) + 25 bp (4) - 25 bp 4 - 100 bp 17 Foreign Exchange Risk a. Operational Foreign Exchange Risk A substantial proportion of our net sales is generated in countries in which the euro, which is our reporting currency, is not the functional currency. In 2008, for example, 31.2% of our consolidated net sales were generated in the United States. Although we also incur expenses in those countries, the impact of those expenses is not enough wholly to offset the impact of exchange rates on net sales. Consequently, our operating income may be materially affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and other currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar. We operate a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to reduce the exposure of our operating income to exchange rate movements. This policy involves regular assessments of our worldwide foreign currency exposure, based on budget estimates of foreign-currency transactions to be carried out by the parent company and its subsidiaries. These transactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, co-marketing and co-promotion expenses, and royalties. To reduce the exposure of these transactions to exchange rate movements, we contract currency hedges using liquid financial instruments such as forward purchases and sales of currency as well as call and put options, and combinations of currency options (collars). The table below shows operational currency hedging derivatives in place as of December 31, 2008, with the notional amount translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate. See also Note D.20. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report for the accounting classification of these instruments as of December 31, 2008. 163 Table of Contents Operational foreign exchange derivatives as of December 31, 2008 (1): (in  million) Notionalamount Fairvalue Forward currency sales 3,305 219 of which: U.S. dollar 2,461 182 Japanese yen 191 (5 ) Russian rouble 134 15 Pound sterling 104 6 Saudi Arabian rial 58 5 Polish zloty 53 6 Forward currency purchases 601 (11 ) of which: Hungarian forint 175 (1 ) U.S dollar 140 3 Pound sterling 75 (6 ) Russian rouble 72 (6 ) Canadian dollar 51 (1 ) Put options purchased 24  Call options written 48 (7 ) Total 3,978 201 (1) As of December 31, 2007, the notional amount of forward currency sales was 2,205 million with a fair value of 30 million (including forward sales of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of 1,288 million with a fair value of 20 million). As of December 31, 2007, the notional amount of forward currency purchases was 464 million with an immaterial fair value (including forward sales of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of 48 million with a fair value of -1 million). In addition, as of December 31, 2007, the Group portfolio included purchased put options of a notional amount of 409 million with a fair value of 4 million, written call options of a notional amount of 741 million with a fair value of -1 million and written put options of a notional amount of 12 million with an immaterial fair value. As of December 31, 2008, none of these instruments had an expiry date after December 31, 2009. These positions hedge:  future foreign-currency cash flows arising after the balance sheet date in relation to transactions carried out during the year ended December 31, 2008 and recognized in the balance sheet at that date. Gains and losses on derivative instruments (forward contracts) have been and will continue to be calculated and recognized in parallel with the recognition of gains and losses on the hedged items. Due to this hedging relationship, the foreign exchange gain or loss on these items (derivative instruments and underlying assets) will be close to zero in 2009; and  forecast foreign-currency cash flows relating to commercial transactions to be carried out in 2009. These hedges (forward contracts and options) cover approximately 20% to 40% of the expected net cash flows for 2009 in currencies subject to budgetary hedging. The portfolio of derivatives relating to 2009 dollar U.S. denominated cash flows consists entirely of forward contracts and accounts for one-third of the expected cash flows. Given that these forward contracts were designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2008, the sensitivity of the foreign exchange gain or loss and the impact on equity related to these instruments would be as follows: Constant euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate over 2009 Foreign exchangegain/(loss) onU.S. dollar hedgingin  million Impact onequity Depreciation of 10% in the U.S. dollar (1 = $1.5309) 234.1 123.5 Exchange rate maintained at the December 31, 2008 rate (1 = $1.3917) 110.7  Appreciation of 10% in the U.S. dollar (1 = $1.2525) (40.2 ) (150.9 ) 164 Table of Contents b. Financial Foreign Exchange Risk Some of our financing activities, such as the cash pooling arrangements for foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone and our U.S. commercial paper issues (equivalent value: 0.7 billion as of December 31, 2008), expose certain entities, especially the sanofi-aventis parent company, to financial foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of changes in the value of loans and borrowings denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower). The net foreign exchange exposure for each currency and entity is hedged by firm financial instruments, usually currency swaps. (see Note D.20. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). The table below shows financial currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2008, calculated using exchange rates prevailing as of that date. Financial foreign exchange derivatives as of December 31, 2008 (1): (in  million) Notionalamount Fairvalue Expiry Forward currency purchases 9,210 (80 ) of which: U.S. dollar (*) 8,256 (66 ) 2009 Pound Sterling 235 (4 ) 2009 Canadian dollar 189 (13 ) 2009 Forward currency sales 1,954 (22 ) of which: U.S. dollar 1,043 (23 ) 2009 Japanese yen 665 (7 ) 2009 Hungarian forint 95 1 2009 Total 11,164 (102 ) (*) Includes 7,537 million used to hedge U.S. dollar intra-group deposits placed with the sanofi-aventis parent company. (1) As of December 31, 2007, the notional amount of forward currency purchases was 8,261 million with a fair value of -179 million (including forward purchases of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of 7,348 million with a fair value of -167 million). As of December 31, 2007, the notional amount of forward currency sales was 1,563 million with a fair value of 26 million (including forward sales of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of 936 million with a fair value of 20 million). These swaps generate a net foreign exchange financial result corresponding to the difference between the interest rates of the hedged currency and the euro. As regards the U.S. dollar, the interest rate spread related to forward currency purchases, positive in 2007, became negative in 2008, leading to an unfavorable variation of the financial foreign exchange profit and loss for 119 million. The change in value of short-term financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies due to movements in exchange rate is compensated by the change of intrinsic value of derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2008, none of the instruments had an expiry date after January 31, 2009. We may also hedge some future foreign-currency investment or divestment cash flows. c. Other Foreign Exchange Risks A significant proportion of our consolidated net assets is denominated in U.S. dollars. For a breakdown of net assets see Note D.35.2 to the consolidated financial statement. As a result, any fluctuation in the U.S. dollar against the euro affects shareholders equity as expressed in euros. As of December 31, 2008, we had no derivative instruments in place to limit the effect of such fluctuations. Counterparty Risk Our financing and investing operations as well as our currency and interest rate hedges, are contracted with leading banks. Concerning the investing operations and the derivative instruments, a limit is set for each financial institution, depending on its rating. The respect of the limits, computed on the basis of the notional amounts of the operations and level-headed by the remaining duration and the nature of the commitment, is subject to a daily follow-up. 165 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, the distribution of the exposure by rating and the percentage committed to the dominant counterparty were as follows: AA- ratingsand higher A+, A- and Aratings BBB ratingsand not rated % / rating of thedominantcounterparty as ofDecember 31,2008 Cash equivalents (excluding mutual funds) (1) 801 322  27% / AA- Notional amounts of currency hedges (2) 6,789 8,619  14% / A+ Notional amounts of interest rate hedges (2) 1,372 681  24% / AA- Credit facilities 6,275 6,236  11% / A+ (1) Cash equivalents include 2,601 million of mutual fund deposits classified as monétaires euros (Euro money-market) by the AMF. (2) The notional amounts are computed on the basis of the forward rates negotiated at the initiation date of the derivative instruments. Materialization of counterparty risk could impact the Groups liquidity in certain circumstances. Stock Market Risk It is our policy not to trade on the stock market for speculative purposes.

Controls and Procedures (a) Our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 20-F, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information relating to sanofi-aventis was timely made known to them by others within the Group. (b) Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with IFRS adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2008. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young Audit, independent registered public accounting firms, as stated in their report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, which is included herein. See paragraph (c) of the present Item 15, below. (c) See report of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young Audit, independent registered public accounting firms, included under Item 18. Financial Statements on page F-3. (d) There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 16. [Reserved] A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Our Board of Directors has determined that Gérard Van Kemmel and Klaus Pohle, independent directors serving on the Audit Committee, are financial experts. The Board of Directors determined that Mr. Van Kemmel 167 Table of Contents qualifies as an independent financial expert based on his experience as a partner at an international accounting firm. The Board of Directors held on May 2, 2008 also qualified Mr. Klaus Pohle as an independent financial expert taking into account his education and professional experience in financial matters, accountancy and internal control.

F. Change in Registrants Certifying Accountant N/A G. Corporate Governance Sanofi-aventis is incorporated under the laws of France, with securities publicly traded on markets in the United States (New York Stock Exchange) and France (Euronext Paris). Consequently, as described further in 168 Table of Contents our annual report, our corporate governance framework reflects the mandatory provisions of French corporate law, the securities laws and regulations of France and the United States and the rules of the aforementioned public markets. In addition, we generally follow the so-called AFEP-MEDEF corporate governance recommendations for French listed issuers. As a result, our corporate governance framework is similar in many respects to, and provides investor protections that are comparable to  or in some cases, more stringent than  the corresponding rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, there are important differences to keep in mind. In line with New York Stock Exchange rules applicable to domestic issuers, a majority of sanofi-aventis board members are independent. Sanofi-aventis evaluates the independence of members of our Board of Directors using the standards of the French AFEP-MEDEF corporate governance recommendations as the principal reference. We believe that AFEP-MEDEFs overarching criteria for independence  no relationship of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its group or the management of either that is such as to color a Board members judgment  are on the whole consistent with the goals of the New York Stock Exchanges rules although the specific tests proposed under the two standards may vary on some points. Additionally, we have complied with the audit committee independence and other requirements of the Rule 10A-3 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Under French law, the committees of our Board of Directors are advisory only, and where the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual would vest certain decision-making powers with specific committees by delegation (e.g., nominating or audit committees), our Board of Directors remains by law the only competent body to take such decisions, albeit taking into account the recommendation of the relevant committees. Additionally, under French corporate law, it is the shareholder meeting of sanofi-aventis that is competent to appoint our auditors upon the proposal of our Board of Directors, although our internal rules provide that the Board of Directors will make its proposal on the basis of the recommendation of our Audit Committee. We believe that this requirement of French law, together with the additional legal requirement that two sets of statutory auditors be appointed, share the New York Stock Exchanges underlying goal of ensuring that the audit of our accounts be conducted by auditors independent from company management. In addition to the oversight role of our Compensation Committee for questions of management compensation including by way of equity, under French law any option plans or other share capital increases, whether for the benefit of top management or employees, may only be adopted by management pursuant to and within the limits of a shareholder resolution approving the related capital increase and delegating to the board the authority to implement such operations. As described above, a number of issues, which could be resolved directly by a board or its committees in the United States, require the additional protection of direct shareholder consultation in France. On the other hand, there is not a tradition of non-executive Board of Director sessions. Our audit committee is entirely composed of independent directors as that term is defined in Rule 10A-3 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The composition of our Compensation Committee, and Appointments and Governance Committee includes directors who are also officers of our principal shareholders. As a foreign private issuer under the U.S. securities laws, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer issue the certifications required by §302 and §906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 on an annual basis (with the filing of our annual report on U.S. Form 20-F) rather than on a quarterly basis as would be the case of a U.S. corporation filing quarterly reports on U.S. Form 10-Q. French corporate law provides that the Board of Directors must vote to approve a broadly defined range of transactions that could potentially create conflicts of interest between sanofi-aventis on the one hand and its directors and officers on the other hand. This legal safeguard operates in place of certain provisions of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. 169 Table of Contents PART III Item 17. Financial Statements See Item 18. Item 18.
