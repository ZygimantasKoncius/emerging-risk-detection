Risk Factors We wish to caution readers that the following important factors, and those important factors described in other reports submitted to, or filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission, among other factors, could affect our actual results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf and that such factors may adversely affect our business and financial status and therefore the value of your investment: Risks Relating to Our Business Since we are dependent on the highly cyclical semiconductor and microelectronics industries, which have experienced significant and sometimes prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity, our revenues, earnings and margins may fluctuate significantly. The semiconductor market and microelectronics industries have historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. Our semiconductor foundry business is affected by market conditions in such highly cyclical semiconductor and microelectronics industries. Most of our customers operate in these industries. Variations in order levels from our customers result in volatility in our revenues and earnings. From time to time, the semiconductor and microelectronics industries have experienced significant, and sometimes prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because our business is, and will continue to be, dependent on the requirements of semiconductor and microelectronics companies for our services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general semiconductor and microelectronics industries lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services worldwide, including our services. If we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, our revenues, margin and earnings will suffer during downturns and periods of overcapacity. -5- Table of Contents Decreases in demand and average selling prices for products that contain semiconductors may adversely affect demand for our products and may result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings. A vast majority of our sales revenue is derived from customers who use our services in personal computers, communication devices and consumer electronics products. Any significant decrease in the demand for the products may decrease the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including our services and may adversely affect our revenues. In addition, the historical and current trend of declining average selling prices of end use applications places pressure on the prices of the components that go into these end use applications. If the average selling prices of end use applications continue decreasing, the pricing pressure on components produced by us may lead to a reduction of our revenue. If we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive foundry segment of the semiconductor industry, we may lose customers and our profit margin and earnings may decrease. The markets for our foundry services are highly competitive both in Taiwan and internationally. We compete with other dedicated foundry service providers, as well as integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced technologies and greater financial and other resources than us. Our competition may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or more technology nodes. Competitive activities may cause us to lose customers or to decrease our average selling prices or both. If we are unable to remain a technological leader in the semiconductor industry, we may become less competitive. The semiconductor industry and the technologies used in it are constantly changing. If we do not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies or our competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to more advanced technologies, we may not be able to provide advanced foundry services on competitive terms. Although we have concentrated on maintaining a competitive edge in research and development, if we fail to achieve advances in technology or processes, or to obtain access to advanced technologies or processes developed by others, we may become less competitive. If we are unable to manage our expansion and the modification of our production facilities effectively, our growth prospects may be limited. We have been ramping up the production of our 300mm wafer fabs in the Hsinchu Science Park and Tainan Science Park, respectively, since 2004. In 2007, the capacity of our 300mm wafer fabs increased from 93,700 wafer per month in 2006 to 130,700 wafer per month in 2007. Expansion and modification of our production facilities will, among other factors, increase our costs. For example, we will need to purchase additional equipment, train personnel to operate the new equipment or hire additional personnel. If we do not increase our net sales accordingly in order to offset these higher costs, our financial performance may be adversely affected. We may not be able to implement our planned growth or development if we are unable to accurately forecast and sufficiently meet our future capital requirements. Capital requirements are difficult to plan in the highly dynamic, cyclical and rapidly changing semiconductor industry. We will continue to need significant capital to fund our operations and growth. Although we currently have adequate financial resources and excellent relations with financial institutions who are willing to consider extending credit to us if needed on market terms, our continued ability to obtain sufficient external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:  our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flow;  general market conditions for financing activities by semiconductor companies; and  social, economic, financial, political and other conditions in Taiwan and elsewhere. -6- Table of Contents Sufficient external financing may not be available to us on a timely basis, on general market terms, or at all. As a result, we may be forced to curtail our expansion and modification plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until we obtain such financing. We may not be able to implement our planned growth or maintain our leading position if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and skilled technical and service personnel. We depend on the continued services and contributions of our executive officers and skilled technical and other personnel. Our business could suffer if we lose, for whatever reasons, the services and contributions of some of these personnel and we cannot adequately replace them. We may be required to increase the number of employees in connection with any business expansion, and since there is intense competition for the recruitment of these personnel, we cannot ensure that we will be able to fulfill our personnel requirements in a timely manner. We may be unable to obtain in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the equipment necessary for us to remain competitive. Our operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on our ability to obtain a significant amount of equipment and related services from a limited number of suppliers in a market that is characterized, from time to time, by intense demand, limited supply and long delivery cycles. During such times, supplier-specific or industry-wide lead times for delivery can be as long as four to ten months or more. To better manage potential shortage, we have implemented various business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to shorten the procurement lead time. We also provide our projected demand for various items to many of our equipment suppliers to help them plan their production in advance. If we are unable to obtain equipment in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost, we may be unable to fulfill our customers orders, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our revenue and profitability may decline if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner and at reasonable prices. Our production operations require that we obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis. Shortages in the supply of some materials experienced by specific vendors or by the semiconductor industry generally have in the past resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Also, since we procure some of our raw materials from sole-source suppliers, there is a risk that our need for such raw materials may not be timely met. Our revenue and earnings could decline if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials that we cannot pass on to our customers. If the Ministry of Economic Affairs uses a substantial portion of our production capacity, we will not be able to service our other customers. According to our agreement with the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan, or ITRI, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the R.O.C., or an entity designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has an option to purchase up to 35% of certain of our capacity, if our outstanding commitments to our customers are not prejudiced. Although the Ministry of Economic Affairs has never exercised this option, if this option is exercised to any significant degree during tight market conditions, we may not be able to provide services to all of our other customers unless we are able to increase our capacity accordingly or outsource such increased demand and in a timely manner. Any inability to obtain, preserve and defend our technologies and intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position. Our ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth will depend in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. While we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our proprietary technology, trade secrets, software or know-how. Also, we cannot assure you that, as our business or business models expand into new areas, we will be able to develop independently the technology, trade secrets, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others. To the extent that we rely on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims. -7- Table of Contents We have received, from time-to-time, communications from third parties asserting that our technologies, manufacturing processes, the design of the integrated circuits made by us or the use by our customers of semiconductors made by us may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. And, because of the nature of the industry, we may continue to receive such communications in the future. In some instances, these disputes have resulted in litigation. If we fail to obtain or maintain certain government, technology or intellectual property licenses and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could prevent us from manufacturing or selling particular products or applying particular technologies, which could reduce our opportunities to generate revenues. See Item 8. Financial Information  Legal Proceedings for a further discussion. We are subject to the risk of loss due to explosion and fire because some of the materials we use in our manufacturing processes are highly combustible. We and many of our suppliers use highly combustible and toxic materials in manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to the risk of loss arising from explosion, fire, or environmental excursions which cannot be completely eliminated. Although we maintain many overlapping risk prevention and protection systems, as well as comprehensive fire and casualty insurance, including insurance for loss of property and loss of profit resulting from business interruption, our risk management and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. If any of our fabs were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire, or environmental excursions, it could reduce our manufacturing capacity and may cause us to lose important customers, thereby having a potentially material adverse impact on our financial performance. Any impairment charges may have a material adverse effect on our net income. Under R.O.C. GAAP and U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate our long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. If certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge. We are also required under R.O.C. GAAP and U.S. GAAP to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis or whenever a triggering event or an indication of impairment occurs. We currently are not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on our net income. The determination of an impairment charge at any given time is based significantly on our expected results of operations over a number of years subsequent to that time. As a result, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when our operating results are otherwise already depressed. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Critical Accounting Policies for a discussion of our estimates made for determining an impairment charge. The loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. While we generate revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% and 51% of our net sales in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and our largest customer accounted for approximately 10% and 11% of our net sales in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of our top customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. -8- Table of Contents Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the market price of our common shares and ADSs. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and results of operations could be harmed. We are required to comply with various R.O.C. and U.S. laws and regulations on internal controls. For example, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, beginning with the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, we are required to furnish a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting, including managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, R.O.C. law requires us to establish internal control systems that would reasonably ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We are also required under R.O.C. law to file an internal control declaration within four months of the end of each fiscal year. Internal controls may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and ADSs. Our global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal, political, economic or other conditions or developments in various jurisdictions, including in particular the Republic of China (R.O.C.), which could negatively affect our business and financial status and therefore the market value of your investment. Our principal executive officers and our principal production facilities are located in the R.O.C. and a substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from our operations in the R.O.C. In addition, we have operations worldwide and a significant percentage of our revenue come from sales to locations outside the R.O.C. Operating in the R.O.C. and overseas exposes us to changes in policies and laws, as well as the general political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks, in the various countries in which we operate, which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations as well as the market price and the liquidity of our ADSs and common shares. For example, even though the R.O.C. and the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) have co-existed for the past 59 years and significant economic and cultural relations have been established during that time, the financial markets have viewed certain past developments in relations between the two sides as occasions to depress general market prices of the securities of Taiwanese companies, including our own. In addition, the R.O.C. government currently restricts transfer by Taiwanese companies of certain technologies to and certain types of investments by Taiwanese companies in Mainland China. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by natural disasters or interruptions in the supply of utilities (such as water or electricity) in the locations in which we, our customers or suppliers operate. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural disasters such as severe weather and earthquakes as well as interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities (such as water and electricity) that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, most of our production facilities, as well as many of our suppliers and customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in Taiwan, which is susceptible to earthquakes, typhoons, and has experienced droughts from time to time. In addition, we have sometimes suffered power outages caused by our major electricity supplier, the Taiwan Power Company, or other power consumers on the same power supply line, which have caused interruptions in our production schedule. A natural disaster or interruptions in the supply of utilities that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. -9- Table of Contents Fluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses. Over half of our capital expenditures and manufacturing costs are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. More than 90% of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and currencies other than NT dollars. Therefore, any significant fluctuation to our disadvantage in such exchange rate may have an adverse effect on our financial condition. For example, during the period from January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2008, the U.S. dollar has depreciated 6.4% against the NT dollar, which may have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of our common shares and the market price of the ADSs and of any cash dividends paid in NT dollars on our common shares represented by ADSs. Please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Inflation and Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a further discussion on the possible impact of other market factors on our results of operations. Risks Relating to Ownership of ADSs Your voting rights as a holder of ADSs will be limited. Holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) evidencing ADSs may exercise voting rights with respect to the common shares represented by these ADSs only in accordance with the provisions of our ADS deposit agreement. The deposit agreement provides that, upon receipt of notice of any meeting of holders of our common shares, the depositary bank will, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the holders (i) the notice of the meeting sent by us, (ii) voting instruction forms and (iii) a statement as to the manner in which instructions may be given by the holders. ADS holders will not generally be able to exercise the voting rights attaching to the deposited securities on an individual basis. According to the R.O.C. Company Law, the voting rights attaching to the deposited securities must be exercised as to all matters subject to a vote of shareholders collectively in the same manner, except in the case of an election of directors. Election of directors is by means of cumulative voting. See Item 10. Additional Information  Voting of Deposited Securities for a more detailed discussion of the manner in which a holder of ADSs can exercise its voting rights. You may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings. We may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under our ADS deposit agreement, the depositary bank will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt from registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. Although we may be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions for rights offerings by certain foreign companies, we can give no assurance that we can establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have such a registration statement declared effective. In addition, if the depositary bank is unable to obtain the requisite approval from the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) for the conversion of the subscription payments into NT dollars or if the depositary determines that it is unlikely to obtain this approval, we may decide with the depositary bank not to make the rights available to holders of ADSs. See Item 10. Additional Information  Foreign Investment in the R.O.C. and Item 10. Additional Information  Exchange Controls in the R.O.C.. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result. If the depositary bank is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights. -10- Table of Contents The value of your investment may be reduced by possible future sales of common shares or ADSs by us or our shareholders. One or more of our existing shareholders may, from time to time, dispose of significant numbers of our common shares or ADSs. For example, the National Development Fund, one of our major shareholders, has sold our shares in the form of ADSs in several transactions since 1997. In May 2005, Philips, another major shareholder of ours, reiterated its intention, first announced in October 2003, to gradually and orderly reduce its equity interest in us. On March 9, 2007, Philips and TSMC jointly announced a multi-phase plan to facilitate an orderly exit by Philips from its current shareholding in us. Specifically, according to the announced plan, Philips intends to divest its current shareholding in us through one or more block trades on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, a public offering of our common shares in the form of ADSs, and through participation in the share buy-backs conducted by us during a period beginning in 2007 and ending in 2010.  The plans initial step occurred on March 12, 2007, when Philips sold approximately US$1.75 billion worth of our common shares over the Taiwan Stock Exchange through block trades to a few institutional investors in Taiwan.  The plans second step was a sale by Philips in a public offering registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of approximately US$2.56 billion worth of our common shares in the form of ADSs on May 18, 2007. It is the intention of TSMC and Philips that no further ADS offerings will be conducted in respect of Philips shareholding in TSMC.  For the third step of the plan, we conducted a share repurchase program from November 14, 2007 to December 31, 2007, in the amount of approximately US$1.5 billion, and subsequently canceled 800 million common shares that had been repurchased. During the same period, Philips also disposed 800 million of our common shares by selling them in the open market. After the completion of this third step, Philips held approximately 5.1% of our total outstanding common shares as of February 29, 2008.  Lastly, the plans fourth step calls for us to conduct, subject to maintaining our current annual cash dividend per share, additional share repurchase and cancellation programs between 2008 and 2010. Philips has informed us that it intends to tender its remaining equity interest in us at such time. Philips may also consider selling its remaining equity interest in us to specified long-term investors mutually agreeable to Philips and us. While we hope to continue to work with Philips to implement the above plan to facilitate the contemplated disposals by Philips of its equity interests in us in a way that, to the extent possible, minimizes any adverse impact on us and the market price of our ADSs and common shares, there is no written agreement between us and Philips in respect of the above plan and no assurances can be given as to the timing and potential impact of the implementation of such plan or any other method of disposal by Philips. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of ADSs or common shares, or the availability of ADSs or common shares for future sale, will have on the market price of ADSs or common shares prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of ADSs or common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the prevailing market price of our ADSs or common shares. The market value of our shares may fluctuate due to the volatility of, and government intervention in, the R.O.C. securities market. Because the Taiwan Stock Exchange experiences from time to time substantial fluctuations in the prices and volumes of sales of listed securities, there are currently limits on the range of daily price movements on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In response to past declines and volatility in the securities markets in Taiwan, and in line with similar activities by other countries in Asia, the government of the R.O.C. formed the Stabilization Fund, which has purchased and may from time to time purchase shares of Taiwan companies to support these markets. In addition, other funds associated with the R.O.C. government have in the past purchased, and may from time to time purchase, shares of Taiwan companies on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or other markets. In the future, market activity by government entities, or the perception that such activity is taking place, may take place or has ceased, may cause fluctuations in the market prices of our ADSs and common shares. -11- Table of Contents
