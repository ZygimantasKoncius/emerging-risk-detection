Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and under the caption title "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Item 7. As of February 2, 2008 we did not have any credit facilities or lines of credit and we are not the guarantor of any other material third-party obligations. As of February 2, 2008, we did not have any standby letters of credit nor any standby repurchase obligations. If our revenues and cash flows during fiscal 2009 are lower than fiscal 2008, we may not have cash available to continue to pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock or to explore or consummate the acquisition of other brands. If our revenues and cash flows during fiscal 2009 are materially lower than fiscal 2008, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities. However, any reduction of revenues would be partially offset by reductions in the amounts we would be required to pay under the management agreement, employee bonuses, and other expenses. We believe that we will have sufficient cash generated from our business activities to support our operations for the next twelve months. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation, traditionally, has not had a significant effect on our operations. Since most of our future revenues are based upon a percentage of sales of the licensed products by our licensees, we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on future operations. 25 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect SFAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, The Fair Value Option for financial assets and financial liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB statement No. 115 ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value SFAS 159 permits entities to make an irrevocable election to measure certain financial instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be included in net earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 will be effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal year 2008 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ("SFAS 141(R)"), which improves the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. SFAS 141(R) requires acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition. This statement is applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Unaudited Quarterly Results The following table summarizes certain unaudited financial information by quarter for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007: Fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 May 5, 2007 August 4, 2007 November 3, 2007 February 2, 2008 Net revenues $ 12,040,000 $ 11,901,000 $ 8,942,000 $ 8,735,000 Income before income taxes 8,544,000 7,952,000 5,346,000 5,457,000 Net income 5,014,000 4,908,000 3,698,000 2,809,000 Net income per sharebasic 0.57 0.55 0.41 0.32 Net income per sharediluted 0.56 0.55 0.41 0.31 Fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 April 29, 2006 July 29, 2006 October 28, 2006 February 3, 2007 Net revenues $ 13,228,000 $ 12,409,000 $ 8,801,000 $ 42,189,000 Income before income taxes 9,819,000 8,372,000 5,520,000 34,318,000 Net income 5,914,000 4,942,000 3,281,000 20,653,000 Net income per sharebasic 0.67 0.56 0.37 2.34 Net income per sharediluted 0.67 0.56 0.37 2.33 26 During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended February 3, 2007, we terminated one material licensing agreement (our Finder's Agreement with Mossimo Inc.) in exchange for a one-time payment of $33.0 million. Seasonality Given our contractual royalty rate reductions with our licensees, as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved by our licensees in any given fiscal year, historically our first quarter has been our largest quarter; our second quarter has been our next largest quarter, and our third and fourth quarters have been our smallest quarters. Item 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES OF MARKET RISK Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest: From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest-bearing temporary investments of high-quality issuers. Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us. Previously, our only long-term debt obligations were the Secured Notes, which were zero-coupon secured notes yielding interest of 7.0% interest per annum, and which were retired on February 20, 2004. We currently do not have any long-term debt obligations. Foreign Currency: We conduct business in various parts of the world. We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business. For fiscal 2008, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 52% of our consolidated revenues. For fiscal 2008, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the US dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where we operate would have affected our revenues by approximately $2.2 million, which represents 5.2% of the total revenues reported for fiscal 2008. Such change is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flow. Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars. As a consequence, the past weakening of the U.S. dollar has benefited us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees such as Tesco and Comercial Mexicana increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies (the British Pound or Euro, the Peso). Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar has not benefited us. For example, the royalty revenues from Tesco (United Kingdom) during fiscal 2008 reflect a favorable 6.2% ($758,000) change in the revenue-weighted-average exchange rate as compared to the revenue-weighted-average exchange rate used in the comparable period in fiscal 2007. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the exchange rate reflected a favorable 8.4% change in the average exchange rate as compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2007; during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 the exchange rate reflected a favorable 6.2% change in the average exchange ratio as compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2007; during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 the exchange rate reflected a favorable 8.6% change in the average exchange ratio as compared to the comparable period last year; and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the exchange rate reflected a favorable 1.8% change in the average exchange ratio as compared to the comparable period last year. In the future, should the dollar strengthen against such foreign currencies, the total royalty revenues reported by us from such licensees would reflect such changes in the currency exchange rates. Accordingly, a strengthening dollar, compared to current exchange rates, would likely result in lower reported royalty revenues than otherwise would be reported as a result of such unfavorable exchange rate movements. 27 Item 8.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. (the Company) as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended February 2, 2008. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008, based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also include performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cherokee Inc., as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended February 2, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, Cherokee Inc., maintained in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008, based on the COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. 29 As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted a new principle of accounting for share-based payments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB No. 109." /s/ MOSS ADAMS LLP Los Angeles, California April 15, 2008 30 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cherokee Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholder's equity and cash flows for the year ended January 28, 2006 present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended January 28, 2006 of Cherokee Inc. and its subsidiaries, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Los Angeles, California April 11, 2006 31 CHEROKEE INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Business Cherokee Inc. (which may be referred to as we, us, or our) is in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee, Sideout and Carole Little brands and related trademarks and other brands it owns or represents. We are one of the leading licensors of brand names and trademarks for apparel, footwear and accessories in the United States. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, SPELL C. LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Company Year End Our fiscal year comprises a 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31. Fiscal 2007 represents a 53 week period, and Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2006 represent 52 week periods. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased and money market funds with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition Revenues from royalty and finders agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees. Revenues are not recognized unless collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain of our royalty agreements are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of sales are achieved by our licensees. The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the year. Revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data as required sales thresholds are exceeded. Our royalty receivables are generally collected in the month following the end of a quarter. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the resulting gains or losses are included in current operations. Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Computers and related equipment are depreciated over two years. Building improvements are depreciated over five years, or in some cases, longer, depending upon the 36 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) specific improvements and the estimated life of the lease. Depreciation expense was $75,000, $123,000 and $83,000 for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively. Trademarks We hold various trademarks including Cherokee®, Sideout®, Sideout Sport®, Carole Little®, CL II®, Saint Tropez-West®, Chorus Line, All That Jazz®, Molly Malloy® and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods. These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in a number of other countries. We also hold trademark applications for Cherokee, Sideout, Sideout Sport, Carole Little, CLII, Chorus Line, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz, and Molly Malloy and others in numerous countries. We intend to renew these registrations as appropriate prior to expiration. We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of our trademarks, and we rely primarily upon a combination of trademark, copyright, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally. Trademark registrations, renewal fees and acquired trademarks (including contingent payments) are stated at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful life, which is the shorter of the period the assets are expected to be used, or the life of the trademark registration, of ten to fifteen years. We only capitalize renewal fees that extend the life of the trademark registration in a particular territory. Long-Lived Assets The realizability of long-lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount. Long-lived assets that will no longer be used in business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for the Company. Periodically, long lived assets that will continue to be used by the Company need to be evaluated for recoverability. Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections. The analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment. In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value. Income Taxes Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB interpretation (FIN) No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under FIN 48, tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 37 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 15, 2006. The cumulative effects of adopting FIN 48 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption (see Note 4). Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. We limit our credit risk with respect to cash by maintaining cash balances with quality financial institutions. At fiscal year end February 2, 2008 ("fiscal 2008") and February 3, 2007 ("fiscal 2007"), our cash and cash equivalents exceeded FDIC limits. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are minimal due to the limited amount of open receivables and due to the nature of our licensing royalty revenue program. Generally, we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. One customer, Target Corporation ("Target"), accounted for approximately 37% and 40%, respectively, of our trade receivables at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 and approximately 42%, 24%, and 47%, respectively, of our revenues during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 ("fiscal 2006"). Another customer, Great Britain's Tesco Stores Limited ("Tesco"), accounted for approximately 45% and 37%, respectively, of our trade receivables at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 and approximately 41%, 18%, and 25%, respectively, of our revenues during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006. Our international revenues represent approximately 52%, 24%, and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006. Significant Contracts In 1997, we entered into an agreement with Target that grants Target the exclusive right in the United States to use the Cherokee trademarks in certain categories of merchandise. The terms of our relationship with Target are set forth in an amended licensing agreement between Cherokee and Target entered into on November 12, 1997. On January 10, 2008, we announced that we entered into a restated license agreement with Target, which became effective on February 1, 2008 (the "Restated Target Agreement"). The Restated Target Agreement grants Target the exclusive right in the United States to use the Cherokee trademarks in various specified categories of merchandise. The term of the Restated Target Agreement continues through January 31, 2012. However, the Restated Target Agreement provides that if Target remains current in its payments of the minimum guaranteed royalty of $9.0 million for the preceding fiscal year, then the term of the agreement will continue to automatically renew for successive fiscal year terms provided that Target does not give notice of its intention to terminate the agreement during February of the calendar year prior to termination. Under the Restated Target Agreement, Target has agreed to pay royalties based on a percentage of Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year ended January 31st, which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise. On August 1, 2001, we entered into an exclusive international retail direct licensing agreement for the Cherokee brand with Tesco. Tesco was granted the exclusive right to manufacture, promote, sell and distribute a wide range of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United Kingdom and Ireland and is obligated to pay us a royalty based upon a percentage of its net sales of Cherokee branded products in those countries. In January 2004, we granted Tesco the rights to certain other countries including South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Slovakia, and Hungary, and in 2005, we added the rights to Poland and the Czech Republic. In March 2006, Tesco began to sell Cherokee branded products in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia, and, in July 2006, Tesco began to sell Cherokee branded products in Hungary. In addition, in February 2007 we added the territory of China to the Tesco agreement, and the territories of South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand were previously added to the 38 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Tesco agreement. The term of the Tesco agreement expires on January 31, 2011. Royalty revenues from Tesco totaled $17.1 million in fiscal 2008, $13.9 million in fiscal 2007, and $10.6 million in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 our only United States retail direct licensing contract for the Sideout brand was with Mervyn's, which is on a non-exclusive basis. The term of our agreement with Mervyn's continues until January 31, 2010. Under the Mervyn's agreement, Mervyn's will pay a royalty each fiscal year based on a percentage of Mervyn's net sales of Sideout branded merchandise during each fiscal year, subject to a guaranteed minimum royalty of $688,000. During fiscal 2008, royalty revenues from Mervyn's retail sales of Sideout branded products totaled $0.9 million, as compared to $1.6 million during fiscal 2007, and $2.3 million in fiscal 2006. On August 22, 1997, we entered into an exclusive international retail direct licensing agreement with Zellers Inc., a Canadian retailer that is a division of Hudson's Bay Company. Zellers was granted the exclusive right in Canada to use the Cherokee brand and related trademarks in connection with a broad range of categories of merchandise. In fiscal 2007 Zellers renewed their agreement for an additional five year period, beginning February 1, 2007 and continuing through January 31, 2012, and certain of the terms were changed to Canadian Dollars. Under the terms of the renewed agreement, Zellers agreed to pay us a minimum guaranteed royalty of CDN $1.5 million per year (equivalent to about US$1.5 million at February 2, 2008) over the new five-year term. Zellers has the option to renew this agreement for two additional five year terms beyond the most recent renewal. During fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 the royalty revenues from Zellers totaled $2.9 million, $3.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and satisfied the annual minimum guarantee. During fiscal 2001, we assisted Mossimo Inc. in locating Target as a licensee of the Mossimo brand and entered into a finder's agreement with Mossimo dated March 27, 2000 which provided that we received a fixed percentage of all monies paid to Mossimo by Target (the "Finder's Agreement"). Under the Mossimo agreement with Target, Target was obligated to pay Mossimo a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of Mossimo branded products, subject to a guaranteed minimum royalty. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we terminated the Finder's Agreement in return for a payment of $33.0 million, and accordingly will not be reporting any future royalties from Mossimo. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The amount recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements approximates fair value as defined in SFAS No. 107 "Disclosures about the Fair Value of Financial Instruments." Stock-Based Compensation We currently maintain three equity-based compensation plans: (i) the Cherokee 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1995 Plan"); (ii) the 2003 Incentive Award Plan (the "2003 Plan"); and (iii) the 2006 Incentive Award Plan (the "2006 Plan"). Each of these stock option award plans provide for the issuance of equity-based awards to officers and other employees and directors, and they have previously been approved by our stockholders. Stock options issued to employees are granted at the market price on the date of grant, generally vest over a three-year period, and generally expire seven to ten years from the date of grant. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options. On January 29, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," ("SFAS 123(R)"), using the modified prospective method, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors for employee stock options based on estimated fair values. Prior to 39 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) January 28, 2006, the Company accounted for its fixed stock options using the intrinsic value method, as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). Accordingly, no stock option expense was recorded in periods prior to January 28, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 123(R), applying the modified prospective method, requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations. Under the modified prospective method, we are required to recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet fully vested as of January 28, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions under the original SFAS 123. Accordingly, prior years' amounts have not been restated. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures over the awards service period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) for the year ended February 2, 2008 was $776,000 and for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 was $705,000. Marketing and Advertising Generally, our retail direct licensees fund their own advertising programs. Our own advertising and promotional costs are immaterial and are expensed as incurred. We do provide marketing expense money to certain large licensees to help them build the Cherokee brand in their respective territories. Total marketing expenses paid during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1.2 million, $1.1 million and $857,000, respectively. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is similar to the computation for basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. See Note 5 for details of the computation. Comprehensive Income SFAS 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income" establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources. For fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, we had no other comprehensive income components and accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income. Segment Reporting The provisions of SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" require public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. We identify reportable segments based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility. We operate in a single business segment, the marketing and licensing of brand names and trademarks for apparel, footwear and accessories. Our marketing and licensing activities extend to both brands which it owns and to brands owned by others. Our operating activities relating to both owned 40 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) and represented brands are identical and are performed by a single group of marketing professionals located in a single geographic location. While our principal operations are in the United States, we also derive royalty revenues from some of our key licensee's that are located in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. Revenues by geographic area consisted of the following: Year Ended February 2, 2008 Year Ended February 3, 2007 Year Ended January 28, 2006 (in thousands) North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico) $ 23,898 $ 62,123 $ 31,429 Europe 17,077 14,417 11,250 South Africa and Other 645 87 53 Total $ 41,620 $ 76,627 $ 42,732 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect SFAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, The Fair Value Option for financial assets and financial liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB statement No. 115 ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value SFAS 159 permits entities to make an irrevocable election to measure certain financial instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be included in net earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 will be effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal year 2008 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ("SFAS 141(R)"), which improves the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. SFAS 141(R) requires acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition. This statement is applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. 3. Trademarks Trademarks consist of the following: February 2, 2008 February 3, 2007 Trademarks $ 17,750,000 $ 13,615,000 Accumulated amortization (7,673,000 ) (6,383,000 ) Total $ 10,077,000 $ 7,232,000 41 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Amortization expense of trademarks was $1.3 million, $1.2 million, and $1.1 million for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively. Expected amortization of trademarks for the years ending January 31, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and for 2013 and thereafter is $1.3 million, $1.3 million, $1.3 million, $1.3 million, $1.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively. During fiscal 2008 the Company acquired the 45% share of the Carole Little royalties from Studio CL for a total of $4.0 million, comprised of $1.25 million in cash and $2.75 million in shares of Cherokee common stock. We did not acquire any trademarks during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. Trademark registration and renewal fees, excluding the $4.0 million acquisition costs associated with Carole Little, which were capitalized during fiscal 2008 totaled $135,000, comprised of registration and renewal fees of $80,000 for Cherokee, $21,000 for Sideout, and $34,000 for the brands (Carole Little, others) purchased in fiscal 2003. In comparison, during fiscal 2007 we capitalized registration and renewal fees totaling $259,000, comprised of registration and renewal fees of $189,000 for Cherokee, $21,000 for Sideout, and $49,000 for the brands (Carole Little, others) purchased in fiscal 2003. 4. Income Taxes The income tax provision as shown in the statements of operations includes the following: Year Ended February 2, 2008 Year Ended February 3, 2007 Year Ended January 28, 2006 Current: Federal $ 7,763,000 $ 16,644,000 $ 7,230,000 State 1,806,000 4,332,000 2,178,000 Foreign 604,000 2,930,000 2,475,000 10,173,000 23,906,000 11,883,000 Deferred: Federal 763,000 (638,000 ) 204,000 State (66,000 ) (29,000 ) (14,000 ) 697,000 (667,000 ) 190,000 $ 10,870,000 $ 23,239,000 $ 12,073,000 A reconciliation of the actual income tax rates to the federal statutory rate follows: Year Ended February 2, 2008 Year Ended February 3, 2007 Year Ended January 28, 2006 Tax expense at U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax benefit, net of federal income tax 4.8 4.8 4.8 Other  0.2  Tax provision 39.8 % 40.0 % 39.8 % 42 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of deferred income tax assets is as follows: February 2, 2008 February 3, 2007 Current Non-Current Current Non-Current Deferred tax assets: Depreciation and Amortization $  115,000 $  24,000 Tax effect of NOL carryovers 273,000 547,000 273,000 820,000 State income taxes 737,000  1,520,000 (14,000 ) Compensation  433,000  179,000 Total deferred tax assets $ 1,010,000 1,095,000 $ 1,793,000 1,009,000 Foreign taxes include withholding required on royalty payments from foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets primarily relate to state tax benefits and the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards. We believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based upon expected future income. In 1994, we filed a prepackaged plan of reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the plan, an ownership change occurred and the annual limitation of pre-reorganization net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") and built-in losses (i.e. the tax bases of assets exceeded their fair market value at the date of the ownership change) has been substantially limited under IRC Section 382. The annual limitation amount, computed pursuant to IRC Section 382(1)(6), is approximately $780,000. Any unused IRC Section 382 annual loss limitation amount may be carried forward to the following year. Those unused limitation losses are then added to the current IRC Section 382 annual limitation amount. As of February 2, 2008, we estimate that we have $2.3 million of federal Section 382 NOLs available that begin to expire in 2008. Management expects to fully utilize these NOLs prior to expiration. Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted the provision of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 has resulted in a decrease to our retained earnings of approximately $0.4 million as of February 4, 2007. As of February 2, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $1.8 million, of which approximately $0.9 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Amount (in Millions) Balance at February 4, 2007 $ 10.2 Additions for tax positions related to current year  Additions/reductions for tax positions taken in prior years .4 Reductions for tax positions as a result of:  Settlements (8.8 ) Lapse of Limitations  Balance at February 2, 2008 $ 1.8 It is reasonably expected that $1.1 million of the $1.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits will settle in the next twelve months. The Company does not expect this change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company. 43 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In accordance with the adoption of FIN 48, we continue to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. As of February 4, 2007 and February 2, 2008, the Company has accrued $926,000 and $1,270,000, respectively, of interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company files U.S. federal and state tax returns. For the federal tax returns, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2003. With limited exception, our significant state tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to examinations by the various tax authorities for fiscal years prior to 2001. 5. Earnings Per Share The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per-share computations for each of the past three years: Income (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount For the year ended February 2, 2008: Basic earnings per share $ 16,435,000 8,897,518 $ 1.85 Effect of dilutive securitiesstock options 37,016 (0.01 ) Dilutive earnings per share $ 16,435,000 8,934,534 $ 1.84 For the year ended February 3, 2007: Basic earnings per share $ 34,791,000 8,801,661 $ 3.95 Effect of dilutive securitiesstock options 53,413 (0.02 ) Dilutive earnings per share $ 34,791,000 8,855,074 $ 3.93 For the year ended January 28, 2006: Basic earnings per share $ 18,277,000 8,746,363 $ 2.09 Effect of dilutive securitiesstock options 67,977 (0.02 ) Dilutive earnings per share $ 18,277,000 8,814,340 $ 2.07 The computation for diluted number of shares excludes unexercised stock options which are anti-dilutive. There were 193,144, zero, and zero of anti-dilutive shares for the years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007, and January 29, 2006, respectively. 6. Commitments and Contingencies Leases We lease our current facility under an operating lease expiring on July 31, 2010. We also have two three-year options to extend this lease for a total of 6 more years, to July 31, 2016. The future minimum non-cancellable lease payments are as follows: Operating Leases Fiscal 2009 $ 150,000 Fiscal 2010 150,000 Fiscal 2011 75,000 Total future minimum lease payments $ 375,000 44 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Total rent expense was $132,000, $115,000 and $115,000 for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively. Indemnities and Guarantees During the normal course of business, we make certain contractual guarantees and indemnities pursuant to which we may be required to make future payments under specific circumstances. We have not recorded any liability for these contractual guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. A description of significant contractual guarantees and indemnities existing as of February 2, 2008 is included below: Trademark Indemnities We indemnify certain customers against liability arising from third-party claims of intellectual property rights infringement related to our trademarks. These indemnities appear in our licensing agreements with our customers, are not limited in amount or duration and generally survive the expiration of the contracts. Given that the amount of any potential liabilities related to such indemnities cannot be determined until an infringement claim has been made, we are unable to determine the maximum amount of losses that it could incur related to such indemnifications. Management Agreement We have entered into a management agreement with our Chief Executive Officer as described below in Note 7. 7. Related Party Transactions The services of Mr. Robert Margolis, as our Chief Executive Officer are provided to us pursuant to a management agreement (the "Management Agreement"). The Management Agreement, as amended, provides for certain base compensation and bonuses, as defined, payable to Mr. Margolis. The initial term of the Management Agreement was until February 2, 2002, however, it will automatically be extended for each consecutive one year period in the event that pre-tax earnings, as defined, exceed specified levels as agreed upon by the Company's Compensation Committee. The Management Agreement provides that, for each fiscal year after fiscal 2000, if our EBITDA for such fiscal year is no less than $5.0 million, then Mr. Margolis will receive a performance bonus equal to 10% of our EBITDA for such fiscal year in excess of $2.5 million up to $10.0 million, plus 15% of our EBITDA for such fiscal year in excess of $10.0 million. For fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 Mr. Margolis' base compensation and bonuses were $4.1 million, $8.7 million, and $4.4 million, respectively. As of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, our accrued liabilities includes a bonus payable of $3.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively, for Mr. Margolis. If our EBITDA continues to increase, the bonus payable to Mr. Margolis under the management agreement will also increase. If the Company fails to meet the criteria for extending the term of the Management Agreement in any particular fiscal year, the Management Agreement will not be extended in that year and will thereafter be scheduled to expire two-years from the date of such failure, but the Management Agreement will remain eligible to be extended by an additional year in any subsequent fiscal year during the term of the Management Agreement in which the criteria to extend the term of the Management Agreement are is satisfied. Pre-tax earnings for Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 exceeded specified levels as agreed upon by the Company's Compensation Committee thereby automatically extending the Management Agreement to February 1, 2011. The Management Agreement 45 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) also provides that Mr. Margolis may nominate one director to the Board of Directors and certain other investors may nominate one director to the Board of Directors. The Management Agreement may be terminated at any time without cause or in the event of certain circumstances, as defined. If we terminate the agreement without cause or Mr. Margolis terminates the agreement if we materially breach the terms and conditions of the agreement or fail to perform any material obligation there under, Mr. Margolis is entitled to receive within 60 days of termination, a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of his annual base compensation and the previous year's performance bonus (the "Termination Payment"). On August 28, 2007, we entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Management Agreement which amends, among other things, the provisions regarding the Termination Payment to reduce the payment by disregarding all revenues received from Mossimo, Inc. during Fiscal 2007 and also the related expenses associated with the termination of the Finder's Agreement. The Amendment was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders on August 28, 2007. In the event the Management Agreement, as amended, was terminated as described above the Termination Payment for Mr. Margolis would be approximately $12.5 million. On October 8, 2007, the Company entered into a contingent Finders Fee Agreement (the "Contingent Finders Fee Agreement") with a director pertaining to his services as a director of the Company in introducing the Company to its licensee for the Cherokee brand in India. The Contingent Finders Fee Agreement calls for the director to receive 5% of all royalty revenues received by the Company in years 6 through 10 (and possibly years 11 through 15) only if the licensee decides to renew the licensing agreement beyond the original five year term to a second five year term (years 6 through 10), and again if another five year term is renewed (years 11 through 15). The Contingent Finders Fee Agreement expires at the earlier of (i) termination of the licensing agreement with the subject licensee for India, or (ii) ten years of payments (through year 15). The director has not received any payments or other compensation and will not receive any payments under the Contingent Finders Fee Agreement during the original five year term. In the event that the licensing agreement with the licensee is not renewed after the first five-year term, there will be no payments of any type made to the recipient under the Contingent Finders Fee Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, in connection with the closing of the termination of the Finders Agreement between the Company and Mossimo, Inc., which resulted in a payment to the Company of $33.0 million, the Company awarded one of the directors of the Company a bonus in the amount of $50,000 for his extraordinary board services. The director closely oversaw management's activities in connection with the negotiation and consummation of the termination of the Finders Agreement and the termination and settlement agreement between the Company and Iconix Brand Group, Inc. ("Iconix") entered into as of April 27, 2006 in connection with Iconix's acquisition of Mossimo. The Board determined that given the size and the complexity of these transactions, close board oversight was appropriate, and the $50,000 bonus was paid for the additional time performing such oversight. The payment was approved by the disinterested members of the Company's Board of Directors. 8. Capitalization Preferred Stock We are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors can determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions on the preferred stock and the class and 46 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) voting rights. As of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. Common Stock On July 22, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares or of our then outstanding common stock. Pursuant to this directive, we have used cash of $5.5 million to repurchase and retire 607,800 shares of our common stock with the last repurchase occurring in our fiscal year ended February 1, 2003. Our Board of Directors has authorized and approved the extension of the expiration date of our stock repurchase program to January 31, 2010 and increased the number of remaining shares which could currently be repurchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions to a total of 800,000 shares of our common stock. During Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. Dividends The Company has made a quarterly dividend payment to stockholders during each quarter of fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. On January 29, 2008 we declared a dividend of $0.75 per share or $6,685,000 which was paid on March 14, 2008. In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare additional dividends depending upon Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by Cherokee's Board of Directors. Stock-Based Compensation We currently maintain three equity-based compensation plans: (i) the Cherokee 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1995 Plan"); (ii) the 2003 Incentive Award Plan (the "2003 Plan"); and (iii) the 2006 Incentive Award Plan (the "2006 Plan"). Each of these stock option award plans provides for the issuance of equity-based awards to officers and other employees and directors, and they have previously been approved by our stockholders. Stock options issued to employees are granted at the market price on the date of grant, generally vest over a three-year period, and generally expire seven to ten years from the date of grant. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options. 1995 PlanThe 1995 Plan was approved at the October 1995 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under which the Company is authorized to grant up to 900,000 shares of common stock in the form of incentive and nonqualified options. During fiscal 2005, we granted the remaining 20,310 options available for issuance under the 1995 Plan. The options vest in equal installments over a three-year period starting at the grant date and have a term of ten years. As of February 2, 2008, we have no shares available for grants of options under the 1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan expired on July 24, 2005. 2003 PlanThe 2003 Plan was approved at the June 2003 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under which the Company is authorized to grant up to 250,000 shares of common stock in the form of incentive and nonqualified options and restricted stock awards. The maximum number of shares which may be subject to granted under the 2003 Plan to any individual in any calendar year cannot exceed 100,000. The principal purposes of the 2003 Plan is to provide additional incentive for our directors, employees and consultants to further our growth development and financial success and to enable us to obtain and retain their services. The Compensation Committee of the Board or another committee thereof (the "Committee") will administer the 2003 Plan with respect to grants to our employees or consultants and the full Board of Directors will administer the 2003 Plan with respect to grants to 47 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) independent directors. Under the 2003 Plan, restricted stock may be sold to participants at various prices (but not below par value) and made subject to such restrictions as may be determined by the Board or Committee. The vesting period and term for options granted under the 2003 Plan is set by the Committee, with the term being no greater than 10 years, and the Options generally will vest over a specific time period as designated by the Committee upon the awarding of such Options. During Fiscal 2008, we did not grant any options under the 2003 Plan. During Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, we granted options under the 2003 Plan to purchase 50,644, and 100,000 shares of common stock, respectively. As of February 2, 2008, there were 4,167 shares available for option grants under the 2003 Plan as a result of the forfeiture of these options by an employee who left the Company in Fiscal 2008. In the event that any outstanding option under the 2003 Plan expires or is terminated (forfeited), the shares of common stock allocable to the unexercised portion of the option shall then become available for grant in the future, until the 2003 Plan expires on April 17, 2013. 2006 PlanThe 2006 Plan was approved at the June 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under which the Company is authorized to grant up to 250,000 shares of common stock in the form of incentive and nonqualified options and restricted stock awards. The maximum number of shares which may be subject to grant under the 2006 Plan to any individual in any calendar year cannot exceed 100,000. The principal purposes of the 2006 Plan is to provide an additional incentive for our directors, employees and consultants and its subsidiaries to further our growth development and financial success and to enable us to obtain and retain their services. The Compensation Committee of the Board or another committee thereof (the "Committee") will administer the 2006 Plan with respect to grants to our employees or consultants and the full Board will administer the 2006 Plan with respect to grants to independent directors. Under the 2006 Plan, restricted stock may be sold to participants at various prices (but not below par value) and made subject to such restrictions as may be determined by the Board or Committee. The vesting period and term for Options granted under the 2006 Plan shall be set by the Committee, with the term being no greater than 10 years, and the Options generally will vest over a specific time period as designated by the Committee upon the awarding of such Options. During Fiscal 2008, we granted options under the 2006 Plan to purchase 245,000 shares of common stock of which 10,000 shares were forfeited as a result of employees leaving the Company in Fiscal 2008. As of February 2, 2008 we have 15,000 shares available for grants of options under the 2006 Plan. In the event that any outstanding option granted under the 2006 Plan expires or is terminated (forfeited), the shares of common stock allocable to the unexercised portion of the option shall then become available for grant in the future, until the 2006 Plan expires on April 28, 2016. Effective January 29, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method which requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations. Under the modified prospective method, we are required to recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet fully vested as of January 28, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions under the original SFAS 123. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123(R) for the twelve months ended February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 was $776,000 and $705,000, respectively. 48 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The estimated fair value of options granted during Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007 as of each grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Expected Dividend Yield 6.9% to 7.2% 6.1 % Expected Volatility 27.9% to 32.7% 31.5 % Risk-Free Interest Rate 4.4% to 4.5% 4.9 % Expected Life (in years) 4.5 4.5 The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term. Our dividend yield is based on the past dividends paid and the current dividend yield at the time of grant. A summary of activity for the Company's stock options as of and for Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 is as follows: Shares Weighted Average Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding, at January 29, 2005 225,522 $ 17.45 Granted 100,000 34.22 Exercised (117,239 ) 12.95 Canceled/forfeited (5,334 ) 23.12 Outstanding, at January 28, 2006 202,949 $ 28.28 Granted 50,644 39.26 Exercised (46,999 ) 26.28 Canceled/forfeited   Outstanding, at February 3, 2007 206,594 $ 31.42 Granted 245,000 $ 40.11 Exercised (16,524 ) $ 25.40 Canceled/forfeited (14,167 ) $ 41.65 Outstanding, at February 2, 2008 420,903 $ 36.37 5.49 $  Vested and Exercisable at February 2, 2008 122,134 $ 29.19 4.01 $ 501,000 Unvested and not exercisable at February 2, 2008 298,769 $ 39.31 6.09 $  The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted under the plans for Fiscal Year 2008, Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2006 was $6.09, $7.13 and $10.17, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between our closing stock price on February 2, 2008 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on February 2, 2008. This amount changes based on the fair market value of 49 CHEROKEE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) our stock. The total intrinsic value of options exercised for Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 was $325,000, $735,000 and $2.6 million, respectively. As of February 2, 2008, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $1.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.25 years. The total fair value of all options which vested during Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 was $699,000, $579,000 and $441,000, respectively. The fair value of each option grant in prior periods was estimated as of each grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, using the following assumptions: Fiscal 2006 Grant Date April 7, 2006 # of Options Granted 104,690 Expected Dividend Yield 6.0% Expected Volatility 50.0% Risk-Free Interest Rate 3.8% Expected Life (in years) 5.0 Prior to January 28, 2006, the Company accounted for its fixed stock options using the intrinsic value method, as prescribed by APB 25. Accordingly, no stock option expense was recorded in periods prior to January 28, 2006. The reported net income and earnings per share for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 is presented below to reflect the impact had the Company been required to recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant date for stock options as required under SFAS 123 (R). The pro forma amounts are as follows: Year Ended January 28, 2006 Net income: As reported $ 18,277,000 After-Tax Stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value method 301,000 Pro forma $ 17,976,000 Net income per sharebasic: As reported $ 2.09 Per share effect of after-tax stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value method (0.04 ) Pro forma $ 2.05 Net income per sharediluted: As reported $ 2.07 Per share effect of after-tax stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value method (0.04 ) Pro forma $ 2.03 50 Item 9.
