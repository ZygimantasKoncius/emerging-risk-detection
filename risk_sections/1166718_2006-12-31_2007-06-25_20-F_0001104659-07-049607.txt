D. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Financial ConditionCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our ability to borrow, invest and engage in various activities, which could impair our ability to expand or finance our future operations. Debt Our debt consists of notes, bank loans and vendor financing for property, plant and equipment, of which 81% are at fixed rates. The following table summarizes our debt position as of December 31, 2006 and 2005: At December 31, 2006 At December 31, 2005 (in thousands) Long-tem debt, including current portion: Notes $ 248,742 $ 304,024 Bank loans $ 34,219 $ 5,647 Vendor financing $ 36,189 $ 42,421 Total $ 319,150 $ 352,092 Short-term debt $ 123,849 $ 19,554 Total debt(1) $ 442,999 $ 371,646 Denominated in: U.S. dollars $ 171,013 $ 180,689 Euro $ 21,702 $ 15,081 Rubles $ 250,284 $ 175,876 (1) In November and December 2006, we raised $120.5 million in short-term loans primarily to finance our acquisitions. Our debt matures as follows: Year (in thousands) 2007 143,270 2008 167,068 2009 14,744 2010 110,256 2011 and thereafter 7,661 Notes U.S. Dollar Notes On May 21, 2003, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A. issued 8.5% Loan Participation Notes due 2008 for the sole purpose of funding a $150 million loan to WBD Foods. The loan will mature on May 21, 2008 and bears interest at an annual rate of 8.5%, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 21 and November 21 of each year. Two of our subsidiaries unconditionally, irrevocably, jointly and severally guarantee our obligation under the loan. The loan agreement contains a number of covenants including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. On February 06, 2007, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A. issued 7.5% Loan Participation Notes due 2008 for the sole purpose of funding a $150 million loan to WBD Foods. The loan will mature on May 14, 2008 and bears interest at an annual rate of 7.5%, payable in two installments on November 14, 2007 and 93 May 14, 2008. The loan agreement contains a number of covenants including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. Ruble Notes On December 21, 2005, WBD Foods issued 3 million non-convertible ruble denominated notes at a face value of 1,000 rubles each. The offering raised a total of 3 billion rubles ($113.9 million at the exchange rate as of December 31, 2006). The notes are redeemable by WBD Foods on December 15, 2010. The interest rate of the coupon is 9%. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on June 21, 2006. Bank Loans Substantially all of our long-term bank loans as of December 31, 2006 consisted of ruble and euro-denominated loans from Sberbank, Russian Agricultural Bank and Moscow City Government at interest rates ranging from 3.3% to 6.2%. Our short-term debt balance as of December 31, 2006 consisted of subsidized loans from Alfa-bank and the Moscow City Government at interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 3.8%. We also had loans from the International Moscow Bank, Raiffaisenbank and Alfa-bank at interest rates ranging from 7.8% to 9.1%. Our newly acquired Manros and Molka plants have unsubsidized loans at interest rates ranging from 9.3% to 14.0%. Vendor Finance We have agreements with suppliers of equipment which provide financing for the periods ranging from 1 to 9 years. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, vendor financing obligations were $21.0 million and $29.7 million, respectively, EURO 10.6 million and EURO 10 million (equivalent to $14.0 million and $11.9 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively) 30.9 million rubles and 23.2 million rubles (equivalent to $1.2 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively). This financing is provided at interest rates of LIBOR plus 1.5%, EURIBOR plus 1.5% and 14.0% for U.S. dollar, EURO and ruble denominated contracts, respectively. The majority of equipment financing is provided by one supplier, Tetra Pak. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, property, plant and equipment amounting to $33.1 million and $47.7 million, respectively, served as collateral under these financing agreements. Cash Flows A summary of our cash flows from continuing operations is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Cash provided by operating activities $ 167,252 $ 113,937 $ 71,720 Cash used in investing activities (228,158 ) (125,157 ) (73,808 ) Cash provided (used in) by financing activities 1,359 82,619 (16,159 ) Impact of exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents 6,754 (2,087 ) 1,774 Net increase (decrease) in cash (52,793 ) 69,312 (16,473 ) Cash paid for acquisition of property, plant and equipment $ (127,713 ) $ (72,805 ) $ (68,103 ) Cash paid for acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired (134,367 ) (24,964 ) (6,697 ) Vendor financed acquisitions of property, plant and equipment 5,561 5,709 7,335 94 In 2006, we financed our capital expenditures and acquisitions exclusively through operating cash flows. We spent $228.2 million on our investment activities in 2006, including acquisitions of property, plant and equipment of $127.7 million, acquisitions of subsidiaries of $134.4 million and investments in direct financing leases of $1.5 million, offset by $33.1 million proceeds from return of short-term bank deposits, $0.9 million proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment and $1.4 million proceeds from other long-term assets. Vendor financed acquisitions of property, plant and equipment totaled $5.6 million in 2006 compared to $5.7 million in 2005 because of an overall reduction in our vendor financed capital expenditures, including the improvement of packaging facilities. Instead, we are shifting our capital expenditures towards construction and installation projects, which are typically not vendor-financed. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was $167.3 million, compared to $113.9 million in 2005. The increase in 2006 was due to profitable growth and better management of our working capital, including a reduction of tax receivables balance. Working Capital Our short-term demands for liquidity, including seasonal fluctuations in working capital requirements, are met by cash flows from operations and short-term debt. As of December 31, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $40.3 million, of which $39.2 million was ruble-denominated and $1.1 million were euro and U.S. dollar-denominated. We used cash to repay our ruble notes redeemable on April 11, 2006 and partly finance acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our working capital balance was $90.4 million. Our working capital position as of December 31, 2006 decreased compared to $199.9 million as of December 31, 2005 primarily due to an increase in trade accounts payable and short-term loans, outpacing trade receivables and inventory growth. We believe that our working capital is sufficient for our present requirements. Tax receivables decreased by $10.3 million to $51.2 million as of December 31, 2006 from $61.5 million as of December 31, 2005. Tax receivables represent VAT and other taxes owed to us by the state budget. The decrease as of December 31, 2006 was primarily due to our recovery of certain VAT receivables from the state budget for previous years. Under existing tax legislation, we are able to offset this VAT against income taxes and other taxes payable to the state budget and to recover from the state budget. We are taking all legally available steps, including filing litigation claims, to facilitate the recovery of tax receivables from the state budget. In 2006, $31.2 million in VAT tax was recovered from the state budget in cash and $9.4 million was reimbursed by an offset. We also received $1.97 million from the tax authorities as interest that was accrued on the amount of VAT not refunded within the established time limit. Trade accounts payables increased to $104.1 million at December 31, 2006 from $65.8 million at December 31, 2005. Trade payables turnover averaged 26 days as of December 31, 2006 and 24 days as of December 31, 2005. Trade receivables increased from $60.0 million as of December 31, 2005 to $89.9 million as of December 31, 2006 after the allowance for bad debts of $7.1 million, as compared to $5.1 million as of December 31, 2005. Trade receivables turnover averaged 16 days as of December 31, 2006 and 16 days as of December 31, 2005. Inventory increased from $130.6 million as of December 31, 2005 to $174.1 million as of December 31, 2006. Turnover of inventory in days as of December 31, 2006 amounted to 47 days, as compared to 56 days as of December 31, 2005. The increase in inventory levels was mainly due to an increase in our stock of 95 finished goods as a result of adding Manros and Ochakovo dairy plants to our balance sheet at the end of 2006. Credit Rating Discussion Our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, and the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of factors, including our operating cash flows, total debt outstanding, commitments, interest requirements, liquidity needs and availability of liquidity. Other factors considered may include our business strategy, the condition of our industry and our position within the industry. Although we understand that these and other factors are among those considered by the rating agencies, each agency might calculate and weigh each factor differently. Our credit ratings as of the date of this document are as follows: Rating Agency Companys rating Long-Term Debt Rating Outlook/Watch Moodys(1) B1 B1 positive Standard & Poors(2) B+ B+ positive (1) Rated on March 29, 2007. (2) Rated on December 23, 2005. The two loan agreements relating to each of our two $150 million loan participation notes due 2008 contain, in each case, provisions requiring, subject to certain conditions, our prepayment of the loan in full in the event that a change in control or merger results in a decline in our credit ratings Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require the application of managements most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments that are sufficiently sensitive to give materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our most critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. Estimates and assumptions The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples include estimates of provisions for bad and doubtful accounts, obsolete inventory, and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 96 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts is established if there is objective evidence that we will not be able to collect the amounts due according to original contractual terms and reduces receivables to amounts expected to be collected. In estimating uncollectible amounts, we consider factors such as current overall economic conditions, industry-specific economic conditions, historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance. Our provisions cover individual balances where there is evidence that losses are probable as at the balance sheet date. We use significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts. While we believe our processes effectively address our exposure for doubtful accounts, changes in the economy, industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Income Taxes We assess the temporary differences resulting from differential treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We assess our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and adjusting the valuation allowance appropriately. In calculating our valuation allowance we consider the future taxable incomes and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives. If we estimate that the deferred tax asset cannot be realized at the recorded value, a valuation allowance is created with a charge to the statement of income in the period in which such assessment is made. Inventory Valuation We review our inventory balances to determine if inventories can be sold at amounts equal to or greater than their carrying amounts. The review includes identification of slow moving inventories, obsolete inventories, expired inventories and discontinued products or lines of products. The identification process includes historical performance of the inventory, current operational plans for the inventory, as well as industry and customer specific trends. Obsolete items are provided or written off. If our actual results differ from our expectations with respect to the selling of our inventories at amounts equal to or greater then their carrying amounts, we would be required to adjust our inventories accordingly. Depreciation periods for property, plant and equipment Depreciation periods of property, plant and equipment are based on estimated useful lives of related assets. The adoption of depreciation periods requires judgment in determining appropriate estimated useful lives over which the related assets will be utilized. In estimating useful lives, we consider factors such as our historical experience and the industry, manufacturers estimates, anticipated use and our maintenance policies. As these factors change, management estimates may change and we could be required to reassess depreciation periods for property, plant and equipment and consider impairment. Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets When events and circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset (group) may not be recoverable, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to derive from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (group). If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group), we would then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset (group) over the estimate of its recoverable amount, which is the higher of either fair market value or value in use. We carry out the impairment test for property, plant and equipment and goodwill when indicators exist. For purposes of determining goodwill recognition, we perform a review for possible impairment of goodwill at least on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less 97 than the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill, we would then calculate the impairment loss as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its implied fair value, which is to be recognized in same manner as the amount of goodwill is recognized in a business combination. Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (the FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. In addition, FIN 48 clearly scopes out income taxes from Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The adoption of the provisions of FIN 48 did not have material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, which amends SFASs No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This Statement resolves issues addressed in Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement 133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation and clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives. SFAS No. 155 amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. These provisions of SFAS No. 155 are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, which amends SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This Statement requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. This Statement permits, but does not require, the subsequent measurement of servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value. An entity that uses derivative instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in servicing assets and servicing liabilities is required to account for those derivative instruments at fair value. These provisions of SFAS No. 156 are effective at the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 156 is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. 98 This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which amends SFASs No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This Statement improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not-for-profit organization. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 158 is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows as the we do not have a defined benefit postretirement plan. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007; however, early adoption is allowed. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have an impact on the our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. We invest significant financial and human resources in new product development, focusing on long-term strategic projects aimed at creating innovative products and technologies. Our research and development department focuses on new project development for all three of our business segments. It is located at Lianozovsky Dairy Plant and has more than 40 employees. A new structure uniting all quality control departments has also been put in place and is presently located at Lianozovsky Dairy Plant. These departments often cooperate with third parties such as Russian research institutions, specialized research firms and suppliers. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we spent approximately $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $0.6 million on activities associated with new product development. For a more detailed discussion of new product development see 
