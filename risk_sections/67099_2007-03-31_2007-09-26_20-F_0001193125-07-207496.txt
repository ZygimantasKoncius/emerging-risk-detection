Risk Factors. With respect to oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) business, in our view, the key to success is to constantly increase, or at a minimum maintain, certain volumes of oil and gas reserve prospects as is the common practice for international oil and gas companies. However, despite our managements intensive focus on expanding our E&P business activities, our oil and gas reserves are still far less than that of the national oil companies of oil producing countries and major oil and gas companies. Other Japanese companies that participate in E&P activities do not commonly disclose their proved oil and gas reserves. Based on the limited proved oil and gas reserves information of other Japanese E&P companies that are publicly available, we believe that we generally have higher amounts of proved oil and gas reserves as compared to most Japanese E&P companies. Accordingly, we believe that we are competitive with other Japanese E&P companies. We are also exploring various new business opportunities in the emerging new energy area. Mitsui expects bio-ethanol to be a crucial renewable fuel in the future, and world demand to rise significantly. In April 2006, Mitsui reached an agreement with Petróleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) to jointly carry out a feasibility study for production of bio-ethanol and related products in Brazil and for the marketing of such products in the international market. As of the date of this annual report, both parties are studying on integrated supply chain within Brazil. The international markets for crude oil and petroleum products are highly competitive and volatile. In maintaining our competitive edge under these circumstances, it is critical for us to maintain good relationships with customers and suppliers as well as to mitigate price risks by utilizing hedging tools such as the futures markets. We are active in seeking to secure long-term offtake contracts of petroleum products such as fuel oil and condensate to be sold to worldwide companies including Japanese utility and refining companies. Long-term offtake contracts are sales and purchase contracts for various commodities, such as crude oil and petroleum products, entered into by suppliers and buyers, or offtakers, of such commodities for more than one year. 39 Table of Contents Concurrent with the offtake contracts, the sellers of such commodities usually enter into financing arrangements whereby the sales proceeds from such commodities are used for repayment. For example, on February, 2004, the Energy Business Unit entered into an offtake contract with PERUSAHAAN PERTAMBANGAN MINYAK DAN GAS BUMINEGRA (PERTAMINA), the national oil and gas company of Indonesia, and committed itself to take low sulfur waxy residue produced from PERTAMINA for a period of time, and arranged debt financing for a construction of condensate refinery and petrochemical plant totaling approximately US$400 million, supporting the completion of the construction work and start-up of commercial production which had been suspended due to economic crisis of Indonesia. PERTAMINA has supplied us with the low sulfur waxy residue from its existing refineries and the proceeds from the sales of these products will be used as the source of debt service for the US$400 million loan. The Energy Business Unit is engaged in oil trading operations conducted by Mitsui and Mitsui Oil (Asia) Hong Kong Ltd. (Hong Kong, China). In February 2007, it decided to wind down Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) and liquidate it by March 31, 2008, following a discovery of concealed significant losses on naphtha trading. Within Japan, we are also engaged in refining and sales of oil and gas related products through Kyokuto Petroleum Industries, Ltd. (Japan), a refinery jointly owned (50:50) by the ExxonMobil Corp. Group and our oil sales subsidiary, Mitsui Oil Co., Ltd. (Japan). In the domestic refining and marketing business for oil and gas related products, we have faced severe competition from domestic oil refining and distributing companies due to the structural surplus situation for refining capacity in Japan. Kyokuto Petroleum Industries, Ltd. (Japan), Mitsui Oil Co., Ltd. (Japan) and Mitsui Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan), our core associated company and subsidiaries for domestic oil and gas refining and marketing business activities are in relatively sound financial situations owing to the extensive restructuring of inefficient assets and work force, and are pursuing efficient and competitive operations. Japanese Government environmental regulations stipulate that sulfur content must be reduced to 10 parts per million (ppm) beginning in 2007 for diesel oil and in 2008 for gasoline. Major Japanese oil refineries and distributors voluntarily started to supply 10 ppm standard products beginning in January 2005, before the restriction came into effect. To maintain a competitive position in the market, Kyokuto Petroleum Industries, Ltd. has invested in new equipment to strengthen its sulfur removal capabilities. Transformation of its diesel oil equipment was completed in April 2005 and so was gasoline equipment in February 2007. With respect to our LNG related operations, we have entered into various long term sales contracts, based on take or pay conditions, with customers such as Japanese utility companies. We believe the worldwide LNG business has been undergoing gradual structural changes since the late 1990s as follows:  Exploration and development of natural gas and production of LNG require significant capital and financial commitments. Moreover, this involves a broad range of logistical and technological expertise, including linking suppliers to distributors and consumers while developing plants in order to efficiently extract and liquefy the natural gas for transportation and then re-gasifying the LNG. Up until the mid-1990s, purchase commitments by buyers with full take or pay obligations for a period of 20 years or more had been an essential element for equity holders, distributors and sellers of LNG projects to make the capital and financial commitment to build LNG production facilities. These equity investors had resisted making a capital and financial commitment without being able to fully secure stable long-term purchase commitments. In recent years, however, equity holders of several LNG projects have been making investments without fully securing long-term purchase commitments from buyers.  Due to technological innovations in the last decade, LNG producers have successfully reduced capital costs with respect to the construction of LNG production plants and LNG vessels. Technological innovation has also enabled the producers to increase the design capacities of LNG production plants 40 Table of Contents and LNG vessels allowing them to benefit from economies of scale. These technological developments allow LNG to be more competitive with other types of energy sources.  In response to the needs of LNG buyers, the LNG spot market has been expanding, whereby the percentage of spot trades in worldwide LNG contracts rose to 16% in 2006 from 1.3% in 1992.  In addition to the traditional core LNG markets in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, the market is rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States. At the same time, new markets have been emerging in countries such as China and India due to an increasing demand for electricity. Considering the sizable economies of these countries and the increasing popularity of LNG as a clean energy source, the LNG market has been developing rapidly worldwide. The recent structural changes in the LNG industry, including those mentioned above, continue to have a mixed effect on our business operations. For example, due to the reduction in capital costs from technological innovations, the emergence of the spot LNG market and other factors, not only has the LNG industry become more competitive among existing energy-related companies, but it has also seen an increase of new entrants.

Mitsui Europe collaborates with our subsidiaries and associated companies of other operating segments. In April 2005, this segment reorganized its internal structure. Before the change, each of those operating subsidiaries independently reported to the Managing Director of Mitsui Europe, with the result that their business plans and operations tended to be limited to specific countries. In order to accelerate business development based on a product strategy that encompasses the whole of Europe, this segment introduced a Business Division System within Europe, in which Divisional Operating Officers oversee operations by products and services in the region and directly report to Managing Director of Mitsui Europe.

Among others, we place a high priority on establishment of logistics network within China. For example:  In March 2003, we entered into a comprehensive strategic alliance with China Postal Logistics Co., Ltd. Through this alliance, we are in a position to utilize the facilities and distribution networks of Chinas postal service, the China State Post Bureau.  Mitsui International Logistics and Trade (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., in which Mitsui & Co., (China) Ltd. has minority share, has the right to conduct import and export under our own name outside a bonded area.

IRON ORE Name of Joint Venture or Investee Entity by which Mitsui Participates in the Mining Activity and its Ownership Interest Area of Mining Operation (Region, State, Country) Robe River Iron Associates Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (33%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia Mesa J The development of the Robe River project began in 1962(*) near Pannawonica. The Robe River project was commissioned and the first shipment was made in 1972. Iron ore reserves at the Mesa J production Base provide the cornerstone of Pannawonicas sinter fines and lump output. Development of Mesa J began in 1992, and all mine administration, workshops, warehousing and other support facilities were integrated there in 1994. The mine produces Rove River fines and lump, which are pisolitic iron ore products. Process Plant 1 was commissioned in 1999 and Process Plant 2 in 2001. The plant processes clay-contaminated pisolite, sub-grade material which was once discarded, to reduce contaminants and retain on-specification ore. West Angelas The development of West Angelas began in 1998. Mining of ore commenced in March 2002. The West Angelas deposits contain Marra Mamba type iron ore with higher iron content than Robe Rivers Mesa J mine. The West Angelas operation is comprised of an open pit mine, a crushing and screening ore processing plant producing lump and sinter fines iron ore, as well as stockpiling, reclaiming and train-loading facilities. Further expansion of the West Angelas mine was completed ahead of schedule in October 2005. This US$105 million project took the mines production capacity to 25 million tonnes per year. Robe River Iron Associates uses a dedicated rail system, operated by Pilbara Iron, to transport ore from its mines to the companys deepwater port facilities at Cape Lambert. Also, a US$200 million rail expansion project to duplicate almost 100 kilometers of track and associated interconnection and infrastructure to increase the capacity of the Pilbara Iron main line completed in the first quarter of 2006. In January 2007, a further expansion plan was decided to increase port capacity at Cape Lambert from nameplate capacity of 55 to 80 million tones per year by the end of 2008. Completion of the expansion is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the total cost of the capital is estimated approximately US$860 million. (*) The Robe River project was originally started by Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company, an iron and steel producer in the United States. Since then, there were major changes in ownership before Rio Tinto took a 53% stake in Robe River Iron Associates in 2000. Mount Newman Joint Venture Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. (10%) (Mitsui share of Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. is 70%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia Mount Whaleback The joint venture began production in 1969 at the Mount Whaleback ore body. Today, production continues to be sourced from the major Mount Whaleback ore body and is complemented by production from other ore bodies, namely Orebody 18, 23, 25, 29 and 30 and Jimblebar, which we are involved in through the Wheelarra arrangement with BHP Iron Ore (Jimblebar) Pty Ltd, Itochu Minerals & Energy Australia Pty Ltd, and 4 Chinese steel companies. The facilities at Mount Whaleback include primary and secondary crushing plants with a nominal capacity of 35 million tonnes of product per year, a heavy media beneficiation plant with an annual capacity of 8 million tonnes and a train-loading facility. An additional primary and secondary crushing plant is present at Orebody 25 with a nominal capacity of eight million tonnes of product per year. 65 Table of Contents Yandi Joint Venture Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (7%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia Marillana Creek Development of the ore body began in 1991 with a capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum and the projects first shipment of iron ore was in March 1992. Capacity was progressively expanded between 1994 and 2003 and the current capacity is 42 million tonnes per annum. Two processing plants and a primary crusher and overland conveyor are used to crush and screen the Yandi ore and deliver it to one of two train loading facilities. Mount Goldsworthy Joint Venture Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (7%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia North Area (Yarrie) (Nimingarra) Mount Goldsworthy was commissioned in 1966 in the North Area. The original Goldsworthy mine was closed in 1982 and mining operations ceased at Shay Gap mine in 1993. Since then, mining has continued from the adjacent Nimingarra mine and Yarrie mine, 30 kilometers to the south-east. Two primary crushers exist, one at Yarrie and the other at Nimingarra. The ore is crushed and then railed to Port Hedland. Area C In October 2003, the joint venture opened the new Area C mine located 120 kilometers north-west of Newman, which produces a Marra Mamba ore deposit, which is sold under the trademark MAC. All production from the Mount Goldsworthy North (Yarrie and Nimingarra deposits) is transported on a separate railway to Port Hedland. Ore from Area C is transported via a 39 kilometer new section of railway to the Yandi mine which then connects to the Newman main line to Port Hedland. From there, the venture ships the ore through the Nelson Point and Finucane Island facilities. The ore currently being produced at Area C is from C Deposit, which is an open-pit mine. The ore processing plant at Area C has a nominal capacity of 23 million tonnes of product per year. Development projects at joint ventures with BHP Billiton Ltd. The three joint ventures, namely, Mt. Newman joint venture, Yandi joint venture and Mt. Goldsworthy joint venture have been planning for staged expansions of supply capacity. As a step, in October 2005 they approved an expansion plan to add 20 million tonnes per annum to their capacity, upgrading combined capacity to 129 million tonnes per annum by 2007. The capital expenditure for the expansion work will total A$2.2 billion. Mitsui will bear approximately A$150 million. The expansion has been focusing mainly on Area C mine and encompass expansions of rail systems and the loading port. In addition, in March 2007, the joint ventures approved to increase annual production capacity to 155 million tonnes per annum by 2010. The capital expenditure for the expansion will total approximately A$2.7 billion. The expansion includes development of a new crushing and screening plant, as well as additional stockyard, car dumping and train loading facilities at Mt. Whaleback. Sesa Goa Limited Sesa Goa Limited(*) (51%) Goa and Karnataka, India Codli Sonshi Sesa Goa Limited commenced operations in 1954 in North Goa, India. Sesa Goas main mining operations are at the Codli and Sonshi mines. Goan ore tends to be relatively high in alumina content, and most Goan ore is beneficiated to raise the iron content. We acquired a 51% interest in Sesa Goa in 1996. Chitradurga Hospet The main operation in Karnataka is at Chitradurga mine. A second mine is located at Hospet. These mines are equidistant from the part of Mormugao and Chennai and ore can be shipped from either port. (*) We sold our whole stake in Sesa Goa Limited in April 2007. 66 Table of Contents COAL Name of Joint Venture or Investee Entity by which Mitsui Participates in the Mining Activity and its Ownership Interest Area of Mining Operation (Region, State, Country) BHP Mitsui Coal Pty.

The expected costs to develop these undeveloped reserves are estimated to be ¥502 billion in total as of March 31, 2007. Undeveloped reserves are largely attributable to an associated company in Russia and an associated company in Australia. 72 Table of Contents Production of crude oil in 2007 and LNG in 2008 are expected, for the associated company in Russia. Production of crude oil and LNG has already commenced at the existing facilities at the Australian company. The drilling of additional development wells will be performed over the project life according to the project drilling program. (3) The proved gas reserves are restricted to those volumes that are related to firm sales commitments. (4) Proved reserves attributable to Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., which became our consolidated subsidiary in the year ended March 31, 2007, are included in the figures as of March 31, 2007. The included figures are proved reserves of 19 million barrels of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and 265 billion cubic feet of natural gas, as well as proved developed reserves of 18 million barrels of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and 227 billion cubic feet of natural gas. These figures represent reserves on a 100% basis while our interest in Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. was 50.3% as of March 31, 2007. Information on our oil and gas producing activities is shown in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. And also see Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsOperating Results by Operating SegmentEnergy Segment. Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments We are a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There are no written comments which have been provided by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic reports under that Act not less than 180 days before the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and which remain unresolved as of the date of the filing of this Form 20-F with the Commission and which we believe are material. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects A. Operating Results You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. As used in this Operating and Financial Review and Prospects, Mitsui is used to refer to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui Bussan Kabushiki Kaisha), and we, us, and our are used to indicate Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. In the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is used to refer to Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and the companies is used to refer to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. All references to Note throughout the Operating and Financial Review and Prospects relate to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Throughout the Operating and Financial Review and Prospects, we describe the domicile of our subsidiaries and associated companies in parentheses following names of those companies. For example, Mitsui Iron Ore Development, Pty. Ltd. (Australia) means that the companys name is Mitsui Iron Ore Development, Pty. Ltd. and that it is domiciled in Australia. Operations of a subsidiary that either have been disposed of or are classified as held for sale have been accounted for as discontinued operations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This means that income statement and cash flow information are reclassified for all years to separate the discontinued operations from our continuing operations. This presentation is required by U.S. GAAP and facilitates historical and future trend analysis of our continuing operations. 73 Table of Contents Key Performance Measures under Managements Discussion Although our operating results and financial condition are influenced by various factors, management believes that as of the end of the fiscal year under review the following indicators can be usefully employed to discuss trends in our performance and financial condition. Gross profit, operating income* and equity in earnings of associated companies We undertake worldwide business activities, involving diversified risk-return profiles, ranging from intermediary services as agent to development and production activities of mineral resources and energy. In this context, changes in the amounts of gross profit, operating income and equity in earnings of associated companies by operating segment reflect the overall progress of our business, and greatly affect the amount of net income in the Statements of Consolidated Income. For further information, refer to the table of Operating Segment Information and subsequent discussions in Operating Results by Operating Segment in this Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. Trends in the price of and supply-demand for mineral resources and energy In recent years, we have observed a rapid growth in operating results from our mineral resources and energy producing activities and the significance of these operations in our overall operating results has considerably intensified. These results have been brought by rising prices as well as increased production in these operations, reflecting globally tightened supply-demand balance and increased price of mineral resources and energy that have been driven by expanding demand from emerging countries, particularly China. Furthermore, management recognize that for some time to come such global supply-demand balance and price fluctuations of mineral resources and energy will continuously have material impact, positive or negative, on our operating results, financial condition and business. For further information regarding trends and prospects in this field, refer to the sections relating to the Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment and the Energy Segment in Operating Results by Operating Segment. Investment plans and financial leverage According to our Medium-term Management Outlook announced in May 2006, we intended to invest a total of ¥800 billion during the two fiscal years ending March 2007 and 2008, in order to build strategic business portfolios in the four business areas of Mineral Resources and Energy Area; Global Marketing Networks Area, including steel products and chemicals; Infrastructure Area, including power generation; and Consumer Services Area, including outsourcing services and content businesses. As of the date of this annual report, we have observed a more rapid progress on investment plans than we had expected, and concurrently we have proactively implemented the divestiture of existing securities and fixed assets for portfolio restructuring. Mitsui is monitoring and managing group-wide financial leverage with a view of securing an efficient return on equity as well as maintaining and improving credit ratings and financial soundness in order to secure the capital resources required for these investments and to refinance our interest bearing debt. For further discussion on these investments and related financial policies, refer to B. Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. * Operating Income Operating income is included in the measure of segment performance reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. Operating income is comprised of our (a) gross profit, (b) selling, general and administrative expenses and (c) provision for doubtful receivables, as presented in the Statements of Consolidated Income. 74 Table of Contents Results of Operations Summary of Operations for the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Principal developments in the economic environment that influenced our results of operations during the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 included the following: Operating Environment for the Year Ended March 31, 2007  During the year ended March 31, 2007, the global economy overall continued its steady expansion. In the United States, corporate profits remained robust and consumer spending continued to increase due to favorable employment and wage conditions, and despite an easing in housing investment, which had been overheating, the economy performed steadily overall. In Asia, sustained high growth in China has continued driven by further increases in capital investments and exports to other regions. In Europe, the economy demonstrated a clear recovery trend, as illustrated by the growth of exports in Germany and other factors.  This broad-based expansion of the global economy underpinned strong international commodities markets. Prices of crude oil, mineral resources, non-ferrous metals and other commodities reached record-high levels in the summer, and despite falling thereafter, remain at high levels.  The global trend towards steadily higher interest rates continued. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), which had continued to raise interest rates progressively since June 2004, kept the rate constant since June 2006. In Europe, the European Central Bank continued to raise interest rates since 2005.  The Japanese economy continued its solid recovery. Exports continued to increase, bolstered by global economic expansion and the weakening yen. Strong corporate sector results led to high growth in capital investment, while improvements in employment and wages led to firmer consumer spending. The Bank of Japan decided to terminate its zero interest rate policy in July 2006, and raised the policy interest rate in February 2007, based on the robust recovery of the economy and consumer prices turning positive. In foreign exchange rates, the yen continued to weaken, particularly against the Euro, against which the yen recorded its lowest ever level since the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Operating Environment for the Year Ended March 31, 2006  The global economy continued its steady expansion driven by the growth in the United States, as well as emerging countries, particularly China. The expansion again brought higher consumption, housing investment and capital investment. Emerging countries especially continued strong economic growth led by increasing personal consumption from a growing middle-income class and by robust infrastructure demand.  These factors contributed to a substantial increase in global trade and spurred the rising trend in commodity prices such as crude oil, iron ore, coal and non-ferrous metals.  The Japanese economy entered a period of self-sustaining growth. Capital investment increased reflecting expansion of corporate earnings while improved employment and wages supported a favorable trend in personal consumption. In addition, export volume increased supported by an expansion of the global economy and the weak yen.  In the United States, the FRB continued its policy of raising interest rates, which resulted in a gradual rise in interest rates worldwide. In March 2006, the Bank of Japan terminated its quantitative easing policy, which it had followed for the prior five years. 75 Table of Contents Overview of the Financial Results for the Year Ended March 31, 2007  Operating results  For the year ended March 31, 2007, we recorded consolidated net income of ¥301.5 billion, an increase of ¥99.1 billion, or 49.0%, from ¥202.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Most operating segments except for the Foods & Retail Segment recorded improved operating results, benefiting from a favorable economic environment.  Gross profit and equity in earnings of associated companies increased by ¥85.4 billion, or 10.4%; and ¥58.8 billion, or 62.4%, respectively, reflecting favorable commodity prices including mineral resources and energy. On the other hand, Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) recorded impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets. In addition, interest expenses increased from increasing interest bearing debt mainly associated with the investment in the Sakhalin II project as well as a rising U.S. dollar interest rate.  Financial condition Total assets as of March 31, 2007 increased to ¥9.8 trillion, an increase of ¥1.2 trillion over March 31, 2006 due mainly to investments in energy, mineral resources and infrastructure businesses as well as an increase in trade receivables. Shareholders equity as of March 31, 2007 was ¥2.1 trillion as a result of increased retained earnings.  Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥239.3 billion, an increase of ¥92.9 billion from the year ended March 31, 2006 reflecting the steady growth of the operating income. Net cash used in investing activities was ¥418.0 billion, attributable to investments mainly in the energy; machinery and infrastructure projects; and mineral resources businesses. Overview of the Financial Results for the Year Ended March 31, 2006  Operating results  For the year ended March 31, 2006, we recorded consolidated net income of ¥202.4 billion, an increase of ¥81.3 billion, or 67.1%, from ¥121.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Most operating segments except for the Foods & Retail Segment recorded improved operating results, benefiting from a favorable economic environment.  Gross profit and equity in earnings of associated companies increased by ¥110.1 billion, or 15.5%; and ¥30.0 billion, or 46.7%, respectively, reflecting favorable commodity prices including mineral resources and energy. On the other hand, Mitalco Inc. (United States) and MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. (Japan) recorded significant one-time impairment losses on long-lived assets. In addition, interest expenses increased principally from the investment in the Sakhalin II project.  Financial condition Total assets as of March 31, 2006 reached ¥8.6 trillion mainly due to investments in the energy and mineral resources businesses, the infrastructure businesses and the foods and retail businesses; increases in trade receivables and inventories; and the increases in unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities. As a result of a public offering and increased retained earnings, our shareholders equity as of March 31, 2006 reached ¥1.7 trillion.  Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥146.4 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was ¥347.3 billion, resulting primarily from investments in energy and mineral resources businesses as well as infrastructure businesses. 76 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Fluctuation on Operating Results Due to the increase in gross profit and equity in earnings of associated companies discussed above, net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 reported by overseas subsidiaries and associated companies reached ¥252.4 billion, significantly higher than ¥174.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The impact of any appreciation of the yen against the currencies used by these companies as functional currency in their reportingprincipally U.S. dollars, Australian dollars and Eurosis becoming even more significant. The average U.S. dollaryen exchange rate during the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥116.96 = U.S.$1, representing yen depreciation of ¥3.03, or 2.7%, compared to the average rate during the year ended March 31, 2006 of ¥113.93 = U.S.$1. As of March 30, 2007, the U.S. dollaryen exchange rate was ¥118.05 = U.S.$1. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on net income for the year ending March 2008 will largely depend on the net income denominated in local currencies of overseas subsidiaries and associated companies. Based on net income in the business plans of these companies covering the year ending March 2008, we estimate that yen appreciation by ¥1 against U.S.$1 would have the net effect of reducing net income by approximately ¥2.2 billion. Discussion and Analysis of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues In accordance with U.S. GAAP, revenues are reported based on the gross amount billed to a customer or on the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) in the following manner.  Revenues are reported based on gross amounts for transactions where we have the related risks and rewards of ownership such as transactions mainly where we are a primary obligor in the arrangement and/or assume general inventory risk without any significant mitigation of our risk level.  Revenues are reported based on net amounts where we assume a low degree of related risks and rewards, effectively acting as an agent for the applicable products or services. A typical example of reporting revenues based on net amounts is a transaction where we receive a commission or fee at a fixed rate based on transaction volume or amount. We classified our revenues into sales of products, sales of services and other sales with the corresponding costs of revenues. 77 Table of Contents The table below provides these three categories of revenues by products in PRODUCT INFORMATION in Note 17, SEGMENT INFORMATION. (*) Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, 2007 2006 Change Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Iron and Steel ¥ 552.3 ¥ 71.5 ¥ 0.2 ¥ 624.0 ¥ 454.7 ¥ 68.8 ¥ 0.2 ¥ 523.7 ¥ 97.6 ¥ 2.7 ¥ 0.0 ¥ 100.3 Non-Ferrous Metals 71.2 9.0 19.7 99.9 77.7 9.2 15.3 102.2 (6.5 ) (0.2 ) 4.4 (2.3 ) Machinery 253.1 106.2 71.6 430.9 219.1 97.6 51.3 368.0 34.0 8.6 20.3 62.9 Electronics & Information 77.8 104.9 0.0 182.7 77.5 87.3 0.1 164.9 0.3 17.6 (0.1 ) 17.8 Chemicals 1,038.9 98.4 9.3 1,146.6 785.9 93.3 7.5 886.7 253.0 5.1 1.8 259.9 Energy 1,622.0 7.1 8.5 1,637.6 1,331.8 7.7 21.0 1,360.5 290.2 (0.6 ) (12.5 ) 277.1 Foods 417.2 49.3 0.5 467.0 377.8 47.2 (0.4 ) 424.6 39.4 2.1 0.9 42.4 Textiles 22.9 21.2 1.5 45.6 24.5 16.8 1.1 42.4 (1.6 ) 4.4 0.4 3.2 General Merchandise 55.3 8.1 0.0 63.4 69.8 9.0 0.0 78.8 (14.5 ) (0.9 ) 0.0 (15.4 ) Property and Service Business 63.3 81.7 38.0 183.0 60.9 75.3 27.5 163.7 2.4 6.4 10.5 19.3 Consolidated Total ¥ 4,174.0 ¥ 557.4 ¥ 149.3 ¥ 4,880.7 ¥ 3,479.7 ¥ 512.2 ¥ 123.6 ¥ 4,115.5 ¥ 694.3 ¥ 45.2 ¥ 25.7 ¥ 765.2 Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, 2006 2005 Change Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Iron and Steel ¥ 454.7 ¥ 68.8 ¥ 0.2 ¥ 523.7 ¥ 350.7 ¥ 55.7 ¥ 0.3 ¥ 406.7 ¥ 104.0 ¥ 13.1 ¥ (0.1 ) ¥ 117.0 Non-Ferrous Metals 77.7 9.2 15.3 102.2 137.5 8.4 15.9 161.8 (59.8 ) 0.8 (0.6 ) (59.6 ) Machinery 219.1 97.6 51.3 368.0 163.4 63.3 38.2 264.9 55.7 34.3 13.1 103.1 Electronics & Information 77.5 87.3 0.1 164.9 74.9 69.8 0.0 144.7 2.6 17.5 0.1 20.2 Chemicals 785.9 93.3 7.5 886.7 642.7 79.8 6.6 729.1 143.2 13.5 0.9 157.6 Energy 1,331.8 7.7 21.0 1,360.5 1,009.3 14.0 11.8 1,035.1 322.5 (6.3 ) 9.2 325.4 Foods 377.8 47.2 (0.4 ) 424.6 423.7 50.1 (0.2 ) 473.6 (45.9 ) (2.9 ) (0.2 ) (49.0 ) Textiles 24.5 16.8 1.1 42.4 22.1 19.8 1.1 43.0 2.4 (3.0 ) 0.0 (0.6 ) General Merchandise 69.8 9.0 0.0 78.8 86.0 10.2 (0.1 ) 96.1 (16.2 ) (1.2 ) 0.1 (17.3 ) Property and Service Business 60.9 75.3 27.5 163.7 53.7 63.0 22.9 139.6 7.2 12.3 4.6 24.1 Consolidated Total ¥ 3,479.7 ¥ 512.2 ¥ 123.6 ¥ 4,115.5 ¥ 2,964.0 ¥ 434.1 ¥ 96.5 ¥ 3,494.6 ¥ 515.7 ¥ 78.1 ¥ 27.1 ¥ 620.9 Sales of Products Sales of products include the following four types of transactions:  the sale of products as a principal in the transactions, such as crude oil and petroleum products; petrochemical products as well as steel products;  the sale of manufacturer products at our manufacturing subsidiaries such as feed additive by Novus International, Inc.

The major factors were as below:  Revenues from Iron and Steel and Chemicals increased by ¥13.1 billion and ¥13.5 billion, respectively. Favorable market conditions and increases in transaction volume resulted in the overall increase both at Mitsui and subsidiaries.  Revenues from Machinery increased by ¥34.3 billion, primarily attributable to the increases at overseas automobile-related subsidiaries through their logistics and distributorship services.  Revenues from Electronics & Information increased by ¥17.5 billion, attributable to the increases in the sales of information and communication services at NextCom K.K. (Japan) and Telepark Corp. (Japan). Other Sales Other sales principally include the revenues from derivative commodity instruments and derivative financial instruments held for trading purposes, the revenues from leasing activities of real estate, rolling stock, ocean transport vessels, aircraft and machinery equipment and the revenues from external consumer financing. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, revenues from other sales were ¥149.3 billion, an increase of ¥25.7 billion from ¥123.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, which was primarily attributable to the following factors:  Leasing revenues were ¥85.0 billion, an increase of ¥19.7 billion from ¥65.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, which was attributable to the expanded rolling stock leasing businesses at Mitsui Rail Capital Participacoes Ltda. (Brazil) and Mitsui Rail Capital Holdings, Inc. (United States) as well as the acquisition of Dispolok GmbH (Germany) and increases in the real estate leasing businesses in Japan and abroad.  Derivative trading revenues were ¥33.1 billion, a decrease of ¥6.6 billion from ¥39.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The principal reason for this decrease was naphtha trading losses at Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) for the year ended March 31, 2007.  P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) increased its revenue from other sales by ¥8.3 billion over the year ended March 31, 2006, reflecting its expansion of motorcycle retail finance in Indonesia. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 For the year ended March 31, 2006, revenues from other sales were ¥123.6 billion, an increase of ¥27.1 billion from ¥96.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, which was primarily attributable to the following factors:  Leasing revenues were ¥65.3 billion, an increase of ¥9.9 billion from the ¥55.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005 due to the contribution of KYOGI WAREHOUSE CO., LTD. (Japan) which was acquired during the year ended March 31, 2006 and Mitsui Rail Capital Holdings, Inc. (United States), a leasing company of rolling stock. 80 Table of Contents  Derivative trading revenues were ¥39.7 billion, an increase of ¥7.7 billion from the ¥32.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, reflecting strong energy derivatives trading at Mitsui & Co. Energy Risk Management Ltd. (United Kingdom), Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) and Mitsui Oil (Asia) Hong Kong Ltd. (Hong Kong, China).  P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) increased its revenue from other sales by ¥4.0 billion over the year ended March 31, 2005, reflecting its strong business performance in the motorcycle retail finance in Indonesia.

The Gross Profit ratio (GP ratio), or ratio of gross profit divided by revenues, for the year ended March 31, 2007 was 18.5%, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2006. Changes in gross profit and GP ratio classified by category of revenues are set forth below: For the year ended March 31, 2007, gross profit from sales of products was ¥430.8 billion, an increase of ¥60.7 billion from ¥370.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The major factors in this category are as follows:  Gross profit from Energy was ¥133.0 billion, an increase of ¥43.0 billion from ¥90.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. As a result of acquisition of Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan), a former associated company, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year under review, it newly reported a ¥15.0 billion gross profit and Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited (Australia) also reported gross profit of ¥13.9 billion following the start up of commercial production at the Enfield oil project. Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands), which is engaged in production of crude oil in Oman, recorded an increase reflecting higher oil prices. Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States) recorded a ¥4.9 billion increase in gross profit from sales of petroleum products.  Gross profit from Iron and Steel was ¥125.1 billion, an increase of ¥11.1 billion from ¥114.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia), Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and Sesa Goa Limited (India) recorded increases in gross profit by ¥13.6 billion, ¥3.6 billion and ¥3.4 billion, respectively, due to rising iron ore prices. However, Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) recorded a ¥10.7 billion decrease reflecting a decline in coal prices. The GP ratio from sales of products for the year ended March 31, 2007 was 10.3%, a decline of 0.3 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2006, reflecting relatively lower growth of gross profit (16.4% increase) than that of revenues (20.0% increase). A major part of the growth in revenues was comprised of sales of products in Energy and Chemicals, typically seen as petroleum products at Westport Petroleum, Inc. and petrochemical products at Mitsui, where higher revenues do not necessarily result in increases in gross profit. 81 Table of Contents For the year ended March 31, 2007, gross profit from sales of services was ¥398.3 billion, an increase of ¥16.5 billion from ¥381.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. A ¥6.7 billion increase was seen primarily in Chemicals. Increased revenues from sales of services of Electronics & Information were largely offset by increases in the related costs of those revenues. The typical case was TOYO Officemation, Inc., which provides services of design, operation and maintenance of information systems. The GP ratio from sales of services for the year ended March 31, 2007 was 71.5%, a decrease of 3.0 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2006. This percentage decrease was mainly because operations such as logistics services and information system services, which reported the gross billed amounts as revenues, and therefore, their GP ratios were less than 100% (because of the accompanying cost of revenues), recorded relatively higher increases in revenues, compared to operations such as intermediary services where the net amount of sales and purchase prices in back-to-back transactions were reported as revenues with GP ratios of 100%. For the year ended March 31, 2007, gross profit from other sales was ¥74.6 billion, an increase of ¥8.2 billion from the ¥66.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The major reasons were the same as described in RevenuesOther Sales above. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 For the year ended March 31, 2006, gross profit from sales of products was ¥370.1 billion, an increase of ¥76.8 billion from ¥293.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major factors in this category are as follows:  Gross profit from Energy was ¥90.0 billion, an increase of ¥38.0 billion from the ¥52.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) and Mittwell Energy Resources Pty. Ltd. (Australia) recorded increases reflecting higher oil prices. Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States) also recorded an increase.  Gross profit from Iron and Steel was ¥114.0 billion, an increase of ¥35.5 billion from the ¥78.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia), Sesa Goa Limited (India) and Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) recorded increases in gross profit due to rising iron ore and coal prices. The GP ratio from sales of products for the year ended March 31, 2006 was 10.6%, an improvement of 0.7 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2005. This 0.7 percentage point improvement was because the growth in revenues at our mineral resources and energy development and production subsidiaries reflecting the surge in sales prices outpaced the increase in their costs of revenues. For the year ended March 31, 2006, gross profit from sales of services was ¥381.8 billion, an increase of ¥16.5 billion from ¥365.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major factors in this category classified by product were as follows:  Gross profit from Iron and Steel and Chemicals increased by ¥13.0 billion and ¥9.7 billion, respectively, reflecting increases in revenues from sales of services.  Increases in revenues from sales of services of Machinery and Electronics & Information were largely offset by increases in the related costs of those revenues. The GP ratio from sales of services for the year ended March 31, 2006 was 74.5%, a decrease of 9.7 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2005. As with the trend seen in the comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, logistics services and information system services recorded relatively higher increases in revenues, compared to operations such as intermediary services. 82 Table of Contents For the year ended March 31, 2006, gross profit from other sales was ¥66.4 billion, an increase of ¥16.8 billion from ¥49.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major reasons were the same as described in RevenuesOther Sales above. Gross Profit Classified by Operating Segment For detailed discussion, see Operating Results by Operating Segment. A summary of the increase in gross profit classified by operating segment is provided as below. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, all the operating segments except for All Other recorded increases in gross profit.  The Energy Segment and the Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment recorded ¥27.8 billion and ¥11.5 billion increases, respectively. The Energy Segments increase was primarily attributable to the expanded contribution from oil and gas producing activities, namely Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited (Australia) due to the start-up of commercial production at the Enfield oil project; and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan) as a result of its acquisition. Furthermore, Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) and Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia) reported increases reflecting higher prices of crude oil and iron ore, respectively.  The Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment recorded an increase, primarily reflecting expansion of operations of overseas automotive-related subsidiaries. Business transactions at the Iron & Steel Products Segment and the Chemical Segment continued to show good performance in general.  The Logistics & Financial Markets Segment and the Americas Segment recorded strong results in trading operations in various commodities such as petroleum products trading at Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States).  In the Foods & Retail Segment and the Lifestyle, Consumer Service and Information, Electronics & Telecommunication Segment, performance varied by products and services. Domestic apparel businesses and Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. showed disappointing performance, while real estate businesses performed strongly especially overseas. 83 Table of Contents Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Major factors for a ¥110.1 billion increase in gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 are discussed below:  The Iron & Steel Raw Materials & Non-Ferrous Metals Segment reported a significant increase of ¥36.6 billion from the year ended March 31, 2005. Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and Sesa Goa Limited (India) recorded increases, reflecting a 71.5% iron ore price increase on a pure ore content basis. Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) also recorded a significant increase, reflecting price increases in representative Australian metallurgical coal, which rose by approximately 120%.  In the Chemical Segment, overall market prices of petrochemical products stayed high, reflecting the high crude oil prices, and Mitsuis petrochemicals trading continuously benefited from favorable market conditions following the previous year. Due to higher ammonia prices, PT Kaltim Pasifik Amoniak (Indonesia) reported an increase in gross profit.  The Energy Segment reported an increase, as oil and gas producing subsidiaries including Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) and Mittwell Energy Resources Pty. Ltd. (Australia) benefited from higher crude oil prices. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Classified by Category of Expenses Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2007 were ¥581.5 billion, an increase of ¥31.4 billion, or 5.7%, from ¥550.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006.

Those operations include the automotive related businesses such as P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) and construction machinery related businesses such as Road Machinery, LLC (United States) in the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment; and the domestic information and telecommunication businesses such as TOYO Officemation, Inc. (Japan) and Telepark Corp. (Japan) in the Lifestyle, Consumer Service and Information, Electronics & Telecommunication Segment. Also, performance linked bonuses to traders increased at Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States).  Other remaining items in selling, general and administrative expenses increased showing similar patterns as personnel expenses. 84 Table of Contents Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2006 were ¥550.1 billion, an increase of ¥41.0 billion, or 8.1%, from ¥509.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005.  Personnel expenses were ¥275.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, an increase of ¥25.1 billion from ¥250.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Mitsui & Co. Energy Risk Management Ltd. (United Kingdom) and Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States) reported increases of ¥3.6 billion and ¥3.0 billion, respectively, because of increases in performance linked bonuses to traders. MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. (Japan) recorded an increase of ¥1.9 billion in connection with the establishment of new distribution bases. There were also increases from newly acquired domestic subsidiaries such as NextCom K.K. (Japan). Mitsui reported an increase of ¥4.5 billion principally due to increases in bonuses to employees.  Communication and information expenses were ¥42.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, an increase of ¥4.1 billion from ¥38.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. This increase resulted from the introduction of a new enterprise resource planning system in November 2004.

On the other hand, the Energy Segment and the Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment which reported major increases in gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2007, recorded a ¥0.1 billion increase and a ¥1.3 billion decrease, respectively. 85 Table of Contents In regards to the Energy Segment and the Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment, major portion of gross profit is generated through oil and gas producing or mining activities where selling, general and administrative expenses have quite marginal significance compared to revenues and cost of revenues. Accordingly there is a little correlation between gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses at these two operating segments. The Energy Segment and the Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment have relatively small number of employees compared to other operating segments as seen in Item 6.D. Employees. Personnel expenses have had around 50% of total selling, general and administrative expenses. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 By operating segment, major increases between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 were:  a ¥7.6 billion increase in the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment mainly attributable to the acquisition of NextCom K.K.; and  a ¥7.0 billion and a ¥6.1 billion increase in the Logistics & Financial Markets Segment and the Americas Segment, mainly attributable to the performance linked bonuses at Mitsui & Co. Energy Risk Management Ltd. (United Kingdom) and Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States). Provision for Doubtful Receivables Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Provision for doubtful receivables for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥13.3 billion, an increase of ¥13.3 billion, from less than ¥0.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Major factors were a new provision for an overseas oil exploration company; an increase in the provision for motorcycle retail finance at P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) reflecting its expanding operations; and an increase in the provision at Fertilizantes Mitsui S.A. Industria e comercio (Brazil). A less than ¥0.1 billion provision for the year ended March 31, 2006 was partly attributable to the collection of debts which had been written off as uncollectible in the past. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Provision for doubtful receivables for the year ended March 31, 2006 was minimal, less than ¥0.1 billion, an improvement from ¥8.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major provisions for doubtful receivables in the year ended March 31, 2005 included a provision for a machinery-related domestic customer. Interest Income and Interest Expense Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Interest income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥50.7 billion, an increase of ¥12.4 billion, or 32.4%, from ¥38.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Interest expense was ¥92.5 billion, an increase of ¥33.1 billion, or 55.7%, from ¥59.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. As a result, interest expense, net of interest income, was ¥41.8 billion, an increase of ¥20.7 billion, or 98.1%, from ¥21.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. A breakdown of the principal changes for the year ended March 31, 2007 is as follows:  Interest expense incurred for the Sakhalin II project increased by ¥9.0 billion due to increased interest bearing debt to fund the investments in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda) and higher U.S. dollar interest rates.  Other than the Sakhalin II project related interest expense, Mitsui recorded an increase of ¥3.5 billion in interest expense, reflecting increases in interest bearing debt associated with various investments.  Reflecting higher U.S. dollar interest rates, interest expense at overseas subsidiaries increased by ¥8.3 billion. Especially, the Americas Segment recorded a ¥4.8 billion increase, which was mainly attributable to Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. and Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States). 86 Table of Contents  In general, interest income tends to show the similar patterns of fluctuations as interest expense. We provide loans and deferred payment facility, which generate interest income, by funding our borrowings from financial institutions. Usually, both interest expense and interest income have same interest rate type, floating or fixed. Accordingly, most of fluctuations in interest income are offset by corresponding fluctuations in interest expense. Interest rate trends for the year ended March 31, 2007 regarding Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, the major currencies in which we have borrowings, were as follows:  The Bank of Japan decided to terminate its zero interest rate policy in July 2006, and raised the policy interest rate in February 2007. Reflecting this policy change, the average of the month-end Japanese yen three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the year ended March 31, 2007 rose to 0.45% from 0.07% for the year ended March 31, 2006. The average yield rate on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds was 1.75% for the year ended March 31, 2007, up from 1.44% during the year ended March 31, 2006.  The average of the month-end U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR during the year ended March 31, 2007 was 5.35%, up from the average of 4.12% during the year ended March 31, 2006, reflecting the FRBs policy of raising the Federal Funds target rate from 4.75% as of March 2006 to 5.25% as of June 2006 and keeping the rate level thereafter. Regarding development of our investment plans and financial policies, refer to B. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Interest income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥38.3 billion, an increase of ¥2.8 billion, or 7.9%, from ¥35.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Interest expense was ¥59.4 billion, an increase of ¥16.3 billion, or 37.8%, from ¥43.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. As a result, interest expense, net of interest income was ¥21.1 billion, an increase of ¥13.5 billion, or 177.6%, from ¥7.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005.  At Mitsui Sakhalin Holdings B.V. (Netherlands), interest expense increased by ¥6.7 billion due to an increase in interest bearing debt which was used to fund increasing investments in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda) and an increase in U.S. dollar interest rates.  Mitsui recorded an increase of ¥3.0 billion in interest expense, reflecting increases in interest bearing debt associated with increases in investments.  Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. (United States) recorded an increase of ¥1.9 billion in interest expense, reflecting an increase in U.S. dollar interest rates. Interest rate trends for the year ended March 31, 2006 regarding Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar were as follows:  The average of the month-end Japanese yen three-month LIBOR remained 0.07%, roughly unchanged from the 0.05% during the year ended March 31, 2005, as the Bank of Japan maintained its very low interest rate policy. The average yield rate on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds was 1.44% for the year ended March 31, 2006, slightly declining from 1.52% during the year ended March 31, 2005.  The average of the month-end U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR during the year ended March 31, 2006 was 4.12%, up from the average of 2.13% during the year ended March 31, 2005, reflecting the FRBs policy of gradually raising the Federal Funds target rate to 4.75% in the period from June 2004 to March 2006. 87 Table of Contents Dividend Income Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Dividend income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥50.1 billion, an increase of ¥19.4 billion, or 63.2%, from ¥30.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Dividends from LNG projects in the Middle East, namely Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Oman, totaled ¥26.6 billion, a significant increase of ¥13.2 billion, from ¥13.4 billion the year ended March 31, 2006. The rest of the increase in dividend income was mostly comprised of increases in dividends from domestic listed companies. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Dividend income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥30.7 billion, an increase of ¥6.1 billion, or 24.8%, from ¥24.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Total dividends from the three LNG projects in the Middle East were ¥13.4 billion, a slight increase of ¥0.6 billion from ¥12.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005.

(Japan) shares. Mitsui also record a ¥4.5 billion gain on sale of shares in Telepark Corp. (Japan), a subsidiary engaged in sales of mobile devices and telecommunication lines.  For the year ended March 31, 2006, the Lifestyle, Consumer Service and Information, Electronics & Telecommunication Segment recorded gain on sale of shares in telecommunication related companies, namely, a ¥5.5 billion gain (jointly with the Americas Segment) on the sales of shares in Metro PCS in the United States, a ¥3.3 billion gain from the exchange of shares in POWEREDCOM, Inc. for KDDI CORPORATION in Japan and a ¥2.0 billion gain on the sales of shares in P.T.

(Japan) registered and issued 8,000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering in April 2004. As a result, our ownership interest in Telepark Corp. decreased and Mitsui recognized a ¥1.7 billion gain on issuance of stock by a subsidiary for the year ended March 31, 2005. See Note 19, ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES. Loss on Write-Down of Securities Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 The loss on write-down of securities for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥11.7 billion, an increase of ¥1.1 billion, or 10.4%, from ¥10.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. For the year ended March 31, 2006, the Japanese stock markets saw an upturn following the recovery of the Japanese economy and expanding corporate earnings with the Nikkei Stock Average at ¥17,059.66 as of March 31, 2006, compared to ¥11,668.95 as of March 31, 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2007 the Nikkei Stock Average recorded the low of ¥14,218.60 in June 2006, reflecting appreciation of the yen and a correction phase of global stock markets. However, such pessimistic sentiment faded and the Nikkei Stock Average recovered to ¥17, 287.65 as of March 31, 2007. Reflecting these developments in the stock market, the write-down of marketable securities for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥3.1 billion, a slight increase over ¥1.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. With respect to non-marketable securities, individual write-down losses were insignificant for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 For the year ended March 31, 2006, the loss on write-down of securities was ¥10.6 billion, a decrease of ¥5.9 billion or 35.8%, from ¥16.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2005, the Japanese stock markets experienced repeated minor adjustments within a narrow range between a high of ¥12,163.89 and a low of ¥10,505.05 in the Nikkei Stock Average, due to surging crude oil prices, concern over worldwide inflation, appreciation of the yen and a slowdown in the United States economy while underpinned by hopes for recoveries of domestic and overseas economies and an expansion in corporate earnings. The write-down of marketable securities for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥1.8 billion, a slight increase over ¥0.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2005, considering a deterioration in financial condition due to sluggish advertising revenues, we recorded losses on shares of satellite broadcaster BS-i, INCORPORATED (in Japan, not the same company as BSI Co., Ltd., listed under Gains on Sales of SecuritiesNet) and BS Japan Corporation in Japan of ¥1.9 billion and ¥1.2 billion, respectively.

Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Gain on disposal or sales of property and equipmentnet for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥6.0 billion, a decrease of ¥0.5 billion, or 7.7%, from a ¥6.5 billion gain for the year ended March 31, 2005.

(United States). The above properties sold by Mitsui for the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 had been acquired before the significant land price increases in Japan in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

For more information on impairment losses on long-lived assets, see Note 10, IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, and on our reevaluation and restructuring of subsidiaries, see Note 25, EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES. As of March 31, 2007, we did not identify any material assets analyzed for impairment for which an impairment charge has not yet been recorded. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 The impairment loss on long-lived assets for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥24.3 billion, an increase of ¥10.2 billion or 72.3%, from ¥14.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005.

(Japan) reported a ¥16.5 billion impairment loss on all of its goodwill using a discounted future cash flow method based on its internal operating budget for evaluation of fair value of its goodwill. Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. experienced a downturn in profitability due to the intensifying competition in the tea related materials industry. See Note 12, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. We expect that net income for the year ending March 31, 2008 of Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. will be marginal reflecting continuously strict business conditions. Compensation and Other Charges Related to DPF Incident In November 2004, Mitsui discovered that false data had been produced and submitted to authorities for diesel particulate filters (DPFs) manufactured by Mitsuis subsidiary, PUREarth Incorporated (Japan), and sold by Mitsui. These filters were subsidized by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and seven other prefectural and municipal governments, as well as the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the Ministry of the Environment, and related industry associations. Mitsui had sold approximately 21,500 units of the product. Mitsui carried out a three-part user response plan involving: (1) the free replacement of DPFs, (2) the reimbursement of the amount paid for purchasing Mitsuis DPFs in exchange for their redemption and (3) a support program for the purchase of alternative vehicles, as well as redemption of DPFs. For the year ended March 31, 2005, Mitsui recorded ¥36.0 billion as compensation and other charges related to DPF incident, consisting of a user response charge of approximately ¥28.0 billion and subsidy compensation of approximately ¥8.0 billion. For the year ended March 31, 2006, Mitsui recorded an additional user response charge of ¥9.0 billion, re-estimating expected costs in each user response plan reflecting changes in the requirement of each respective user. Mitsui completed the redemption of DPFs for the year ended March 31, 2007, and consequently Mitsui recorded a credit to income of ¥3.9 billion as a result of the reversal of the accrued cost for compensation and other charges. For more information, see Note 22, COMPENSATION AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO DPF INCIDENT. Other ExpenseNet Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, other expensenet was a ¥7.5 billion expense, an ¥8.1 billion deterioration from ¥0.6 billion in income for the year ended March 31, 2006. For the year ended March 31, 2007, Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and other oil and gas exploration and producing subsidiaries reported a combined sum of ¥3.4 billion in exploration expenses; and a combined sum of ¥3.4 billion in restructuring-related charges were reported mainly by MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. (Japan), Hokushuren Company Limited (Japan) and Mitsui Bussan House-Techno, Inc. (Japan). For the year ended March 31, 2006, other expensesnet consisted of individually small items. For more information on other expensenet, see Note 20, OTHER EXPENSENET, and on our restructuring activities, see Note 25, EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES. 91 Table of Contents Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 For the year ended March 31, 2006, other expensenet was ¥0.6 billion in income, an improvement of ¥7.6 billion from a ¥7.0 billion expense for the year ended March 31, 2005. The main elements of other expensesnet for the year ended March 31, 2005 were ¥2.5 billion in exploration expenses reported by Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and other oil and gas development and production subsidiaries; and ¥2.0 billion in restructuring-related charges. Income Taxes Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, income taxes were ¥159.0 billion, an increase of ¥24.0 billion, or 17.8%, from ¥135.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, reflecting increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interests and equity in earnings. The effective tax rate was 48.2%, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points from 48.5% for the year ended March 31, 2006. For further information, see Note 21, INCOME TAXES. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 For the year ended March 31, 2006, income taxes were ¥135.0 billion, an increase of ¥30.9 billion, or 29.7%, from ¥104.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, reflecting increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interests and equity in earnings. The effective tax rate was 48.5%, a decrease of 10.8 percentage points from 59.3% for the year ended March 31, 2005. This was mainly due to establishing a valuation allowance in a large amount for the year ended March 31, 2005 which was provided on deferred tax assets on the impairment loss of certain of Mitsuis investments recorded in the past years. This factor represented a 10.6 percentage point decline in effective tax rate in the year ended March 31, 2006. Transfer price taxation issue with North West Shelf LNG Project Mitsui was audited by the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau with regard to transfer price taxation in connection with the LNG Project in Western Australia for the period of six fiscal years from the year ended March 31, 2000 to the year ended March 31, 2005. On June 30, 2006, Mitsui received a notice of tax assessment from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau for the one year ended March 31, 2000. Based on the notice of assessment, the taxable income was corrected by ¥4.8 billion and the additional tax liabilities for income taxes were ¥2.4 billion Mitsui has paid the additional taxes and recorded the amount as income taxescurrent. 92 Table of Contents Mitsui disagrees with the assessment and registered its protest in August 2006, and in addition, lodged an application in November 2006 for the mutual agreement procedure pursuant to a provision in the tax treaty between Japan and Australia in order to settle the double taxation. Mitsui believes that it is probable that the double taxation will be avoided by the mutual agreement procedure, and the amount of the correction for the year ended March 31, 2000 and the final correction and tax liabilities for the period from the year ended March 31, 2001 to the year ended March 31, 2005, if any, will be affected by the result of the mutual agreement procedure. Because the mutual agreement procedure has not been agreed yet, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of potential impact on our financial position and results of operations. Accordingly, except for payment based on the received assessment, the amount of potential loss and the related allowance are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2007. In addition, on June 29, 2007, Mitsui received a notice of tax assessment from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau for the one year ended March 31, 2001. According to the notice of tax assessment, the taxable income was corrected by ¥8.2 billion and the additional tax liabilities for the Corporation Tax, Enterprise Tax and Inhabitant Tax, including penalties and interests, are ¥3.8 billion. Minority Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, minority interests in earnings of subsidiaries were ¥26.0 billion, an increase of ¥4.5 billion, or 20.9%, from ¥21.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006.

(Japan) (with a minority interest of 48.1%) recorded a loss from continuing operations before minority interests and equity in earnings, reflecting significant impairment losses on long-lived assets and goodwill, contributing ¥8.3 billion minority interest in income for the year ended March 31, 2007 compared to a ¥0.2 billion loss for the year ended March 31, 2006.

(Australia), due to rising oil prices and increased production from the start-up of the fourth LNG production train in August 2004. Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued OperationsNet (After Income Tax Effect) Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, income (loss) from discontinued operationsnet (after income tax effect) was income of ¥3.3 billion, a ¥16.9 billion improvement from loss of ¥13.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006.  The primary component of discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2007 was Mitalco Inc. (United States) owned jointly by the Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment and 94 Table of Contents the Americas Segment. Mitalco Inc. held a 32% stake in two aluminum smelting facilities in the United States and had mainly been engaged in manufacturing and sale of aluminum. Because of the declining profitability resulting from the deterioration in the terms of the power purchase contract during the course of renewal negotiations, we sold all of our stake in both facilities. The income (loss) from discontinued operation of Mitalco Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were ¥3.1 billion income and ¥14.5 billion loss, respectively.  The primary component of discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2006 was Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. (United Kingdom), a crude oil trading subsidiary reported in the Energy Segment and the Europe Segment. While Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. had been trading physical crude oil as well as future oil and oil derivatives, its expanding activity under booming oil prices exposed us to larger risks, such as market risk, and would require us to invest additional operating resources. As a result of an overall review of the business model of Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. and our business portfolio, we decided to sell all the shares of Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. to a new owner. We sold all shares during the year ended March 31, 2006. The income from discontinued operation of Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. was minimal for the year ended March 31, 2006 and ¥6.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 For the year ended March 31, 2006, income (loss) from discontinued operationsnet (after income tax effect) was loss of ¥13.6 billion, a ¥16.5 billion deterioration from income of ¥2.9 billion recorded for the year ended March 31, 2005.  The primary component of discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2005 was Shirasagi Golf Club Co., Ltd. (Japan), a subsidiary reported in the All Other Segment. Shirasagi Golf Club Co., Ltd. had been engaged in the operation of a membership golf club in Japan, which had reported consecutive losses since the opening of the golf club because both the number of customers and the average sale per customer had declined. In these business conditions, as it was very unlikely that Shirasagi Golf Club Co., Ltd. would be able to improve its earnings and pay off its debts in the future, Mitsui disposed of the operation during the year ended March 31, 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2005, the income from discontinued operation of Shirasagi Golf Club Co., Ltd. was ¥0.7 billion, partially reversing losses in previous years. Operating Results by Operating Segment The business units of Mitsuis Head Office, which are organized based on products and services, plan overall and worldwide strategies for their products and services and conduct their worldwide operations. The business units also collaborate with overseas branches and overseas trading subsidiaries in planning and executing their strategies for products and regions. The overseas branches and overseas trading subsidiaries are separate operating units, which are delegated responsibility for the business of their regions as the centers of each particular regional strategy and operate diversified businesses together with their subsidiaries and associated companies in collaboration with the business units. Therefore, our operating segments consist of product-focused operating segments comprised of the business units of the Head Office and region-focused operating segments comprised of overseas branches and overseas trading subsidiaries. Our operating segments have been aggregated based on the nature of the products and other criteria into eight product-focused reportable operating segments and four region-focused reportable operating segments, totaling twelve reportable operating segments. Beginning the year ended March 31, 2007, Mitsui & Co. Financial Services (Europe) B.V., which was formerly included in Europe, has been transferred to All Other in order to centralize the operation of financial services to the companies and associated companies. 95 Table of Contents The operating segment information for the year ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 has been restated to conform to the current year presentation.

The overall steel products market conditions stayed firm, reflecting tight global supply-demand balance and steady domestic economy. Transactions in high-end products such as steel sheets and plates for automobiles and shipbuilding, steel tubular products and line pipes for oil and gas development especially contributed to the high level of gross profit. Furthermore, rising stainless steel products prices and strong performance at Regency Steel Asia Pte Ltd. (Singapore) contributed to the increase in gross profit. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥25.6 billion, a decrease of ¥0.9 billion from ¥26.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and provision for doubtful receivables outweighed the above-mentioned increase in gross profit. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥3.1 billion, an increase of ¥0.1 billion from ¥3.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥20.6 billion, a ¥1.2 billion increase from ¥19.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Gains on sales of shares in domestic listed companies and dividend income from an overseas steel manufacturer contributed to increases in net income, offsetting the decrease in operating income. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥54.4 billion, an increase of ¥7.1 billion from ¥47.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2006, worldwide demand for steel products in general continued to stay firm. Steel tubular products including oil pipes and high-end steel plates for shipbuilding and automobiles contributed to the increase in gross profit, especially at Mitsui, although we saw weakening market conditions mainly in commodity type steel products arising from excessive supply from China towards the second half of the year ended March 31, 2006. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥26.5 billion, an increase of ¥10.2 billion from ¥16.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, reflecting the above-mentioned increase in gross profit and decrease in the provision for doubtful receivables. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥3.0 billion, an increase of ¥1.3 billion from ¥1.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, due to contributions by domestic companies. Reflecting the above, net income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥19.4 billion, a ¥7.8 billion increase from ¥11.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. 99 Table of Contents Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change(20072006) Change(20062005) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Profit ¥ 122.3 ¥ 110.8 ¥ 74.2 ¥ 11.5 ¥ 36.6 Operating Income 98.7 87.2 51.9 11.5 35.3 Equity in Earnings of Associated Companies 60.4 28.7 20.7 31.7 8.0 Net Income 103.8 54.7 35.4 49.1 19.3 Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥122.3 billion, an increase of ¥11.5 billion from ¥110.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006 as a result of the following:  The International Iron and Steel Institute reported that global crude steel output for 2006 (calendar year) maintained a high level of 1,244 million metric tons, following 1,142 million metric tons for 2005. Reflecting tight supply-demand balance in Asia, especially in China, iron ore prices for the year ended March 31, 2007 rose by 19% from the year ended March 31, 2006 resulting in increases in gross profit at Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia), Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and Sesa Goa Limited (India) by ¥13.7 billion, ¥3.6 billion and ¥3.4 billion, respectively. At Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. and Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd., shipments (on our equity production basis) increased slightly to 21.9 million tons and 2.9 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2007 from 21.8 million tons and 2.5 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2006.  The price for representative Australian metallurgical coal for the year ending March 31, 2007 decreased by approximately 10%. In addition, pressure from surging material and fuel costs resulted in an ¥11.0 billion decline in gross profit at Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) from the year ended March 31, 2006. Prices for representative Australian metallurgical coal declined to U.S.$110 per ton/FOB for the year ended March 31, 2007 from U.S.$125 per ton/FOB for the year ended March 31, 2006. Shipments by Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. increased to 6.7 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2007 from 5.9 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2006 due to improvement of a delay in stripping work caused by a labor and material shortage. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥98.7 billion, an increase of ¥11.5 billion from ¥87.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥60.4 billion, a significant increase of ¥31.7 billion from ¥28.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Major factors were as follows:  Mitsui owns 18.24% of the outstanding voting shares of Valepar S.A. (Brazil), the holding company of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), a Brazilian iron ore and mineral resources company. Supported by higher market prices of their mining products, our equity in earnings of Valepar S.A. was ¥25.0 billion, including a ¥5.6 billion gain on issuance of stock by CVRD in exchange for Caemi Mineração e Metalurgia S.A stock, which was a ¥10.4 billion increase from the year ended March 31, 2006.  Robe River Mining Company Pty. Ltd. (Australia), an iron ore mining company, recorded earnings of ¥12.3 billion, an increase of ¥3.3 billion from the year ended March 31, 2006.  Compania Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi SCM (Chile), a copper mine joint venture, recorded earnings of ¥19.2 billion, an increase of ¥15.5 billion from the year ended March 31, 2006, due to the rise in copper price as well as a tax effect on its retained earnings for the additional Chilean tax charged to 100 Table of Contents dividend recipients which took place in the year ended March 31, 2006. The London Metals Exchange (LME) copper price for 2006 (calendar year) was US$6,731 per ton on average, a significant increase from US$3,684 per ton for 2005 (calendar year). Net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥103.8 billion, a ¥49.1 billion increase from ¥54.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. In addition to improvement in operating income and equity in earnings of associated companies, there were the following components:  This segment recorded a ¥14.2 billion gain on the sale of shares in Toho Titanium Co., Ltd. (Japan) for the year ended March 31, 2007.  For the year ended March 31, 2006, an aluminum smelting subsidiary Mitalco Inc. (United States) recorded an ¥11.8 billion impairment loss on plant facilities and ¥11.5 billion other expenses including impairment on goodwill. However, it recorded a gain on the sale of its stake in aluminum smelters for the year ended March 31, 2007. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥110.8 billion, a significant increase of ¥36.6 billion from ¥74.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The main elements of the increase were as follows:  The International Iron and Steel Institute reported that global crude steel output for 2005 (calendar year) maintained a high level of 1,142 million metric tons, following 1,067 million metric tons for 2004 when it reached the level of 1,000 million metric tons for the first time ever. The Australian iron ore prices under long-term contracts for the year ended March 31, 2006 rose by 71.5% from the year ended March 31, 2005. This resulted in major increases in gross profit at Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia), Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and Sesa Goa Limited (India) of ¥17.9 billion, ¥3.0 billion and ¥5.6 billion, respectively, over the year ended March 31, 2005. At Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. and Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd., shipments (on our equity production basis) increased slightly to 21.8 million tons and 2.5 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2006 from 21.3 million tons and 2.4 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2005.  Similarly, prices for metallurgical coal and thermal coal for the year ended March 31, 2006 rose sharply. Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) recorded a ¥13.8 billion increase in gross profit over the year ended March 31, 2005, in spite of a decline in output volume and increased production cost from surging fuel and material costs. Prices for representative Australian metallurgical coal rose to U.S.$125 per ton/FOB for the year ended March 31, 2006 from U.S.$57 per ton/FOB for the year ended March 31, 2005. Shipments by Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. decreased to 5.9 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2006 from 6.8 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2005 due to a delay in stripping work caused by a labor and material shortage. Consistent with the increase in gross profit, operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥87.2 billion, an increase of ¥35.3 billion from ¥51.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥28.7 billion, an increase of ¥8.0 billion from ¥20.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Major factors were as follows:  Reflecting improved operating results of CVRD, driven by rising mineral resources prices, our equity in earnings of Valepar S.A. for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥14.6 billion, a ¥8.2 billion increase from the year ended March 31, 2005. Robe River Mining Company Pty. Ltd. (Australia) recorded earnings of ¥9.0 billion, an improvement by ¥4.2 billion over the year ended March 31, 2005.  Equity in earnings of Companhia Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi SCM (Chile) was ¥3.7 billion, a ¥4.1 billion decline from the year ended March 31, 2005. In the year ended March 31, 2006, this investee declared dividends, so Mitsui recognized the tax effect on its retained earnings for the additional 101 Table of Contents Chilean tax charged to dividend recipients. This change outweighed the positive effect on its operations from rising copper price. Average LME copper prices rose to U.S.$3,684 per ton/FOB for 2005 (calendar year) from U.S.$2,868 per ton/FOB for 2004 (calendar year). Net income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥54.7 billion, a ¥19.3 billion increase from ¥35.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The significant increase for the year ended March 31, 2006 resulted from the improvement in operating income and equity in earnings of associated companies, while it was partly offset by impairment loss and other expenses at Mitalco Inc. (United States). Short- and Long-Term Outlook on Prices and Supply-Demand Balance for Iron & Steel Raw Materials, and Our Equity Production Short-Term Pricing and Supply-Demand Balance The iron ore and coal (metallurgical coal) production joint venture businesses in Australia and other regions in which we participate with major overseas mineral resources companies conclude supply contracts with Japanese steel manufacturers and major clients in other countries every year. Based on such contracts, sales prices are reviewed and renegotiated each fiscal year. For the year ending March 31, 2008, the annual prices of iron ore and coal are as follows. (Unit prices for iron ore and coal from each mine in production also reflect the difference of respective grades and types.)  For the year ending March 31, 2008, the annual prices of iron ore concluded by major mining houses and worldwide major users rose by 9.5% from the year ended March 31, 2007 on a pure ore content basis. The price level reflected limited production capacities in Australia and Brazil and tightened market supply-demand balance in the face of active global demand for iron and steel raw materials mainly from China.  Prices for representative Australian metallurgical coal declined to around U.S.$92 per ton/FOB for the year ending March 31, 2008, approximately 15.5% down from the year ended March 31, 2007. On the other hand, prices for soft coking coal rose by 9% from the year ended March 31, 2007. The price levels reflected different price trends for each product category. In general, market supply-demand balance for coal had been softened due to increased production in China and expanded production capacity elsewhere in the world, whereas thermal coal market had been tightened, reflecting increased demand in the power industry mainly in China. Fluctuations in iron ore and coal prices directly affect revenues from the equity-based production at our iron ore and coal subsidiaries and associated companies. For the year ending March 31, 2008, the estimated impact on net income in the Statements of Consolidated Income arising from changes in iron ore and coal prices is as follows:  Estimated impact on net income from a change of U.S.$1 per ton in iron ore price: Approximately ¥2.6 billion.  Estimated impact on net income from a change of U.S.$1 per ton in coal price: Approximately ¥0.7 billion. For the year ended March 31, 2007, the equity-based shipments of our overseas subsidiaries and associated companies in shipments amounted to approximately 43 million tons of iron ore and approximately 7 million tons of coal. The above-mentioned effect is calculated based on the assumptions of an estimated increase in production in line with our holdings after the year ended March 31, 2007, and a specific range of foreign exchange rates for yen, the U.S. dollar and other related currencies. In April 2007, we sold all of our stake (51% voting share) in Sesa Goa Limited (India) for U.S.$981 million and recorded a ¥93.2 billion gain on sale of securities. The decrease in iron ore production resulting from the sale of the stake in Sesa Goa Limited is included in the aforementioned assumptions based on which the impact on net income for the year ending March 31, 2008 arising from price changes is calculated. 102 Table of Contents Efforts are being undertaken at each mine to expand production and shipments, but production costs are increasing amid a global trend of rising material and equipment costs as well as utility costs. In natural resource producing countries such as Australia and Brazil, there is a general trend toward currency appreciation in line with growing export of those products, resulting in negative impact on the revenues of our overseas subsidiaries and associated companies. Middle- and Long-Term Price Outlook and Supply-Demand Balance and Trends in Our Equity Production In order to respond to tightening supply-demand balance, major iron ore and coal producers are investing to increase production capacity. As of March 31, 2007, noteworthy developments in iron and steel raw materials projects in which we hold stakes are as follows: (Unless otherwise noted, production amounts represent a 100% basis.)  With respect to iron ore mining joint ventures with the BHP Billiton group, we are expanding to raise the combined iron ore production capacity to 129 million tons per annum from 118 million tons by the year ending March 31, 2008. In addition, the joint ventures have further agreed to an expansion plan to increase annual production capacity to 155 million tons and to start production by 2010. Furthermore, with respect to iron ore mining joint ventures with the Rio Tinto group, we have agreed to a plan to increase port capacity at Cape Lambert in the Pilbara region of Western Australia from nameplate capacity of 55 to 80 million tons per annum by the end of 2008.  With respect to coal mining joint ventures promoted with the Anglo American group, expansion work of the Dawson complex is ongoing to boost annual coal production from the present capacity of 6.5 million tons per annum to 12.7 million tons by the year ending March 31, 2008. Including those we are participating in, most of the iron and steel raw material mining projects have plans for expanding their production capacity. As there are too many uncertainties including demand from China and other emerging countries, it is difficult for our management to draw up definitive forecasts on supply-demand balance and prices at this point in time. Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change(20072006) Change(20062005) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Profit ¥ 108.0 ¥ 90.6 ¥ 82.9 ¥ 17.4 ¥ 7.7 Operating Income 20.9 21.7 21.6 (0.8 ) 0.1 Equity in Earnings of Associated Companies 21.4 14.6 10.0 6.8 4.6 Net Income 33.6 30.6 20.9 3.0 9.7 Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥108.0 billion, an increase of ¥17.4 billion from ¥90.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006.  In machinery business fields, Improvement in gross profit was primarily attributable to a motorcycle retail finance company P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) and automotive-related subsidiaries in the Americas and Europe and overseas construction machinery subsidiaries, as well as ocean vessels and marine project businesses.  In infrastructure projects business fields, gross profit slightly increased due to expanding operations of rolling stock leasing subsidiaries in Europe and the Americas, while there were decreases in executed and completed amounts of various overseas construction projects including power plant projects. 103 Table of Contents Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥20.9 billion, a decrease of ¥0.8 billion from ¥21.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in gross profit related to overseas plant project businesses and a new provision for doubtful receivables for an overseas customer. Operating income of subsidiaries in the machinery business and rolling stock leasing subsidiaries improved in general, although the growth in gross profit was partly offset by the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and provision for doubtful receivables especially to automotive related customers. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥21.4 billion, an increase of ¥6.8 billion from ¥14.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Equity in earnings of overseas power producing businesses recorded an increase of ¥3.9 billion from the year ended March 31, 2006, which was mainly attributable to a strong performance by IPM Eagle LLP (United Kingdom) including contribution from the Saltend Power Plant acquired in the third quarter of the year ended March 31, 2006 and P.T. Paiton Energy (Indonesia). In addition, a newly acquired gas distribution business in Brazil contributed, and overseas associated companies engaged in automotive related business and construction machinery business performed strongly as well. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥33.6 billion, an increase of ¥3.0 billion from ¥30.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, principally due to the increase in equity in earnings, while partly offset by increased interest expense. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥90.6 billion, an increase of ¥7.7 billion from ¥82.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Gross profit increased at P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) and other overseas automotive related operations particularly in the Americas. Also, there was a contribution from a newly acquired construction machinery sales subsidiary, Road Machinery, LLC (United States). Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥21.7 billion, a slight increase of ¥0.1 billion from ¥21.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, because the increase in gross profit was largely offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at the above-mentioned subsidiaries that showed growth in gross profit. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥14.6 billion, an increase of ¥4.6 billion from ¥10.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, mainly due to the contribution of IPM Eagle LLP (United Kingdom), which is engaged in overseas power generation businesses, and strong performance in ship and marine project related businesses. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥30.6 billion, an increase of ¥9.7 billion from ¥20.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, due to the above-mentioned improvements in operating income and equity in earnings of associated companies. Chemical Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change (20072006) Change (20062005) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Profit ¥ 103.1 ¥ 97.8 ¥ 87.1 ¥ 5.3 ¥ 10.7 Operating Income 35.3 34.0 24.5 1.3 9.5 Equity in Earnings of Associated Companies 4.9 3.2 2.5 1.7 0.7 Net Income (Loss) 19.3 12.1 (6.9 ) 7.2 19.0 104 Table of Contents Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, gross profit was ¥103.1 billion, an increase of ¥5.3 billion from ¥97.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The principal developments in this segment were as follows:  In basic petrochemicals fields ranging from basic materials to mid-stream intermediate products, gross profit slightly decreased in aggregate. This segment experienced decline in profit from olefin business under tight supply-demand balance due to significant inflation in material cost, and ammonia business due to reduced trading volume, while profit from methanol, styrene and paraxylene businesses increased supported by tight market conditions.  The liquid crystal related module business continued to be robust and so was plastics including IT related parts and components, and inorganic mineral and raw materials such as salt, titanium oxide and sulfur, reflecting strong demand of those materials especially in Asia.  Gross profit increased by ¥4.0 billion at Novus International, Inc. (United States), a feed additive manufacturing subsidiary, whose profit margin has recovered due to improvement in market prices as well as reduced pressure from raw materials prices coupled by reversal effects of the losses associated with hurricane Katrina, which hit the United States during the year ended March 31, 2006. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥35.3 billion, an increase of ¥1.3 billion from ¥34.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The improvement in gross profit was partly offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and the provision for doubtful receivables including that of Fertilizantes Mitsui S.A. Industria e Comercio (Brazil). Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥4.9 billion, an increase of ¥1.7 billion from ¥3.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, mainly due to the contribution of International Methanol Company (Saudi Arabia), a methanol manufacturer, supported by a favorable market environment. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥19.3 billion, an increase of ¥7.2 billion from ¥12.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. In addition to the increases in operating income and equity in earnings of associated companies, Mitsui recorded a credit to income of ¥3.9 billion as a result of the reversal of the accrued cost which had been set up based on estimated cost for compensation and other charges related to the DPF incident during past years as a result of completion of redemption of the relevant DPFs. Mitsui recorded a ¥9.0 billion user response charge for the year ended March 31, 2006. For more information, see Note 22, COMPENSATION AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO DPF INCIDENT. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥97.8 billion, an increase of ¥10.7 billion from ¥87.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major factors were as follows:  During the year ended March 31, 2006, overall market prices for petrochemical products stayed high, reflecting the high crude oil price. As was the case of the preceding year, Mitsuis petrochemicals trading continued to benefit from favorable market conditions. Following rising natural gas prices in the United States, transactions in ammonia and methanol, both derivatives of natural gas, made steady improvements. An ammonia producing subsidiary, PT Kaltim Pasifik Amoniak (Indonesia), reported increases in gross profit. On the other hand, during the year ended March 31, 2005, there were one-time unrealized losses on certain long-term petrochemical purchase commitments as a result of rising purchase prices that were linked to natural gas prices.  During the year ended March 31, 2006, gross profit declined at Novus International, Inc. (United States) due to rising raw material costs and lower output caused by the hurricanes which hit the United States.  Mitsui increased gross profit from the trading of plastics, electronic materials and crystalline liquid for IT related industries and inorganic raw materials such as salt and sulfur reflecting increasing demand in Asia. 105 Table of Contents Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥34.0 billion, an increase of ¥9.5 billion from ¥24.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, mainly due to the increase in gross profit. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥3.2 billion, a slight increase of ¥0.7 billion from ¥2.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, mainly due to the contribution of International Methanol Company (Saudi Arabia), following its commencement of commercial operation. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥12.1 billion, an improvement of ¥19.0 billion from a ¥6.9 billion net loss for the year ended March 31, 2005. In addition to the above-mentioned improvement in operating income and equity in earnings of associated companies, the major factors were as follows:  Mitsui recorded ¥36.0 billion loss for the year ended March 31, 2005 for compensation and other charges related to the DPF incident. For the year ended March 31, 2006, Mitsui recorded ¥9.0 billion additional user response charges. As of end of June 2006 more than 99% of the DPFs had been redeemed.  For the year ended March 31, 2005, we sold our shares in Bangkok Polyethylene Public Company Limited, a manufacturer of high-density polyethylene in Thailand, which had been jointly owned by the Chemical Segment and the Asia Segment. Of the ¥3.9 billion gain realized in the sale, this segments share came to ¥2.5 billion. Energy Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change (20072006) Change (20062005) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Profit ¥ 112.5 ¥ 84.7 ¥ 72.6 ¥ 27.8 ¥ 12.1 Operating Income 73.9 52.0 35.4 21.9 16.6 Equity in Earnings of Associated Companies 44.3 33.8 24.5 10.5 9.3 Net Income 70.2 40.9 42.8 29.3 (1.9 ) Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year ended March 31, 2007, the crude oil market remained volatile with the average price of crude oil bound for Japan, Japan Crude Cocktail (JCC), recording a high of US$72.06 per barrel in September 2006, and then dropping back to US$55.08 per barrel in February 2007. On average, crude oil prices continued to rise reflecting increased demand along with the expansion of the global economy, geopolitical uncertainty surrounding supply from the Middle East and other oil producing regions, and an influx of speculative money into the futures markets. Average JCC for the year ended March 31, 2007 rose to U.S.$63.58 per barrel from U.S.$55.80 per barrel for the year ended March 31, 2006. Average JCC for calendar year 2006 was U.S.$64.08 compared to U.S.$51.11 for calendar year 2005. We observe that the JCC price trend is generally reflected in the net income of our overseas oil and gas producing subsidiaries and associated companies in this segment within a 0 to 6 month time lag. Considering these time lags, Mitsui periodically calculates the weighted average JCC price applied to operating results of those oil and gas producing subsidiaries and associated companies for internal reviewing purposes. Such weighted average JCC prices for internal reviewing purposes for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were U.S.$64 per barrel and U.S.$50 per barrel, respectively. 106 Table of Contents Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥112.5 billion, an increase of ¥27.8 billion from ¥84.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006 primarily due to the following:  There were new contributions of ¥16.4 billion by Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd (Australia) due to the start-up of oil production at the Enfield oil field in July 2006(*) and ¥2.1 billion by MitEnergy Upstream LLC (United States) which acquired oil and gas interests in the Gulf of Mexico from Pogo Producing Company. Rising crude oil prices resulted in an increase in gross profit of overseas subsidiaries engaged in the development and production of oil and gas, including a ¥5.3 billion increase at Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) operating in Oman.  As a result of Mitsuis acquisition of additional voting shares in Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., a production company of gas and crude oil mainly in offshore Thailand, during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., formerly an associated company, became a subsidiary in which Mitsui has 50.3% voting interest. There was a new contribution from Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. of ¥15.1 billion.  In November 2006, it was found that one of the traders at Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) had incurred, but concealed by deceptively reporting, significant unrealized losses on physical and future trading of naphtha. Primarily because accumulated losses realized through orderly liquidation of the relevant transactions amounted to ¥9.6 billion, gross profit at Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. declined by ¥10.1 billion from the year ended March 31, 2006. Total contribution of oil products trading in this segment, with the exception of Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd., for the year ended March 31, 2007 was almost at the same level as the year ended March 31, 2006.  Mitsui Oil Co., Ltd. (Japan), a domestic petroleum products wholesale and retail subsidiary, recorded an increase of ¥3.0 billion due to its success in raising the sales prices of products and subsequent decline in costs reflecting the fall in crude oil prices after summer 2006. On the other hand, Mitsui Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan) recorded decreases in gross profit of ¥2.2 billion affected by reduced margin of its products. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥73.9 billion, an increase of ¥21.9 billion from ¥52.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The increase in gross profit was partly offset by a provision for doubtful receivables for an overseas oil exploration company. Reflecting higher crude oil prices, equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥44.3 billion, an increase of ¥10.5 billion from ¥33.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The increase was mainly attributable to Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. (Australia), which is involved in natural gas, crude oil and condensate exploration, development and marketing in Western Australia. In addition, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. recorded earnings of ¥8.4 billion, an increase of ¥2.5 billion from the year ended March 31, 2006, despite being classified as an associated company for only nine months up to the third quarter for this fiscal year. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥70.2 billion, a significant increase of ¥29.3 billion from ¥40.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Other than the increases in operating income and equity in earnings, there were the following factors:  Interest expense related to the Sakhalin II project increased by ¥9.0 billion as a result of an increase in interest bearing debt which was used to fund the increasing investments in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda) and an increase in the U.S. dollar interest rates.  Dividends from LNG projects in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Oman were ¥26.6 billion, an increase of ¥13.2 billion over the year ended March 31, 2006. * There is a 3 month time lag between the operating results of Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd with its fiscal year end in December and its reflection into our consolidated operating results. Namely, ¥16.4 billion gross profit of Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd represents the performance for six months. 107 Table of Contents  This segment significantly increased repatriation of undistributed earnings from overseas subsidiaries and associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006. The increased dividends received from those overseas entities resulted in a significant increase in Japanese income tax expenses in this segment for the year ended March 31, 2006. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 For the year ended March 31, 2006, crude oil prices continued to rise reflecting increased demand along with the expansion of the global economy. Average JCC for the year ended March 31, 2006 rose significantly to U.S.$55.80 per barrel from U.S.$38.77 per barrel for the year ended March 31, 2005. Average JCC for calendar year 2005 was U.S.$51.11 compared to U.S.$36.37 for calendar year 2004. The weighted average JCC prices (considering a 0 to 6 month time lag on the segments net income) for internal reviewing purposes for the year ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 were U.S.$50 per barrel and U.S.$36 per barrel, respectively. Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥84.7 billion, an increase of ¥12.1 billion from ¥72.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005 mainly due to the following factors:  Among overseas subsidiaries engaged in the development, production and sale of oil and gas, Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) increased gross profit by ¥10.9 billion, reflecting the rise in oil prices. Mittwell Energy Resources Pty., Ltd. (Australia), which sells crude oil and condensate, also recorded an increase of ¥6.9 billion.  Mitsui sold all of the shares in Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. (United Kingdom) during the year ended March 31, 2006. This resulted in a ¥12.3 billion decrease in gross profit from the year ended March 31, 2005, as Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. recorded an outstanding performance in crude oil trading for the year ended March 31, 2005. On the other hand, Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) and Mitsui Oil (Asia) Hong Kong Ltd. (Hong Kong, China) recorded increases in gross profit for oil products trading of ¥2.7 billion and ¥1.9 billion, respectively, reflecting the strong demand in Asia and higher crude oil prices.  As for domestic petroleum products and gas wholesale and retail subsidiaries, Mitsui Oil Co., Ltd. (Japan) and Mitsui Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan), recorded decreases in gross profit of ¥2.0 billion in total because of rising costs caused by the higher crude oil prices. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥52.0 billion, an increase of ¥16.6 billion from ¥35.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, reflecting the above-mentioned increase in gross profit. In addition, for the year ended March 31, 2006, there was a collection of an account receivable which had been previously written off, for more than previously estimated as collectible. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥33.8 billion, an increase by ¥9.3 billion from ¥24.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major factors were as below:  Earnings increased significantly at Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. (Australia) due to rising oil prices and increased production on the back of start-up of the fourth LNG production train in August 2004.  Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan) also recorded an increase in earnings to ¥5.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006 from ¥2.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, mainly due to rising crude oil prices.  Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda) increased earnings due to the rising crude oil price. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥40.9 billion, a decrease by ¥1.9 billion from ¥42.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. Besides increases in operating income and equity in earnings of 108 Table of Contents associated companies, dividend income from our three LNG projects in the Middle East remained at a continuously high level of ¥13.4 billion, a ¥0.6 billion increase over the year ended March 31, 2005. However, these positive factors were more than offset by the following factors:  For the year ended March 31, 2006, increased dividends received from overseas subsidiaries and associated companies resulted in a large increase in income tax expenses at Mitsui.  Interest expenses at Mitsui Sakhalin Holdings B.V. (Netherlands) increased by ¥6.7 billion due to the rise in U.S. dollar interest rates and the increase in interest bearing debt to finance the investment in the Sakhalin II project. Short- and Long-Term Outlook on Prices and Supply-Demand Balance for Energy, and Our Equity Production Short-Term Pricing and Supply-Demand Balance A survey conducted by the International Energy Agency (May 2007) indicated that world crude oil demand in 2006 was 84.2 million barrels per day, with an estimated demand for 2007 of 85.7 million barrels per day. As of June 2007, general observations on short-term supply-demand balance of crude oil by agencies and corporations in this industry suggest that:  Robust global economic growth will continue to support oil demand, however, considering strong expectations for increasing output by non-Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and spare capacity amongst OPEC countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, it will be less likely that spot crude oil supply-demand will be extremely tightened. Meanwhile, productions for certain grades of crude oil are not at satisfactory levels to meet demand, so we may see tight or surplus market conditions by respective grades.  The oil market can be significantly influenced by growing geopolitical uncertainties over such countries as Iran, Nigeria and Iraq, concerns about shortage in gasoline supply in the United States, and other accidental events such as hurricane damage and troubles at refineries. Our production of oil and gas for the year ended March 31, 2006 was about 32 million barrels (gas is converted to barrels of oil at the ratio of 5,800 cubic feet of natural gas to 1 barrel of crude oil), as presented in Table 4, Proved Reserve Quantity Information of Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited). Our production amount for the year ended March 31, 2007 is 52 million barrels, an increase of 20 million barrels from the year ended March 31, 2006. Major factors include the July 2006 start-up of production from the Enfield crude oil project. Our production amount for the year ended March 31, 2008 will further increase due to full-year contribution from this project. In addition, the acquisition of Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. up to Mitsuis 50.3% voting interest contributed to the increase in our annual production for the year ended March 31, 2007. The Enfield crude oil project which has a design production capacity at 100,000 barrels per day commenced production in July 2006, ahead of schedule, and achieved production of 74,000 barrels per day in September. In October, however, one of the major production wells was shut-in due to unexpected sand production and early water breakthrough. The actual production level has been lower than expected. In February 2007, after the geological reservoir model was restudied and updated in line with production history, Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd (Australia) together with the joint venture partner and operator Woodside Energy Ltd. agreed on a budget including additional expenditures of approximately US$390 million for drilling of additional wells and work-over of existing wells in order to increase production from the Enfield crude oil project. Following the completion of the work-over, the average production rate for 2007 is expected to be 45,000 to 55,000 barrels per day. 109 Table of Contents For the year ending March 31, 2008, a change of U.S.$1 per barrel in crude oil prices is expected to have an effect of ¥1.8 billion on net income in the Statements of Consolidated Income as a result of changes in revenues of our oil and gas related subsidiaries and associated companies. Similar to the discussion regarding iron and steel raw materials, actual results of operations are also influenced by production costs, trends in foreign exchange rates and other factors surrounding those subsidiaries and associated companies. Middle- and Long-Term Price Outlook and Supply-Demand Balance and Trends in Our Equity Production The middle- and long-term trends in supply, demand, and prices of crude oil are subject to far greater levels of uncertainty than trends in the short-term, and it is therefore difficult for management to make a definitive forecast. On the other hand, with respect to LNG, we are focusing on the changes in market structure that are currently taking place, and acting accordingly as follows:  In the past, the market has grown mainly with long-term purchase contracts by power and gas companies operating in Japan and the Far East. Expansion of incumbent projects and green field projects coming on stream will increase the volume of supply to the market, while demand, which has traditionally centered around the Far East, will be joined by growing demand from Europe and the United States, while huge markets in China and India will emerge. Therefore, globalization both in terms of supply and demand is expected to progress. In addition, as the opportunity for supply-demand adjustments in these markets increases, LNG is expected to become a more marketable commodity.  Long-term purchase contracts with Japanese companies in many projects are expected to come due for renewal around 2010, and more flexible terms reflecting the above-mentioned supply-demand balance trends will be requested from the buyers. In evaluating the opportunities for the expansion of incumbent projects or participation in green field projects, we are putting an emphasis on securing stable supply as well as diversifying our source of supply to enhance flexibility. The total required funds for the phase II development of the Sakhalin II project are now estimated at U.S.$20 billion, double the original budget of U.S.$10 billion, due to increased expenses related to changes in facility design and construction delays as well as the rising procurement costs of labor and materials. In April 2007, the Amended Development Budget was approved by the Supervisory Board, a special committee which consists of the representatives of the Russian Federation, Sakhalin Oblast, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda) and its shareholders. In April 2007, in addition, the revised Environmental Action Plan was approved by the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation. Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. has been making every effort to achieve the earliest possible start of LNG shipments, which is now scheduled in the second half of 2008, and to contain costs. In February 2007, Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. committed to purchasing additional volume, with which overall sales of Sakhalin II LNG has been substantially completed. On April 18, 2007, Mitsui, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Mitsubishi Corporation signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with OAO Gazprom to trigger the transfer of shares in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. This transaction implemented a protocol signed on December 21, 2006 in Moscow. Under the terms of the protocol, OAO Gazprom acquired a 50% stake plus one share in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. for a total cash purchase price of U.S.$7.45 billion, of which U.S.$18.625 billion was our portion. OAO Gazprom now holds 50% plus one share, Royal Dutch Shell plc 27.5% minus one share, Mitsui 12.5% and Mitsubishi Corporation 10%. OAO Gazprom and the other three shareholders agreed that they will do their best to complete the project on schedule allowing LNG to be delivered to existing customers in Japan, Korea and the North American West Coast. They also entered into an Area of Mutual Interest arrangement, which will cover both future Sakhalin oil and gas exploration and production opportunities, and the building of Sakhalin II into a regional oil and LNG hub. 110 Table of Contents Foods & Retail Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change (20072006) Change (20062005) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Profit ¥ 81.3 ¥ 79.9 ¥ 85.3 ¥ 1.4 ¥ (5.4 ) Operating Income 10.9 9.1 17.8 1.8 (8.7 ) Equity in Earnings of Associated Companies 3.8 3.5 2.2 0.3 1.3 Net Income (Loss) (12.3 ) (3.2 ) 10.6 (9.1 ) (13.8 ) Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥81.3 billion, an increase of ¥1.4 billion from ¥79.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The major factors were as follows:  Gross profit of MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. (Japan) decreased by ¥1.1 billion, primarily reflecting the termination of business relations with The Daiei, Inc, a Japanese national retailer.  Gross profit of Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) decreased by ¥2.9 billion due to poor performance in beverage and beverage materials businesses and divestiture of non-core businesses.  Gross profit of Hokushuren Company Limited (Japan) increased by ¥3.1 billion. There was a full year contribution from Hokushuren Company Limited which was acquired in the second quarter of the year ended March 31, 2006. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥10.9 billion, an increase of ¥1.8 billion from ¥9.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. In addition to improvement in gross profit, there was a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Among others, a ¥3.2 billion reduction was reported by MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. reflecting decreased personnel expenses and depreciation costs. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥3.8 billion, a ¥0.3 billion increase from ¥3.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The segment recorded net loss of ¥12.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, a ¥9.1 billion deterioration from ¥3.2 billion net loss for the year ended March 31, 2006. This decline was mainly attributable to the following reasons:  Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. recorded impairment losses on intangible assets and goodwill of ¥12.1 billion and ¥16.5 billion, respectively, and moreover established valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At the same time, an ¥8.3 billion minority interest in these losses was also recorded.  For the year ended March 31, 2006, MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. recorded ¥6.0 billion impairment losses on land and distribution facilities which became idle as a result of the reorganization of distribution bases. For the year ended March 31, 2007, it reported further ¥2.2 billion impairment losses of long-lived assets and ¥1.4 billion other expenses incurred from its business reorganization. In addition Hokushuren Company Limited reported the sum of ¥1.4 billion impairment losses of long-lived assets and other expenses. In April 2006, MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. and Mitsui reached an agreement with KOKUBU & CO., LTD., a Japanese food wholesaler, in principle to form a business alliance. It includes KOKUBUs support and guidance for the management and operations of MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. in order to reinforce the business functions of MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. and improve efficiency in its distribution logistics. In April 2007, KOKUBU & CO., LTD. and Mitsui reached an agreement where MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. shall transfer a major part of the businesses of its Hokkaido Branch to Hokushuren Company Limited and Mitsui shall transfer 111 Table of Contents 70% of its stake in Hokushuren Company Limited to KOKUBU & CO., LTD. Furthermore, MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. has decided a restructuring plan which is focused on integration of distribution bases and review of cost efficiency in areas other than Hokkaido. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥79.9 billion, a ¥5.4 billion decrease from ¥85.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major factors for this decline, in spite of the contribution from a newly acquired subsidiary Hokushuren Company Limited (Japan) were as follows:  For the year ended March 31, 2006, gross profit decreased at Mitsui in the beverage businesses, from the year ended March 31, 2005 when those businesses showed strong performance due to a summer heat wave in 2004. Transactions also decreased in marine products and cheese businesses.  Gross profit of Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) decreased by ¥2.0 billion due to a decline in sales of catechin, a substance in tea.  Gross profit of MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. (Japan) decreased by ¥1.7 billion, principally attributable to the termination of business relations with The Daiei, Inc. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥9.1 billion, a decrease of ¥8.7 billion from ¥17.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. In addition to the above-mentioned decrease in gross profit, this was due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Hokushuren Company Limited and an increase in personnel expenses at MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. in connection with the establishment of new distribution bases. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥3.5 billion, a ¥1.3 billion increase from ¥2.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. This was primarily due to the contribution from Ventura Foods LLC (United States), a processed oil foods manufacturer, reflecting improvement in raw material costs. This segment recorded net loss of ¥3.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006, a ¥13.8 billion deterioration from ¥10.6 billion net income for the year ended March 31, 2005. This downturn was attributable to the above-mentioned decrease in operating income.

Lifestyle, Consumer Service and Information, Electronics & Telecommunication Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change (20072006) Change (20062005) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Profit ¥ 130.0 ¥ 128.4 ¥ 121.7 ¥ 1.6 ¥ 6.7 Operating Income 20.3 25.0 24.0 (4.7 ) 1.0 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Associated Companies 8.7 3.5 (0.3 ) 5.2 3.8 Net Income 16.6 17.5 11.8 (0.9 ) 5.7 112 Table of Contents Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥130.0 billion, an increase of ¥1.6 billion from ¥128.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. In the lifestyle business fields, the brand apparel business showed disappointing results. On the other hand, in consumer service business fields, gross profit increased in the overseas real estate businesses. In IT related business fields, gross profit slightly increased mainly due to increase of mobile phone sales at Telepark Corp. (Japan) and expansion of outsourcing business at Toyo Officemation Inc. (Japan). Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥20.3 billion, a decrease of ¥4.7 billion from ¥25.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. The improvement in gross profit was outweighed by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily at IT related business operations. Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥8.7 billion, an increase of ¥5.2 billion from ¥3.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. A television shopping service company, QVC JAPAN, INC. (Japan), continued good performance and a mobile phone sales company, Brightstar Logistics Pty. (Australia), also contributed to this improvement. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥16.6 billion, a decrease of ¥0.9 billion from ¥17.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006. Major reasons other than the above-mentioned factors were as follows:  Mitsui Bussan House-Techno, Inc. (Japan), which discontinued housing business during the year ended March 31, 2007, recorded estimated costs of ¥5.3 billion to meet future requirement for product warranties and maintenance services. At the same time, it recorded reversal of valuation allowance for deferred tax assets on its retained loss.  There was a ¥6.1 billion reduction in gain on sales of securities. For the year ended March 31, 2006, there were gains on sales of shares in Metro PCS, Inc. in the United States, KDDI CORPORATION in Japan and PT Excelcomindo Pratama, Tbk in Indonesia amounting to ¥3.5 billion, ¥3.3 billion and ¥2.0 billion, respectively.

Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥128.4 billion, a ¥6.7 billion increase from ¥121.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The major factors for this increase were as follows:  In IT related business fields, gross profit rose at Telepark Corp. (Japan). There were also contributions from NextCom K.K. (Japan) which became a subsidiary in the third quarter of the year ended March 31, 2005.  In lifestyle business fields, gross profit decreased due to withdrawal from cement businesses and overall poor performance in textile businesses.  In consumer service business fields, Mitsui Bussan House-Techno, Inc. (Japan) recorded a decline due to decreased sales of houses built for sale. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥25.0 billion, an increase of ¥1.0 billion from ¥24.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005. The above-mentioned improvement in gross profit was partly offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and provision for doubtful receivables at Mitsui Bussan Forestry Co., Ltd. (Japan). 113 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥3.5 billion, a ¥3.8 billion improvement from the ¥0.3 billion loss for the year ended March 31, 2005. A television shopping service company, QVC JAPAN, INC. (Japan), and a food catering service company, AIM Services Co., Ltd. (Japan), contributed to this improvement, while there were losses at telecommunication related associated companies in Colombia due to provision for doubtful receivables for the year ended March 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was ¥17.5 billion, a ¥5.7 billion increase from ¥11.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005 principally due to the improvement in the above-mentioned operating income and equity in earnings. Other major factors were as follows:  Gains on sales of securities decreased ¥3.4 billion from the year ended March 31, 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates are considered to be critical if they are important to our financial condition and results of operations and involve estimates that require managements subjective or significant judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies including the critical accounting policies discussed below, please see Note 2, BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates that are based on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions. The following items require significant management judgments and estimates. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The amount of impairment losses of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and the balance of the long-lived assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, as of the end of March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Billions of Yen As of March 31, 2007 2006 2005 Long-lived assets ¥ 1,304.5 ¥ 1,019.9 ¥ 906.3 Impairment loss 17.8 24.3 14.1 Impairment losses of long-lived assets had a material impact on our net income for recent years. These losses were mainly due to the declining profitability resulting from deterioration of business environment and the reorganization of business structure and distribution bases owned by our subsidiaries. See Impairment Loss of Long-Lived Assets line-by-line explanation in RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information. The major component of impairment losses for the year ended March 31, 2007 was a loss on intangible assets at Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) due to deterioration of operating environment such as intensifying competition in both beverage and beverage materials. Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. used a discounted future cash flow method based on its internal budget for evaluation of fair value of the intangible assets. We recognize that the estimation and assumption for this impairment loss has been specific to Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd., and we do not expect such estimation and assumption to have a material impact on our future operating results other than those of Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. Our long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of other than by sale are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. This review is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the aggregate amount of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows (impairment analysis). If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the aggregate amount of undiscounted future cash flows, then the asset is considered impaired, and an impairment loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the asset is calculated as present value of the future cash flows that are expected from the asset. 119 Table of Contents Cash flow projections used in our impairment analysis and fair value calculations are based on the business plan authorized by our management or, if this is not available, on the operating plan reflecting the most recent condition of the long-lived asset. In these plans, we assume, for example, that the most recent selling prices of the real estate in the surrounding areas will reasonably continue in the future, and estimate the sales prices of the products from facilities and equipment for the certain future period based on the average price of the equivalent length of period in the past or on the analysts reports. As for the discount rate used in fair value calculations, when expected variations of cash flows are not considered in the cash flow estimate, a discount rate which includes the risk factor for the cash flow deviation, is used. Assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value are incorporated in the discount rate when such information is available. When such information is not available, an expected internal rate of return used for management purpose or a weighted average cost of capital of a company that owns the long-lived asset, whichever is higher, is also considered for the discounted cash flow calculation. Factors to be considered when estimating future cash flows and determining discount rates vary for each long-lived asset because of the difference in nature of the assets and in operating circumstances, such as location, owner, operator, profitability and other factors. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and the determination of discount rates and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of those long-lived assets. Allowance for Doubtful Receivables Since we are a general trading company, trade receivables represent a large portion of our total assets, and therefore, the accounting estimates used to establish an allowance for doubtful receivables are critical. When we deem it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts that are contractually due to us for certain large loan receivables, the specific loan is reviewed for impairment. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include length of period overdue, financial condition of the debtor, requests for debt restructuring and fillings for bankruptcy. An impairment loss for a specific loan deemed to be impaired, as specifically determined under SFAS No.114 and amended by SFAS No. 118, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loanan amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15, is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The expected cash flows from assets and liabilities of the debtor and the fair value of collateral are determined mainly based on an evaluation of independent real estate appraisers, publicly available indication of the real estate price, market price of financial assets and liabilities, guarantors financial condition and other factors. The recoverable amounts are reviewed on a quarterly basis and if necessary, an additional allowance is established. See Note 7, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, for impaired loan amounts and the respective allowance amounts. In addition to the above, an allowance for doubtful receivables is recognized for probable losses inherent in receivables not specifically deemed to be impaired. The amount of allowance is the amount judged to be adequate based primarily on our credit loss experiences and an evaluation of potential losses on the receivables, considering various factors, including current economic condition and financial condition of the debtors. We review the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful receivables by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value over the applicable collateral value. A receivable with an estimated collateral value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable default rate is determined by a customers credit rating that is identified for each customer based on our financial analysis. The default rate of each credit rating is determined based on our historical experiences. 120 Table of Contents Management believes that the estimates of the future cash flows, the fair value of collateral, the credit rating of customers and the corresponding default rate are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value of the collateral, due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions, or drastic increases in default rates based on negative changes in economic condition could negatively affect the valuations of related receivables. Impairment of Investment Securities An impairment of investment securities is charged to earnings when a decline in fair value below cost is deemed to be other than temporary. The impairment of investment equity securities charged to earnings for recent fiscal years had a significant impact on our income. The following table shows the cost of marketable and non-marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and the impairment loss for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Billions of Yen Year ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 Cost Impairmentloss Cost Impairmentloss Cost Impairmentloss Marketable equity securities ¥ 396.0 ¥ 3.1 ¥ 275.3 ¥ 1.8 ¥ 191.0 ¥ 0.6 Non-marketable equity securities 316.2 8.6 249.0 8.8 214.1 15.9 Total ¥ 712.2 ¥ 11.7 ¥ 524.3 ¥ 10.6 ¥ 405.1 ¥ 16.5 Management principally recognizes that a 50% or more decline in fair value of a security leads to the conclusion that the security has an other-than-temporary impairment. If the decline is less than 50%, various factors, such as the extent to which the cost exceeds the market value, the duration of the market decline, our intention and ability to hold the investment until its market price recovery and the financial conditions of the investee, are considered in concluding if the decline is temporary or not. As of March 31, 2007, there was no individual marketable security that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for one year or more. The aggregate unrealized loss amount of the marketable securities (approximately 25 issuers) that had been in continuous unrealized loss positions for less than one year and had severity of decline of fair value below cost ranging from 3% to 21% was ¥0.6 billion. But, considering the combination of length of time that fair values have been below cost, the extent of decline and the financial condition of the investees, we expect that their fair values will recover above their costs while we hold these investments. For non-marketable securities, fair value of an investment is generally determined based on our equity in a net amount of the fair value of investees assets and liabilities. In addition, where future business plans formally adopted by management of the entities are available and when deemed appropriate, discounted future cash flow method is used to determine the fair value of the non-marketable equity securities. The discount rate reflects risk factors for the cash flow deviation from the future business plans and assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value when the information is available and appropriate. However, there are investments that are not evaluated for impairment because no event or change in circumstances that may have had a significant adverse effect on the fair value was identified. See Note 5, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, for further discussion. Management believes that the criteria for evaluating the significance of the decline in fair value are reasonable and that as long as the economic conditions continue to improve, the amount of impairment losses in investment securities will continue to decrease in the near future. However, changes in the securities market or circumstances of each individual investment due to unforeseen changes in economic and business conditions could affect the valuation of the investment securities. 121 Table of Contents Pension Benefit Costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions, including discount, retirement, and mortality rates, which are based on current statistical data, as well as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the difference between actual results and the assumptions is accumulated and amortized to expenses over future periods and, therefore, generally affects the recognized costs in future periods. Management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our future pension costs and obligations. We determine the discount rates each year as of the measurement date, based on a review of interest rates associated with long-term Japanese government bonds or high-quality fixed-income corporate bonds. The discount rates determined on each measurement date are used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date, and are also used to calculate the net periodic pension costs for the upcoming plan year. Mitsui determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets based on the weighted-average rate of return computed by using the expected long-term rate of return on each asset class, which is derived from an extensive study conducted by investment advisors and actuaries on a periodic basis, and the target allocations for each asset class. The study includes a review of anticipated future performance with market analysis of individual asset classes, and also gives appropriate consideration to actual historical returns achieved by the plans. The subsidiaries determine the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets mainly based on the expectations for future returns by investment advisors and actuaries. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions for Mitsuis pension plans: Billions of Yen Impact of change inassumption on NPPCfor the year endingMarch 31, 2008 Impact of change inassumption on PBOas of March 31, 2007 50 basis point decrease in discount rate ¥ (0.1 ) ¥ 15.6 50 basis point increase in discount rate 0.3 (14.6 ) 50 basis point decrease in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 1.3  50 basis point increase in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (1.3 )  See Note 14, PENSION COSTS AND SEVERANCE INDEMNITIES, for further discussion about the estimates and assumptions on PBO and NPPC. Tax Asset Valuation We classify subsidiaries and associated companies into the following five categories and evaluate realizability of deferred tax assets by each category. The valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is established for the amount determined to be unrealizable. First category The companies, which constantly generate sufficient taxable income every year to cover all the future deductible temporary differences as of the end of each fiscal year, and no significant change exists or is expected in the business environment. For this category, we view all deferred tax asset amounts as realizable. Second category The companies with stable operating results in the past years (approximately in the last three years), but do not generate sufficient taxable income in the current year to cover all the future deductible temporary differences as of the end of the fiscal year. For this category, the portion of the deferred tax assets that is recoverable based on an analysis of the scheduled taxable income in the future is determined to be realizable. 122 Table of Contents Third category The companies with unstable operating results in the past years, and do not generate sufficient taxable income in the current year to cover all the future deductible temporary differences as of the end of the fiscal year. For this category, the portion of the deferred tax assets that is recoverable based on an analysis of the scheduled taxable income within a reasonable estimation period is determined to be realizable. Fourth category The companies, which have significant amounts of tax loss carryforwards at the end of the fiscal year, have experienced the expiration of a significant amount of tax loss carryforwards in the past three years, or will fail to utilize a significant amount of tax loss carryforward up to the expiration date in the current period. For this category, the portion of the deferred tax assets that is recoverable with a high degree of certainty based on an analysis of the scheduled taxable income within the next fiscal year is determined to be realizable. If the tax loss carryforward results from a non-recurring and unusual event such as a significant restructuring of the business or a change in law or regulation, and the companies otherwise consistently generate taxable income, the portion of the deferred tax assets that is recoverable based on an analysis of the scheduled taxable income within a reasonable estimation period is determined to be realizable. Fifth category The companies, which recorded a significant amount of tax loss carryforwards for each of the past three years and are expected to record a significant tax loss in the current year as well. For this category, no deferred tax assets are determined to be realizable. For Mitsui, the realizability of deferred tax assets is determined based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, including all currently available information regarding tax deductibility on future years and ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforward. Management believes it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, will be realized. However, the amount of realizable net deferred tax assets may change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are changed or if statutory tax rates are changed. See Note 21, INCOME TAXES, for further discussion about the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance. New Accounting Standards Employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and the recognition of changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 158 also requires an entity to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of an entitys year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. During the year ended March 31, 2007, we adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of this statement. See Note 14, PENSION COSTS AND SEVERANCE INDEMNITIES for the effect of adoption of these provisions. The measurement date provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The effect of adoption of these provisions on our financial position and results of operations will be immaterial. 123 Table of Contents Accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrumentsan amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. One of the amendments to SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140 is that SFAS No. 155 permits an entity to elect fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument in its entirety with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, in which the hybrid financial instrument contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The effect of adoption of this statement on our financial position and results of operations will be immaterial. Accounting for servicing of financial assets In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assetsan amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS No. 156 requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable, and permits an entity to choose either the amortization method or the fair value measurement method for subsequent measurement of each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The effect of adoption of this statement on our financial position and results of operations will be immaterial. Fair value measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim period within those fiscal years. The effect of adoption of this statement on our financial position and results of operations will be immaterial. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of all tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The effect of adoption of this interpretation on our financial position and results of operations is expected to be immaterial. 124 Table of Contents Fair value option In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value. An entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The effect of adoption of this statement on our financial position and results of operations is not currently known and cannot be reasonably estimated until further analysis is completed. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are defined in the SEC regulations as financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio We refer to Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Net DER) in this Liquidity and Capital Resources and elsewhere in this annual report. Net DER is comprised of net interest bearing debt divided by shareholders equity. Net interest bearing debt is defined as adjusted interest bearing debt, defined below, less cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. Our interest bearing debt primarily consists of long-term debt. As discussed in Funding and Treasury Policies and Objectives, to flexibly meet capital requirements and to prepare for future debt-service requirements in case of unforeseen deteriorations in financial markets, currently we hold a relatively high level of cash and cash equivalents reflecting the current financial market conditions and future capital requirements. Under this policy, Net DER is a useful internal measure for our management to review the balance between:  our capacity to meet debt repayments; and  leverage to improve return on equity in our capital structure. To calculate our adjusted interest bearing debt, the followings balances are excluded:  capital lease obligations; and  SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustment. Management therefore believes that using Net DER is useful for the readers especially when comparing it with the same analysis done by other general trading companies. Elimination of the SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustment is made because Japanese investors usually evaluate Net DER of other general trading companies in this manner. This calculation does not recognize the fact that cash and cash equivalents and time deposits may not be completely available for debt repayments because some amount of cash and cash equivalents and time deposits may be required for operational needs including contractual obligations or capital expenditures. 125 Table of Contents Net interest bearing debt and Net DER are presented in the table below. Billions of Yen As of March 31, 2007 2006 Short-term debt ¥ 658.7 ¥ 540.8 Long-term debt 3,259.4 3,011.9 Less eliminating factors included in long-term debt: Capital lease obligations (24.9 ) (25.7 ) Less SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustment 11.8 37.7 Adjusted interest bearing debt 3,905.0 3,564.7 Less cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (806.6 ) (734.1 ) Net interest bearing debt ¥ 3,098.4 ¥ 2,830.6 Shareholders equity ¥ 2,110.3 ¥ 1,677.9 Net DER (times) 1.47 1.69 The most directly comparable GAAP measure is considered to be Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER). However, this ratio measures gross debt relative to equity, and does not measure changes in cash position. Adjusted DER (times) 1.85 2.13 (defined as adjusted interest bearing debt divided by shareholders equity) Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as the sum of net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities. Management believes that such indicator is useful to investors, to measure available net cash for investment in strategic opportunities and/or debt repayment, or magnitude of reliance on borrowing to procure funds for strategic investments. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. The following table shows a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow. Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities ¥ 239.3 ¥ 146.4 ¥ 200.1 Net cash used in investing activities (418.0 ) (347.3 ) (224.0 ) Free cash flow ¥ (178.7 ) ¥ (200.9 ) ¥ (23.9 ) Finance and Liquidity Management Funding and Treasury Policies and Objectives Our basic funding policy is to secure stable sources of funds to maintain adequate liquidity and financing to satisfy capital requirements for our operations and to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. In order to achieve our objectives, our principal strategy is to obtain long-term funds (those with maturities of around 10 years) from financial institutions, including insurance companies and banks, and through the issuance of corporate bonds. In addition, we utilize financing programs provided by government financing agencies for various projects to obtain long-term financing. Another strategy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to flexibly meet capital requirements and to prepare for future debt-service requirements in case of unforeseen deteriorations 126 Table of Contents in financial markets. We hold cash and cash equivalents as liquidity sources, which consist mainly of highly-liquid and highly-rated short-term financial instruments and deposits. We aim to maintain the proper level of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the current financial market conditions and future capital requirements. In principle, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries do not individually raise their funds in financial markets or borrow from banks, but instead use a cash management service provided by Mitsui & Co. Financial Services Ltd. (Japan), our financing subsidiary. The same policy and practices have been extended to wholly owned overseas subsidiaries through our regional financing subsidiaries, which centralizes the fund raising function and promotes efficient use of funds. Approximately 81% of total interest bearing debt as of March 31, 2007 (excluding SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustment) was raised by Mitsui and the above-mentioned financing subsidiaries as in-house banking bases. Funding Sources We borrow funds based on our longstanding relations with financial institutions in Japan and overseas, borrow from government financing agencies, and also utilize project financing. In addition to these funding sources, Mitsui maintains a ¥200 billion debt shelf-registration and a ¥2,400 billion commercial paper program in Japan. Similarly, Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc., Mitsui & Co. Financial Services (Europe) B.V., Mitsui & Co. Financial Services (Asia) Ltd. and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. have arranged a joint Euro medium-term note (MTN) program of U.S.$5 billion. Mitsui guarantees notes issued by these overseas subsidiaries. For raising short-term funds, Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. has a U.S.$1.5 billion U.S. domestic commercial paper program, and we have made arrangements for commercial paper programs in some other overseas markets. Unused lines of credit, for short-term financing outside of Japan, aggregated ¥626.6 billion at March 31, 2007. Certain overseas subsidiaries compensate banks for these facilities in the form of commitment fees, which were not material in each of the past three years. Taking advantage of a favorable financial market environment, during the year ended March 31, 2007, we increased long-term funding by borrowing from financial institutions and issuing bonds in Japan and MTNs in overseas markets for debt retirement and for working capital requirements. There were five bond issues that raised ¥90.0 billion in total (with maturity of 1012 years) under the shelf-registration in Japan during the year ended March 31, 2007. As a result, long-term debt accounted for approximately 83% of total debt as of March 31, 2007, which we regard as a satisfactory level from the viewpoint of our financial policies. Approximately 73% of the total of short-term and long-term debt as of March 31, 2007 was denominated in Japanese yen and the rest was primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We employ certain derivative financial instruments, which include interest rate swaps, currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts, to manage financial exposures resulting from our financing activities. Currency swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to manage risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The principal financial derivative instruments that are employed to manage interest rate risk exposure are interest rate swap agreements. A large part of such agreements are used for fair value hedging of fixed rate interest bearing debt, including fixed interest rate borrowing, bonds and notes, converting into floating interest rates based on the three-month or six-month LIBOR. The interest rates on approximately 69% of Mitsuis long-term debt, other than borrowings for certain projects, were floating after taking into account interest rate swap arrangements as of March 31, 2007. See Note 26, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, for further description of our risk management policies. Credit Ratings To facilitate access to funds from capital markets, Mitsui and certain of our overseas trading or financing subsidiaries have obtained ratings for their commercial paper (short-term debt) and long-term unsecured senior 127 Table of Contents debt and/or long-term corporate credit from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Services (S&P). Medium-term note program rating has also been given for the above-mentioned MTN program by R&I and Moodys. The ratings as of June 2007 were as follows: R&I Moodys S&P Commercial Paper rating a-1+ P-1 A-1 Long-term corporate credit rating AA-  A Long-term unsecured senior debt rating AA- A2*  Medium-term note program rating AA- A2  * Rating for long-term unsecured notes issued under the MTN program S&P in February 2006 raised our long-term credit rating to A from A- and short-term credit rating to A-1 from A-2. S&P cited the following factors for the change in ratings:  increase in shareholders equity through accumulation of retained earnings as well as public offering;  improvement in profit base and asset quality through refinements in investment and withdrawal decisions for operations; and  enhancement of risk management system. In addition, S&P in May 2007 revised to positive from stable its outlook on the long-term corporate credit rating based on the level of improvement in the balance between capital and risk assets by capital accumulation. Mitsui intends to maintain and improve its current credit ratings by enhancing its earnings and risk management. Credit ratings are an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risks associated with us and are based on information provided by us and other sources that the rating agencies consider reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. Credit ratings do not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and are subject to change or withdrawal by each of the rating agencies at any time. As rating agencies may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated with a company, you should evaluate each rating independently of other ratings. Ratings may be changed without pre-notice at any time. Liquidity Management For the interest rate structure and the maturity profile of our outstanding debt, see Note 13, SHORT-TERM, LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. Cash and cash equivalents were ¥800.0 billion, ¥697.1 billion and ¥791.8 billion as of March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of March 31, 2007, net interest bearing debt (interest bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents and time deposits) was ¥3,098.4 billion, an increase of ¥267.8 billion from ¥2,830.6 billion as of March 31, 2006. However, the Net DER improved from 1.69 as of March 31, 2006 to 1.47 as of March 31, 2007. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities remained comparable from 135.2% as of March 31, 2006 to 133.2% as of March 31, 2007. The increases in investments and other non-current assets are financed mainly by the increases in long-term debt. 128 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2007, we had given guarantees for obligations of various third parties and associated companies. These guarantees are not expected to require substantial use of our capital resources. We have not had any material payment requirements resulting from these guarantees for the past three years. For details on guarantees issued by us, see Note 23, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. With the exception of project financing and non-recourse financing, it is our policy not to conclude agreements for important financial transactions with financial institutions that contain additional debt restriction clauses that may cause acceleration of our obligations, including debt incurrence restrictions, negative pledges, restrictions on dividend payments and various financial ratio limits, and there are no material financial covenants in the agreements undertaken. Assuming that our subsidiaries have sufficient distributable net assets or retained earnings as provided under the local laws of the relevant jurisdictions, there are no material contractual or legal restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances. There are no material economic restrictions on payments of dividends, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries other than general withholding or other taxes calculated at the rates determined by the local tax laws of the relevant jurisdictions. We held ¥800.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2007 in comparison to ¥161.4 billion of outstanding debt with current maturities including commercial paper, MTNs and bonds. Of the cash and cash equivalents, approximately 56% was held by Mitsui and approximately 95% was denominated in Japanese yen. We believe that we maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy our working capital and debt-service requirements for the foreseeable future through existing cash and cash equivalents and time deposits, the sales of certain assets in parallel with outside borrowings from financial institutions, as well as, the issuance of bonds and notes. We plan to contribute ¥8.7 billion to our defined-benefit pension plans for the year ending March 31, 2008. This cash requirement will be managed under our funding policy mentioned above. Investment Plans and Financial Policies of the Medium-Term Management Outlook In May 2006, under our Medium-term Management Outlook, we announced that we planned approximately ¥800 billion expenditure for investments in associated companies, and property and equipment during the two years ending March 31, 2007 and 2008, as well as ¥100 to 200 billion divestiture of existing assets. For the year ended March 31, 2007, net cash used in investing activities was ¥418.0 billion, among which ¥504.2 billion was used in the operating segments other than All Other Segment(*) and Adjustments and Eliminations. We recognize that we have implemented the investment plan ahead of the forecast in May 2006. As of the issuing date of this annual report, we forecast net cash used in investing activities for the year ending March 31, 2008 to be approximately ¥200 billion. Forecasted total investing cash outflows are ¥800 billionexcluding those for liquidity managementreflecting a long list of prospective investment opportunities in mineral resources and energy businesses and others. At the same time, forecasted total cash inflows from divestiture of assets are ¥600 billionalso excluding those for liquidity management. In April 2007, we completed collections of U.S.$1,862.5 million through the transfer of part of our share in the Sakhalin II project and U.S.$981 million through the sale of all our stake in Sesa Goa Limited (India); and came to an agreement to collect approximately U.S.$300 million through the divestiture of all oil and gas interests at Wandoo Petroleum Pty Limited (Australia). All operating segments are proactively seeking opportunities for divesting existing assets which no longer has strategic meanings. (*) Financial services from and to Mitsui and its subsidiaries referred to in Funding and Treasury Policies and Objectives and Liquidity Management above are provided by the All Other Segment. Acquisitions of and proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities as investing activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are mostly conducted by the All Other Segment which includes the units in charge of corporate financing and liquidity management as discussed in Funding Sources. 129 Table of Contents Considering the above-mentioned ¥200 billion of net cash used in investing activities as well as increase of shareholders equity from operating activities, we forecast that total interest bearing debt as of March 31, 2008 will remain at the same level as March 31, 2007. We will procure funds for refinance by direct financing from capital markets and fund raisingincluding project financefrom the private sector and government financing agencies, especially paying attention to the trend of Japanese yen interest rate. We also forecast a Net DER of around 1.3 as of March 31, 2008. Many of the projects in the investment plan involve bidding. The outcome of bidding will have an effect on our actual cash flows and financial condition for the year ending March 31, 2008. Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders Equity Total assets as of March 31, 2007 were ¥9,813.3 billion, an increase of ¥1,239.7 billion from ¥8,573.6 billion as of March 31, 2006. Current assets as of March 31, 2007 were ¥5,073.8 billion, an increase of ¥327.0 billion from ¥4,746.8 billion as of March 31, 2006 due to increases in the following items:  Cash and cash equivalents increased by ¥102.9 billion, mainly at Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan) which was acquired during the year ended March 31, 2007 and at Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia) which recorded increased sales.  Trade receivablesaccounts increased by ¥202.5 billion, mainly in the Iron & Steel Raw Materials and Non-Ferrous Metals Segment boosted by higher market prices of commodities. Total current liabilities as of March 31, 2007 were ¥3,810.2 billion, an increase of ¥299.3 billion from ¥3,510.9 billion as of March 31, 2006. The main factors were as follows:  Short-term debt increased by ¥117.9 billion mainly at overseas financial subsidiaries.  Trade payablesaccounts increased by ¥204.6 billion corresponding to the above-mentioned increase in trade receivablesaccounts. As a result, working capital, or current assets minus current liabilities, as of March 31, 2007 was ¥1,263.6 billion, a ¥27.7 billion increase from ¥1,235.9 billion as of March 31, 2006. The sum of total investments and non-current receivables, property and equipmentat cost, intangible assets less accumulated amortization, deferred tax assetsnon current and other assets totaled ¥4,739.5 billion as of March 31, 2007, a ¥912.8 billion increase from ¥3,826.7 billion as of March 31, 2006, mainly due to the following factors:  Within total investments and non-current receivables, investments in and advances to associated companies as of March 31, 2007 were ¥1,587.6 billion, a ¥287.0 billion increase from ¥1,300.6 billion as of March 31, 2006. Major components were:  the investments in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda), a project implementing vehicle of the Sakhalin II project, for ¥110.0 billion (including effect from foreign exchange translation of ¥2.2 billion) in the Energy Segment;  the acquisition of gas distribution business in Brazil for ¥30.7 billion (including effect from foreign exchange translation of ¥3.3 billion) in the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment;  the acquisition of shares in Asahi Tec Corporation (Japan), an automobile parts manufacturer, for ¥11.8 billion in the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment;  the investment in Greenfield Energy Center LP (Canada), an independent power producer, for ¥11.4 billion in the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment;  the acquisition of shares in Moshi Moshi Hotline, Inc.

In the nanotechnology field, a key research area in the Chemical Segment, we have been developing and promoting the commercialization of ethanol separation technology using zeolite membranes, which will dramatically improve the energy efficiency of biomass ethanol production. Biomass ethanol is a renewable energy source, and as such it is being utilized all over the world as an additive for automobile gasoline and fuel for power generation, as a means of addressing the issue of global warming. By realizing improved energy efficiency in the production of biomass ethanol through the use of zeolite membranes, it is expected to contribute to reduction of CO2 emissions and improvement of the global environment. Carbon nanotubes are expected to be developed for a variety of advanced applications in the future, and we have set up a joint venture with Hodogaya Chemical Co., Ltd. to continue research and development, production and distribution of nanotubes. Some results are close to practical application. Along with this work, we are also carrying out research on related safety issues. For the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, R&D expenses were ¥5.1 billion and ¥5.6 billion respectively, including ¥3.4 billion and ¥3.9 billion expenditure by the Chemical Segment, respectively.

The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provision or from collateral held or pledged that we could be obliged to pay if there were defaults by guaranteed parties or there were changes in an underlying which would cause triggering events under market value guarantees and indemnification contracts. Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications, and they greatly exceed anticipated losses. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amounts of liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect our best estimate of future payments we may incur as part of fulfilling our guarantee obligations.

Compensation. The aggregate amount of compensation and benefits in kind paid to Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers during the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥4,071 million. A breakdown is provided as below. Directors and Corporate Auditors The remuneration of Directors and Corporate Auditors totaling ¥1,011 million during the year ended March 31, 2007 was as follows. Number of recipients Total remuneration paidrelating to the yearended March 31, 2007 Directors 11 ¥ 884 million Corporate Auditors 6 ¥ 127 million External Directors and Corporate Auditors (included in the above amounts) 7 ¥ 61 million Total 17 ¥ 1,011 million Notes: i) Limits on remuneration of Directors and Corporate Auditors have been determined by General Meeting of Shareholders resolutions as follows: for Directors, there is a total limit of ¥60 million per month (by resolution of June 27, 2002); for Corporate Auditors, there is a total limit of ¥12 million per month (by resolution of June 24, 2004). ii) The above amounts include ¥271 million in bonuses for Directors (excluding external Directors), which was approved at the 88th General Meeting of Shareholders on June 22, 2007. In advance of Notice of the 88th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholder to Mitsuis shareholders, the Remuneration Committee, an advisory body of the Mitsuis Board of Directors chaired by an External Director, reported to the Board of Directors that ¥271 million was an appropriate amount for bonuses. iii) The Board of Directors determines the amount of bonuses payable to each Director. The amounts of Directors bonuses have been set reflecting the level of consolidated net income pursuant to certain formulas which the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee have reviewed and modified step by step. Now total bonuses for Directors (excluding External Directors) will be calculated as the lesser of consolidated net income x 0.1% and ¥500 million, which will be payable to each director in proportionate allocation according to points given to each Directors position. The Remuneration Committee also reviewed the formula and reported to the Board of Directors in advance of the Board of Directors decision to establish the formula. Executive Officers The remuneration of Executive Officers (excluding Executive Officers who are also Directors) totaled ¥2,365 million during the year ended March 31, 2007, which comprised of ¥1,035 million bonuses and ¥1,330 million monthly remunerations. The Remuneration Committee also reviews and reports to the Board of Directors on appropriateness of remuneration system and compensation levels for Executive Officers. Pension Plans and Retirement Allowances In addition, the aggregate amount of benefits from Directors and Corporate Auditors Pension Plans and retirement allowances for retiring Directors and Corporate Auditorsaccrued prior to the abolition of the retirement allowance systempaid during the year ended March 31, 2007 was ¥695 million. Our retirement allowance system for Directors and Corporate Auditors was abolished pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors in February 2004. Up to this resolution, in accordance with customary Japanese business practices, a retiring Director or Corporate Auditor was entitled to receive a retirement allowance, which was subject to approval by shareholders at a general meeting of shareholders. The amount of the retirement allowance generally reflected the number of years of service, rank at the time of retirement and 152 Table of Contents special contributions to our performance. After the abolition of the retirement allowance system, retirement allowances are not paid except for those accrued prior to the abolition. The aggregate amount set aside by us to provide pension benefits to Directors and Corporate Auditors was ¥2,651 million as of March 31, 2007. Mitsui has no stock option plans for Mitsuis Directors and Senior Management as of June 30, 2007. C. Board Practices. The information in Item 6.A. Directors and Senior Management is incorporated into this section by reference. None of our Directors have entered into any service contracts with us providing for benefits upon termination of his or her employment. The Corporate Law of Japan allows a company to adopt the Committee System as the framework for corporate governance. We have decided, however, to maintain the corporate auditor system because we believe that our Corporate Auditors, of whom three are full-time and four are external Auditors as of June 30, 2007 and their functions are legally defined and reinforced, provide adequate auditing functions. Furthermore, internal Directors are familiar with our business operations and can therefore contribute to effective management. Although we retained the corporate auditor system, we have decided to adopt certain aspects of the Committee System and have established three committees (the Governance Committee, the Nomination Committee, and the Remuneration Committee) to provide advice to the Board of Directors. In addition, other measures have been taken, such as shortening the term of Directors and Executive Officers from two years to one year, eliminating the retirement allowance, and increasing the number of external Directors. Our Directors and Corporate Auditors are elected at the general meeting of shareholders. In accordance with our Articles of Incorporation, the normal term of office for our Directors is one year(1) and for our Corporate Auditors is four years. However, they may both serve any number of consecutive terms. The following table shows our Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers terms of office and their shareholdings as of June 30, 2007.

Under the Corporate Law of Japan, each of the Representative Directors has statutory authority and power to represent and act on behalf of the company in all respects. Under the Corporate Law of Japan, at least half of the Corporate Auditors should be persons who have not at any time been a director, executive officer, manager or employee of a company or any of its subsidiaries prior to his or her election as a Corporate Auditor. Each Corporate Auditor has a statutory duty to examine financial statements, in collaboration with independent auditors, and business reports and also to supervise the administration of the companys affairs by Directors. Corporate Auditors are required to participate in meetings of the Board of Directors but are not entitled to vote. The Board of Corporate Auditors is comprised of all Corporate Auditors. The Board of Corporate Auditors has a statutory duty to prepare its audit report each year. A Corporate Auditor may note his or her opinion in the audit report if his or her opinion is different from the opinion expressed in the independent auditors report. The Board of Corporate Auditors is empowered to establish audit principles, methods of examination by the Corporate Auditors of the companys affairs and financial position and other matters concerning the performance of the Corporate Auditors duties. The Corporate Auditors may not at the same time be directors, managers or employees of the company or any of its subsidiaries. Exemption from Certain Corporate Governance Requirements of NASDAQ.

As a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP for inclusion in our annual report on Form 20-F, which must be filed within six months after the end of each fiscal year.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(1) requires that a majority of the board of directors of each issuer be independent directors as defined in Rule 4200, and Rule 4350(c)(2) requires that independent directors of each issuer have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. For Japanese companies, including us, which employ a corporate governance system based on a board of corporate auditors, the Corporate Law of Japan has no independence requirement with respect to directors. The task of overseeing management and accounting firms is assigned to the corporate auditors, who are separate from the companys management. Japanese companies, including us, which employ a corporate governance system based on a board of corporate auditors, are required to have at least 50% external corporate auditor who must meet additional independence requirements under the Corporate Law of Japan. An external corporate auditor is defined in the Corporate Law of Japan as a 155 Table of Contents corporate auditor who has not served as a director, executive officer, manager or any other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries at any time prior to the appointment. Currently, we have four external Corporate Auditors. Our Board of Corporate Auditors, which, as explained below, performs functions similar to those of an audit committee, has regularly scheduled meetings at which only Corporate Auditors are present.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2) requires that each issuer have and will continue to have an audit committee of at least three members, each of whom (1) is independent as defined under Rule 4200(a)(15), (2) meets the requirements of Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (3) has not participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the issuer or any current subsidiary thereof at any time during the past three years, and (4) is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a companys balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement, as required by Rule 4350(d)(2). Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(1) requires that each issuer have adopted a formal written audit committee charter specifying the items enumerated in that rule and that its audit committee have reviewed and reassessed the adequacy of the charter on an annual basis. Under the Corporate Law of Japan, we are not required to establish or maintain such an audit committee. The Corporate Law of Japan has no independence requirement with respect to directors of large companies (defined under the Corporate Law of Japan as joint stock corporations with stated capital of ¥500 million or more or with total liabilities equal to or exceeding ¥20 billion), including Mitsui, that employ a corporate governance system based on a board of corporate auditors. In many such large companies, functions similar to those of such an audit committee are performed by its board of corporate auditors. We have established such a Board of Corporate Auditors, each of whom does not concurrently serve as a director, manager or any other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries. Under the Corporate Law of Japan, corporate auditors are elected at a general meeting of shareholders and are under a statutory duty to review the administration of the affairs of Mitsui by its Directors and to examine financial statements and other documents and reports of Mitsui. Japanese companies, including us, which employ a corporate governance system based on a board of corporate auditors, are required to have at least 50% external corporate auditor who must meet additional independence requirements under the Corporate Law of Japan. An external corporate auditor is defined in the Corporate Law of Japan as a corporate auditor who had not served as a director, executive officer, manager or any other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries at any time prior to the appointment. Currently, we have seven Corporate Auditors, four of whom are external Corporate Auditors who meet these additional requirements. Mitsuis Board of Corporate Auditors has adopted its own code of auditing standards setting forth the scope of its responsibilities and the manner in which it carries out such responsibilities, and certain other matters.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(3) requires that compensation of the chief executive officer of each issuer be determined by, or recommended by its board of directors for determination either by (i) a majority of its independent directors or (ii) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors, and that compensation of all other executive officers be determined by, or recommended by the board of directors for determination either by (i) a majority of the independent directors or (ii) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. As explained above, we are not required to have independent directors. With regard to director compensation (excluding bonuses, etc.), the Corporate Law of Japan requires the board of directors to pass a board resolution proposing director compensation to be submitted for approval at a general meeting of shareholders. Within the upper limit approved at the general meeting of shareholders, the board of directors may determine the amount of compensation for each director. The board of directors, by resolution of the board of directors, may delegate such decision to the chief executive officer or other persons authorized by the board of directors. As for Mitsui, the upper limit of compensation for its Directors approved by the general meeting of shareholders is 70 million yen per month and the Board of Directors has determined to delegate to the Chief Executive Officer the decision-making authority as to the amount of compensation for each Director within such limit. In addition to regular compensation, the aggregate amount of bonuses and other financial benefits payable to Directors as consideration for the performance of their duties is also subject to approval by shareholders at a general meeting of shareholders under the 156 Table of Contents Corporate Law of Japan. With regard to employee (including officer) compensation, an approval at the general meeting of shareholders is not required under the Corporate Law of Japan. Therefore, the board of directors has the authority to determine matters relating to employee compensation. The board of directors, by resolution of the board of directors, may delegate employee compensation matters to the chief executive officer or other persons authorized by the board of directors. As for Mitsui, its Board of Directors has duly resolved Regulations for Executive Officers, which provide that Executive Officers who are also Directors of the Company shall not be paid any compensation in their capacities as Executive Officers and that the compensation of the Executive Officers who are not Directors of the Company shall be decided by the Board of Directors, or decided by the Chief Executive Officer or other Officers authorized by the Board of Directors. Mitsui determines compensation of its Chief Executive Officer and other Officers in accordance with the aforementioned procedures. Corporate auditors do not have any specific duties with respect to compensation of the chief executive officer and other executive officers under the Corporate Law of Japan. However, the duties of corporate auditors include a general duty to audit the affairs of the company to ensure that the business is being operated in accordance with applicable law and its charter. If the corporate auditors conclude, in connection with the performance of those duties, that the compensation of directors violated applicable law or the companys charter, the corporate auditors are required to report their conclusion to the general meeting of shareholders and may bring a lawsuit against the responsible directors.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(4) requires that director nominees be selected or recommended for the board of directors selection either by (i) a majority of the independent directors or (ii) a nomination committee comprised solely of independent directors. Also, Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(4)(B) requires that each issuer have adopted a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing the nominations process and such related matters as may be required under the U.S. federal securities laws. As explained above, we are not required to have independent directors. Under the Corporate Law of Japan, a director may be nominated by (i) a resolution of the board of directors or (ii) a shareholder owning one percent or more of the outstanding shares of a company or 300 or more shares of the company for at least 6 months. Approval by a majority of the shareholders in attendance at a general meeting of shareholders is required to elect a director. There is no specific requirement that a company adopt a written charter or board resolution addressing the nominations process, nor is it customary to do so. As for Mitsui, nominations of Directors of Mitsui are approved at a meeting of the Nomination Committee, a non-statutory committee established as an advisory board to the Board of Directors, prior to being submitted to a general meeting of shareholders. Corporate auditors do not have any specific duties with respect to nomination of directors under the Corporate Law of Japan. However, the duties of corporate auditors include a general duty to audit the affairs of the company to ensure that the business is being operated in accordance with applicable law and its charter. If the corporate auditors conclude, in connection with the performance of those duties, that the nomination of directors violated applicable law or the companys charter, the corporate auditors are required to report their conclusion to the general meeting of shareholders and may bring a lawsuit against the responsible directors.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(f) requires that there be a provision in the by-laws for a quorum for any meeting of the holders of common stock and that such quorum be not less than 33 1/3% of the outstanding shares of the common voting stock. In accordance with the Corporate Law of Japan, however, under our Articles of Incorporation no quorum is required for the adoption of resolutions at a general meeting of shareholders, except for (i) the election of Directors and Corporate Auditors for which the quorum shall not be less than one-third of the total voting rights and (ii) resolutions for other specified issues required by the Corporate Law of Japan (the special shareholders resolutions), which include an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, a reduction of stated capital, the removal of a Corporate Auditor, dissolution, merger or consolidation requiring shareholders resolution, the transfer of the whole or an important part of the business, the taking over of the whole of the business of any other corporation requiring shareholders resolutions, share exchange or share transfer requiring shareholders resolution for the purpose of establishing 100% parent-subsidiary relationships, splitting of the corporation into two or more corporations requiring shareholders resolution, any offering of new shares 157 Table of Contents at a specially favorable price (or any offering of the rights to subscribe for, or acquire its shares at a specially favorable conditions) to any persons other than shareholders, for which the quorum shall be at least one-third of the total voting rights and the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting rights represented at the meeting is required. This approach is consistent with generally accepted business practices of publicly-held companies in Japan.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(g) provides that each issuer solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of shareholders and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to Nasdaq. Currently a Japanese company whose shares are listed on the securities exchanges defined in the Securities and Exchange Law, including us, may, but is not required to, solicit proxies for meetings of shareholders. If such a Japanese company solicits proxies for a meeting of shareholders, it is required to provide proxy statements and documents for reference as provided for in the Securities and Exchange Law and provide copies of such proxy statements and documents for reference to the Kanto Local Finance Bureau.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(h) provides that each issuer conduct appropriate review of all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis and that all such transactions be approved by the issuers audit committee or another independent body of the board of directors. Following the requirements of the Corporate Law of Japan, we require a Director to obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in order for such Director to enter into such transactions.  Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1) requires that shareholder approval be obtained for the issuance of the issuers stock in certain conditions or certain specified transactions described therein. The Corporate Law of Japan requires us to seek shareholder approval of various matters, and in certain instances the special shareholders resolutions as described above are required for approval. In addition, while the Corporate Law of Japan permits, in certain instances, the issuance of equity securities without shareholder approval, the Corporate Law of Japan also contains provisions requiring the timely dissemination of information relating to such issuance, allowing for opportunities for shareholders to voice their concern with such issuance, and mandating the election of corporate auditors whose fiduciary duty is to, among other things, oversee on behalf of the shareholders actions by the board of directors relating to such issuance. The rights of ADS holders, including their rights relating to corporate governance practices, are provided in the deposit agreement. Limitation of Liabilities of Directors and Corporate Auditors The Articles of Incorporation of Mitsui provide that Mitsui may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, limit the liabilities of Directors and Corporate Auditors to the extent as permitted by the Corporate Law of Japan. The Articles of Incorporation of Mitsui also provide that Mitsui may conclude a contract with external Directors and external Corporate Auditors to limit the liability of such Directors and Corporate Auditors to the extent as permitted by the Corporate Law of Japan. In accordance with such provision of the Articles of Incorporation, Mitsui has concluded with external Directors (Mr. Akishige Okada, Ms. Nobuko Matsubara, Mr. Ikujiro Nonaka and Mr. Hiroshi Hirabayashi) and external Corporate Auditors (Mr. Ko Matsukata, Mr. Yasutaka Okamura, Mr. Hideharu Kadowaki and Mr. Naoto Nakamura), respectively, contracts to limit their liability to the extent permitted by the Corporate Law of Japan. D. Employees As of March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we had 41,761, 40,993 and 38,210 employees, respectively. The average number of temporary employees during the year ended March 31, 2007 was 15,768. 158 Table of Contents The following table provides the numbers of employees by operating segment as of the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

E. Share Ownership. Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers As of June 30, 2007, the members of Mitsuis Board of Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers held as a group, 630,320 shares of our common stock, representing 0.04% of the shares outstanding. This number of shares included 64,931 shares held by Mitsui Executives Shareholding Association. None of Mitsuis Directors, Corporate Auditors nor Executive Officers is the beneficial owner of more than 1% of Mitsuis common stock. The number of shares held by Mitsuis Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers, on an individual basis, is provided in Item 6.C. Board Practices, and is incorporated herein by reference. In July, 2006, a new management shareholding scheme was introduced, whereby each of Mitsuis Directors (excluding external Directors) and Executive Officers are required to purchase Mitsuis shares through Mitsui Executives Shareholding Association. Mitsuis Directors (excluding external Directors) and Executive Officers purchase Mitsuis shares in an amount equivalent to 10% of his or her salary, which amount is deducted from his or her salary for the purchases through said Mitsui Executives Shareholding Association. Employees Shareholding Association Mitsui operates an Employees Shareholding Association which, as of June 30, 2007, had 3,377 employee member participants. Employee members declare monthly the amount to be deducted from his or her salary to be used to purchase shares of common stock of Mitsui through the Employees Shareholding Association. Employee members receive from Mitsui a monthly subsidy equivalent to 10% of the declared amount, enabling them to purchase shares equivalent to 110% of the declared amount. Employee members are entitled to dividends which are applied towards the purchase of additional shares through the Employees Shareholding Association. Employee members are able to sell part of their shares that have been reserved for them under the Employees Shareholding 159 Table of Contents Associations plan, in multiples of 1,000 shares, once every month. As of June 30, 2007, the total amount of shares having voting rights owned by the Employees Shareholding Association was 10,633,894, representing 0.59% of the total shares issued and outstanding. Mitsui does not have any other arrangements for its employees that involves the issue or grant of options, shares or securities of Mitsui. Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.

The voting rights of our major shareholders do not differ from the voting rights of other shareholders. To our knowledge, we are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any other corporations, by any foreign government or by any other natural or legal persons severally or jointly. We know of no arrangements which may, at a subsequent date, result in a change in control of Mitsui. B. Related Party Transactions When conducting our business operations throughout the world, we form alliances with leading partner companies in Japan and overseas, including manufacturers and companies in the field of natural resources, such 161 Table of Contents as energy and ferrous materials. In addition to investing in, or providing loans to, associated companies where we are a minority shareholder, we conduct selling and purchasing transactions of various products on a recurring basis with such associated companies. Our principal associated companies include Valepar S.A. (18.2%), Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. (50.0%), P.T. Paiton Energy(36.3%), Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (25.0%), IPM Eagle LLP (30.0%),Nihon Unisys, Ltd. (31.8%) and Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (16.4%), among others.

See Note 6, INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO ASSOCIATED COMPANIES to our consolidated financial statements. Prices applied in transactions with associated companies are computed in the same way that such prices would be calculated in transactions with unrelated third parties. In addition, when associated companies are counterparties in transactions with us and we conduct such business under long-term procurement and/or sales contracts, in general, we conclude a corresponding sales contract with the purchasers (unrelated parties) of goods procured by us and/or with suppliers (unrelated parties) of the goods we sell to associated companies. Regarding any other commitments related to transactions with associated companies, we do not normally assume risk in excess of its percentage of share ownership in an associated company. In furtherance of their trading activities, it is customary practice for us to loan or guarantee, severally and jointly with others, indebtedness of certain customers and suppliers and of certain associated companies as well as to guarantee the performance of contracts by such entities. At March 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of loans (including ¥67 billion guarantees) relating to associated companies was ¥200 billion. The largest amount outstanding as of March 31, 2007 was ¥26 billion loan with no interest to P.T. Paiton Energy Co., which owns and operates a coal-fired power plant in East Java, Indonesia. The loan was mainly from Paiton Power Financing B.V., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsui engaged in the financing for P.T. Paiton Energy Co. Other major loans to associated companies are related to the power plant project and the projects in the development of natural resources jointly invested with other partners.

In the opinion of management, any liability will not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Dividend Policy We have set the target dividend payout ratio at 20% of consolidated net income, and by growing profits at Mitsui will aim to progressively and sustainably increase dividend payments.

Item 9. The Offer and Listing. A. Offer and Listing Details. The primary market for Mitsuis common stock is the Tokyo Stock Exchange, or TSE. Mitsuis common stock is traded on the First Section of the TSE and is also listed on four other stock exchanges in Japan (Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo Stock Exchanges). Mitsuis American Depository Shares (ADSs), each representing 20 shares of common stock, are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MITSY. American Depository Receipts (ADRs), each evidencing one or more ADSs, were originally issued pursuant to a Deposit Agreement in May 1963, as amended from time to time, that we entered into with Citibank N.A. of New York as Depositary and the holders of the ADRs. 163 Table of Contents The following table provides the reported high and low closing sales prices of our common stock on the TSE and the reported high and low closing bid price quotations per ADS for the period indicated: TSE NASDAQ Price per Share ofCommon Stock(Yen) Price per ADS(U.S. dollars)(1) High Low High Low Year ended March 31: 2003 ¥ 910 ¥ 531 $ 146.75 $ 89.40 2004 946 541 181.50 90.90 2005 1,074 773 206.20 137.50 2006 1,731 908 292.66 171.50 2007 2,315 1,427 382.21 245.00 Year ended March 31, 2006: First quarter ¥ 1,050 ¥ 908 $ 192.44 $ 171.50 Second quarter 1,490 1,015 270.10 182.53 Third quarter 1,583 1,343 267.50 225.98 Fourth quarter 1,731 1,481 292.66 255.30 Year ending March 31, 2007: First quarter ¥ 1,824 ¥ 1,427 $ 326.00 $ 249.42 Second quarter 1,750 1,445 304.00 249.46 Third quarter 1,788 1,430 301.90 245.00 Fourth quarter 2,315 1,671 382.21 281.44 Year ending March 31, 2008: First quarter ¥ 2,595 ¥ 2,040 $ 416.60 $ 347.21 Month of: March 2007 ¥ 2,220 ¥ 1,979 $ 381.00 $ 337.71 April 2007 2,195 2,040 371.90 347.21 May 2007 2,400 2,180 403.00 367.01 June 2007 2,595 2,380 416.60 391.00 July 2007 2,880 2,530 475.96 413.05 August 2007 2,650 2,005 455.95 371.60 (1) All fractional figures of the prices per ADS are rounded to the nearest two decimal points. Share prices on Japanese stock exchanges are determined on a real-time basis by the equilibrium between bids and offers. These exchanges set daily price limits, which limit the maximum range of fluctuation within a single trading day. Daily price limits are set according to the previous days closing price or special quote. Although transactions may continue at the upward or downward limit price if the limit price is reached on a particular trading day, no transactions may take place outside these limits. Consequently, an investor wishing to sell at a price above or below the relevant daily limit may not be able to sell his shares at such price on a particular trading day, or at all. On September 19, 2007, the closing sales price per share of our common stock on the TSE was ¥2,575, and the closing sales price per ADS on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was U.S.$452.51. B.
