ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this Form 10-K (particularly in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) or in our other filings with the SEC, the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forward-looking statement. We cannot guarantee that our actual results will be consistent with the forward-looking statements we make in this report, and we do not assume an obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 14 Adverse business and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. General economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods, employment levels, the availability and cost of credit, and ultimately, the profitability of our business. High unemployment rates, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Risks Related to Industry Conditions The paper industry experiences cyclicality; changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Historically, macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity have created cyclical changes in prices, sales volumes, and margins for our products. Changing industry conditions can influence paper and packaging producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills. In addition, to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill, some producers will choose to continue to operate at a loss, sometimes even a cash loss, which could prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply. Oversupply in these markets can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable short-term pricing trends. Industry supply is also influenced by overseas production capacity, which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. A weak U.S. dollar tends to mitigate the levels of imports, while a strong U.S. dollar tends to increase imports of commodity paper products from overseas, putting downward pressure on prices. Prices for all of our products are driven by many factors outside our control, and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. Market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our commodity products, and as a result, the price for any one or more of these products may fall below our cash production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities. From time to time, we have taken downtime (or slowed production) at some of our mills to balance our production with the market demand for our products, and we may continue to do so in the future. Some of our competitors may also close or reduce production at their operating facilities, some of which could reopen and increase production capacity. This potential supply and demand imbalance could cause prices to fall. Therefore, our ability to achieve acceptable operating performance and margins is principally dependent on managing our cost structure, managing changes in raw materials prices (which represent a large component of our operating costs and fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control), and general conditions in the paper market. If the prices for our products decline or if our raw material costs increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Some of our paper products are vulnerable to long-term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials. Our uncoated freesheet papers and newsprint compete with electronic data transmission, document storage alternatives, and paper grades we do not produce. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage. Neither the timing nor the extent of this shift can be predicted with certainty. Because of these trends, demand for paper products may shift from one grade of paper to another or be eliminated altogether. We face strong competition in our markets. The paper and packaging and newsprint industries are highly competitive. We face competition from numerous competitors, domestic as well as foreign. Some of our competitors are large, vertically integrated companies that have greater financial and other resources, greater manufacturing economies of scale, greater energy self- 15 sufficiency, or lower operating costs, compared with our company. We may be unable to compete with other companies in the market during the various stages of the business cycle and particularly during any downturns. Some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors (including foreign producers) into the markets we serve, our competitors pricing strategies, our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, and our inability to maintain the cost-efficiency of our facilities. Increases in the cost of our raw materials, including wood fiber, chemicals, and energy, could affect our profitability. We rely heavily on raw materials, including wood fiber and chemicals, and energy sources, including natural gas and electricity. Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials. For most of our products, the relationship between industry supply and demand, rather than changes in the cost of raw materials, determines our ability to increase prices. Consequently, we may be unable to pass increases in our operating costs on to our customers in the short term. Any sustained increase in raw material costs, coupled with our inability to increase prices, would reduce our operating margins and potentially require us to limit or cease operations of one or more of our machines or facilities. Wood fiber is our principal raw material, accounting for approximately 31% and 18%, respectively, of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses, including fiber costs, for our Paper and Packaging segments for the year ended December 31, 2010. Wood fiber is a commodity, and prices have historically been cyclical. In addition, wood fiber, including wood chips, sawdust, and shavings, is a byproduct in the manufacture of building products, and the availability of wood fiber is often negatively affected if demand for building products declines. Severe or sustained shortages of fiber could cause us to curtail our own operations, resulting in material and adverse effects on our sales and profitability. Future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, and forest health can also affect log and fiber supply. Energy accounts for approximately 13% and 12%, respectively, of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses, including fiber costs, for our Paper and Packaging segments for the year ended December 31, 2010. Energy prices, particularly for electricity and natural gas, have been volatile in recent years. These fluctuations affect our manufacturing costs and can contribute significantly to earnings volatility. Other raw materials we use include various chemical compounds, such as starch, caustic soda, precipitated calcium carbonate, sodium chlorate, dyestuffs, and optical brighteners. Purchases of chemicals accounted for approximately 15% and 6%, respectively, of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses, including fiber costs, for our Paper and Packaging segments for the year ended December 31, 2010. The costs of these chemicals have been volatile historically and are influenced by capacity utilization, energy prices, and other factors beyond our control. Risks Related to Our Operations We depend on OfficeMax for a significant portion of our business. Our largest customer, OfficeMax, accounted for approximately 24% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2010. In October 2004, OfficeMax agreed to purchase, from our Predecessor, its full North American requirements for cut-size office paper, to the extent Boise chooses to supply such paper to them, through December 2012. OfficeMaxs purchase obligations under the agreement will phase out ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the delivery of notice of termination, but in no event will the purchase obligation be reduced prior to December 31, 2012. If this contract is not renewed or not renewed on terms similar to the existing terms, our future business operations may be adversely affected. If OfficeMax were unable to pay, our financial performance could be affected significantly and negatively. Any significant deterioration in the financial condition of OfficeMax or a significant change in its business that would affect its willingness to continue to purchase our 16 products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, or negatively affect our net income. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including the following:  Maintenance outages.  Prolonged power failures.  Equipment failure.  Disruption in the supply of raw materials, such as wood fiber, energy, or chemicals.  A chemical spill or release.  Closure because of environmental-related concerns.  Explosion of a boiler.  The effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on our water supply.  Disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks, and tunnels.  Fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other catastrophes.  Terrorism or threats of terrorism.  Labor difficulties.  Other operational problems. Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results. Labor disruptions or increased labor costs could materially adversely affect our business. While we believe we have good labor relations, we could experience a material labor disruption, strike, or significantly increased labor costs at one or more of our facilities, either in the course of negotiations of a labor agreement or otherwise. Either of these situations could prevent us from meeting customer demands or result in increased costs, thereby reducing our sales and profitability. As of January 31, 2011, we had approximately 4,100 employees. Approximately 57% of these employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. As of January 31, 2011, approximately 50% of our employees were working pursuant to collective bargaining agreements that have expired or will expire within one year, including agreements at the following facility locations: Wallula, Washington; Nampa, Idaho; DeRidder, Louisiana; Jackson, Alabama; and International Falls, Minnesota. The labor contract at our paper mill in Wallula, Washington (332 employees represented by the Association of Western Pulp & Paper Workers, or AWPPW) expired in March 2009 and was terminated by the AWPPW in October 2009. In February 2010, the union employees at Wallula rejected a new collective bargaining agreement that union leadership had recommended unanimously, and we declared an impasse in the bargaining process and implemented the terms of the last contract offer. We are currently negotiating the labor contract at our corrugated container plant in Nampa, Idaho (108 employees represented by the AWPPW), which expired on December 31, 2010. In February 2011, union employees represented by the United 17 Steelworkers at our mills in DeRidder, Louisiana (approximately 360 employees); Jackson, Alabama (approximately 400 employees); and International Falls, Minnesota (approximately 160 employees) ratified a new master labor contract. We have 60 days to negotiate local issues. The negotiations with the remaining unions at our paper mill in International Falls began in late February 2011. Our potential inability to reach a mutually acceptable labor contract at any of our facilities could result in, among other things, strikes or other work stoppages or slowdowns by the affected employees. While the company has in place contingency plans to address labor disturbances, we could experience disruption to our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Future labor agreements could increase our costs of healthcare, retirement benefits, wages, and other employee benefits. Additionally, labor issues that affect our suppliers could also have a material adverse effect on us if those issues interfere with our ability to obtain raw materials on a cost-effective and timely basis. We are subject to significant environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and the cost of compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operation. We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may face civil or criminal fines, penalties, or enforcement actions, including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment, or other remedial actions. We anticipate that governmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that we will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws. For example, on June 4, 2010, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters (aka Boiler MACT rules). The recently released Boiler MACT rules will require process modifications and/or installation of air pollution controls on power boilers (principally our biomass-fuel-fired boilers) at our pulp and paper mills, and we are currently reviewing those rules to understand the effect they will have on our operations. The cost of compliance is likely to be significant. Our early estimates indicated compliance could result in additional capital spending of up to $90 million over a three-year period. We may also be affected by the enactment of laws concerning climate change that regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Such laws may require buying allowances for mill GHG emissions or capital expenditures to reduce GHG emissions. Because environmental regulations are not consistent worldwide, our capital and operating expenditures for environmental compliance may adversely affect our ability to compete. We spent $4 million in 2010 and expect to spend about the same amount in 2011 for capital environmental compliance requirements. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant additional expenditures. We may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures. We recently acquired Tharco Packaging, Inc., and may engage in future acquisitions, which in each case could materially affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition to our recent acquisition, we may continue seeking to acquire other businesses, products, or assets. However, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Our recent acquisition and, assuming we complete them, additional acquisitions may not strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals. Our recent acquisition and any future acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our recent 18 acquisition and future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage the integration of our recently acquired business, or businesses we may acquire in the future, or be able to retain and motivate key personnel from those businesses. Any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Risks Related to Economic and Financial Factors We have substantial indebtedness, and our ability to repay our debt is dependent on our ability to generate cash from operations. As of December 31, 2010, our total indebtedness was $781.8 million. Our ability to repay our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from future operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, to obtain additional debt, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations require substantial capital, and we may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of our capital requirements. Our businesses are capital-intensive, and we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment, increase our operating efficiency, and comply with environmental laws. In addition, significant amounts of capital are required to modify our equipment to produce alternative or additional products or to make significant improvements in the characteristics of our current products. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $111.6 million. We expect to spend between $115 million and $125 million on capital investments during 2011. If we require funds for operating needs and capital expenditures beyond those generated from operations, we may not be able to obtain them on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our debt service obligations will reduce our available cash flows. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as necessary for our continued operations or as needed to ensure environmental compliance, we could be required to cease or curtail some of our manufacturing operations or we may become unable to manufacture products that can compete effectively in one or more of our markets. Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us, and a default under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our credit facilities require BZ Intermediate Holdings LLC (Holdings) and its subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests. These tests include, in the case of our credit facilities, a total leverage ratio, a secured leverage ratio, and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, our credit facilities restrict, and the indenture governing the 9% and 8% senior notes restrict, among other things, the ability of Holdings and its subsidiaries to create additional liens on assets, make investments or acquisitions, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets including capital stock of subsidiaries, make capital expenditures, place restrictions on the ability of such subsidiaries to make distributions, enter into transactions with our affiliates, enter into new lines of business, and engage in consolidations, mergers, or sales of substantially all of our assets. We will need to seek permission from the lenders under our indebtedness to engage in specified corporate actions. The lenders interests may be different from our interests, and no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the lenders permission when needed. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants (or similar covenants contained in future financing agreements) could result in a default under the credit facilities, the indenture governing the 9% and 8% senior notes, and other agreements containing cross-default provisions, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and 19 results of operations. A default would permit lenders or holders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements, to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt, and to terminate any commitments to lend. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including the obligations of Boise Paper Holdings, L.L.C., Boise Finance Company, and Boise Co-Issuer Company under the 9% and 8% senior notes. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We anticipate significant future funding obligations for pension benefits. In December 2008, we enacted a freeze on our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees (the Salaried Plan); however, we continue to maintain defined benefit pension plans for most of our union employees. Despite the freeze of the Salaried Plan, we will continue to have significant obligations for pension benefits. As of December 31, 2010, our pension assets had a market value of $356 million, compared with $302 million at December 31, 2009. Assuming a return on plan assets of 7.25% in 2011 and 2012, we estimate we will be required to contribute approximately $3 million in 2011 and approximately $32 million in 2012. The amount of required contributions will depend, among other things, on actual returns on plan assets, changes in interest rates that affect our discount rate assumptions, changes in pension funding requirement laws, and modifications to our plans. Our estimates may change materially depending upon the impact of these and other factors, and the amount of our contributions may adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.
