Item 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks Associated With WashingtonFirst’s BusinessWashingtonFirst’s future success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry.WashingtonFirst faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. In particular, there is very strong competition for financial services in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which it conducts its business. WashingtonFirst competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as other kinds of local and community, super-regional, national and international financial institutions and enterprises that operate offices in its primary market areas and elsewhere. WashingtonFirst’s future growth and success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment.Many of WashingtonFirst’s competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions and many offer products and services that it does not. Many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, some operate in less stringent regulatory environments. While WashingtonFirst believes it competes effectively with these other financial institutions in its primary markets, it may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, smaller asset base, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread its marketing costs across a broader market. If WashingtonFirst has to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, its net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new or to retain existing clients may reduce or limit WashingtonFirst’s net income and its market share and may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and growth.WashingtonFirst’s profitability depends on interest rates generally, and it may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy.The economy, interest rates, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and regulatory policies have a significant influence on WashingtonFirst and the industry as a whole. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to regulate the supply of bank credit are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on borrowings from the Federal Reserve System and changes in reserve requirements with respect to deposits. These activities are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits on a national basis, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.Federal Reserve monetary policies and the fiscal policies of the federal government have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. WashingtonFirst cannot predict the nature of future monetary and fiscal policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of WashingtonFirst or its subsidiaries.WashingtonFirst’s profitability depends in substantial part on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates it receives on loans and investments and the rates it pays for deposits and other sources of funds. Its net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of its control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. In recent years, the bank’s interest income from its loan portfolio has been negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve has conveyed that it anticipates maintaining interest rates at low levels in an effort to stimulate the economy. A persistent low interest rate environment will adversely affect WashingtonFirst’s ability to earn income on loans and investments. In addition, if market interest rates change so that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it earns on loans and investments, our net income could be negatively affected.Changes in interest rates, particularly by the Federal Reserve, which implements national monetary policy in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures, also affect the value of its loans. In setting its policy, the Federal Reserve may utilize techniques such as: (i) engaging in open market transactions in United States government securities; (ii) setting the discount rate on member bank borrowings; and (iii) changing reserve requirements. These techniques may have an adverse effect on WashingtonFirst’s deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or its business and operations. The reduction by the Federal Reserve of its historic levels of securities purchases, or “tapering”, could cause the interest required to be paid by WashingtonFirst on deposits and borrowings to increase leading to a reduction in its net interest margin. In addition, an increase in interest rates could adversely affect borrowers’ ability to pay the principal or interest on existing variable rate loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money. This may lead to an increase in WashingtonFirst’s nonperforming assets, a decrease in loan originations, or a reduction in the value of and income from its loans, any of which could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst’s results of operations. WashingtonFirst tries to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk, but it is unable to completely eliminate this risk. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst’s business, financial condition and results of operations.17Table of ContentsWashingtonFirst’s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions, and may be adversely affected by reductions in Federal spending.WashingtonFirst’s success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area which are, in turn, dependent to a large extent on the Federal government, particularly its local employment and spending levels. In addition, the banking industry in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, similar to other geographic markets, is affected by general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond WashingtonFirst’s control. The adverse economic and financial conditions prevailing in the United States and in WashingtonFirst’s market area since 2008 increased the number of loan defaults and foreclosures and resulted in a decline in credit quality, which negatively impacted WashingtonFirst’s financial results. Although recent improvements have occurred, there is no assurance that these will continue. Prolonged continuation of these conditions or other economic dislocation in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including a substantial reduction in the level of employment or local spending by the Federal government, could cause increases in nonperforming assets, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity and eroding capital. For example, the reductions in Federal spending caused by a sequestration of funds, or “sequester,” could reduce and have reduced employment in the greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Temporary layoffs, salary reductions or furloughs of government employees or government contractors could have adverse impacts on other businesses in WashingtonFirst's market and the general economy of the greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area, and may indirectly lead to a loss of revenues by WashingtonFirst's customers, including vendors and lessors to the federal government and government contractors or to their employees, as well as a wide variety of commercial and retail businesses. Accordingly, sequestration could lead to increases in past due loans, nonperforming loans, loan loss reserves, and charge offs, and a decline in liquidity. WashingtonFirst cannot assure you that future adverse changes in the economy in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area would not have a material adverse effect on the WashingtonFirst’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.WashingtonFirst’s loan portfolios have significant real estate concentration.A substantial portion of WashingtonFirst’s loan portfolio is secured by real estate collateral. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 87.2 percent of WashingtonFirst’s loans had real estate as a component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. While we believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified, these concentrations expose us to the risk that a decline in the real estate market or in the economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, could increase the levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, decrease the value of collateral and reduce loan demand. In that event, WashingtonFirst’s earnings and capital could be adversely affected.Commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans tend to have larger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate and construction loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in: a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition. Further, under guidance adopted by the federal banking regulators, banks that have concentrations in construction, land development or commercial real estate loans (other than loans for majority owner occupied properties) would be expected to maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher levels of capital. We may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain as a result of our levels of construction, development and commercial real estate loans, which may require us to obtain additional capital sooner than we would otherwise seek it, which may reduce shareholder returns. WashingtonFirst’s business strategy includes the continuation of its growth plans, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if it fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively.WashingtonFirst has grown rapidly in the past several years, through acquisition and through organic growth. The Company intends to continue to grow in its existing banking markets (internally and through additional offices) and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise. WashingtonFirst’s prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are experiencing growth. WashingtonFirst cannot assure you it will be able to maintain its rate of growth, expand its market presence in its existing markets, successfully enter new markets, or that any expansion or growth will not adversely affect its results of operations. Failure to manage WashingtonFirst’s growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations, and could adversely affect its ability to successfully implement its business strategy. Also, if WashingtonFirst’s growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, its operating results could be materially affected in an adverse way.WashingtonFirst’s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in its market areas and its ability to manage its growth. While WashingtonFirst believes it has the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage its future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed. WashingtonFirst may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.18Table of ContentsAs a strategy, WashingtonFirst has sought to increase the size of the Bank by business acquisitions, and it has grown rapidly since its incorporation. WashingtonFirst may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those entities in the future. Acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks, including:•the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners;•the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target entity may not be accurate;•the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced management, opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and generating of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;•WashingtonFirst’s ability to finance an acquisition and possible ownership or economic dilution to its current shareholders;•the diversion of WashingtonFirst’s management’s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;•entry into new markets where WashingtonFirst lacks experience;•the introduction of new products and services into its business;•the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on WashingtonFirst’s results of operations; and•the potential loss of key employees and clients.WashingtonFirst may incur substantial costs to expand, and it can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits it seeks. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful. Also, WashingtonFirst may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of its common stock, in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to its current shareholders. There is no assurance that, following any future merger or acquisition, WashingtonFirst’s integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, it will achieve profits comparable to or better than its historical experience.WashingtonFirst’s allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce its earnings and capital.WashingtonFirst maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate for absorbing the estimated future losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of WashingtonFirst’s clients relative to their financial obligations with it. The amount of future losses, however, is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values, which are beyond WashingtonFirst’s control, and these future losses may exceed its current estimates. There can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the economic assumptions underlying management’s estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy on a national basis or in the Bank’s market area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. Although WashingtonFirst believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in its loan portfolio, WashingtonFirst cannot predict the amount of such losses or guarantee that its allowance will be adequate in the future. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst financial condition and results of operations.19Table of ContentsWashingtonFirst may be subject to more stringent capital requirements, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.In 2013 the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to WashingtonFirst. The final rule implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Financial Reform Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios which will be effective for WashingtonFirst on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements will be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital raio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the current rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (b) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (c) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. the new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities. In addition, the final rule provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to capital and prescribes a revised approach for risk weightings that could result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.The application of these more stringent capital requirements for WashingtonFirst could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, adversely affect WashingtonFirst’s future growth opportunities, and result in regulatory actions such as a prohibition on the payment of dividends or on the repurchase of shares if it were unable to comply with such requirements.Liquidity needs could adversely affect WashingtonFirst’s results of operations and financial condition.WashingtonFirst’s primary source of funds is client deposits in the Bank and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions. The deposits from the title and escrow agency customers that WashingtonFirst acquired in the Alliance acquisition are expected to continue to be an important component of WashingtonFirst’s deposit base. Because deposits of title and escrow agency customers are directly related to home sales and refinancing activity, any decrease in this activity would adversely impact WashingtonFirst’s deposit levels. Accordingly, WashingtonFirst may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include Federal Home Loan Bank, or “FHLB” advances, sales of securities and loans, and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, as well as out-of-market time deposits. While WashingtonFirst believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if WashingtonFirst continues to grow and experience increasing loan demand. Should such sources not be adequate, WashingtonFirst may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets.WashingtonFirst is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict its activities and adversely affect its earnings.WashingtonFirst and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not WashingtonFirst’s shareholders. These regulations affect WashingtonFirst’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on WashingtonFirst, the Bank and their respective operations.The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect WashingtonFirst’s powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on WashingtonFirst. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the WashingtonFirst’s business, financial condition and results of operations.20Table of ContentsWashingtonFirst’s recent results may not be indicative of its future results.WashingtonFirst may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow its business at all. In addition, its recent and rapid growth may distort some of its historical financial ratios and statistics. In the future, WashingtonFirst may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors, such as a generally stable interest rate environment, an improving real estate market, the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities, or the relative resistance of the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to economic downturns. Various factors, including economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit WashingtonFirst’s ability to expand its market presence. As our asset size and earnings increase, it may become more difficult to achieve high rates of increase in assets and earnings. Additionally, it may become more difficult to achieve continued improvement in our expense levels and efficiency ratio. We may not be able to maintain the relatively low levels of nonperforming assets that we have experienced. Declines in the rate of growth of income or assets or deposits, and increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may have an adverse impact on the value of the common stock. If WashingtonFirst experiences a significant decrease in its historical rate of growth, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to the fixed nature of certain operating costs.WashingtonFirst’s small to medium-sized business target market may have fewer financial resources to withstand a downturn in the economy.WashingtonFirst’s commercial development and marketing strategy targets the banking and financial services needs of small and medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the markets in which WashingtonFirst operates, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.WashingtonFirst depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, WashingtonFirst may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. WashingtonFirst also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, WashingtonFirst expects that a customer’s financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. WashingtonFirst’s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on customer-provided financial statements or other information which are discovered to be materially misleading.WashingtonFirst relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if it is forced to foreclose upon such loans.A significant portion of WashingtonFirst’s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate, 87.2 percent as of December 31, 2014. WashingtonFirst relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment which adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of WashingtonFirst’s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, WashingtonFirst may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan and may suffer a loss.WashingtonFirst is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title.In the course of its business, WashingtonFirst may foreclose and take title to real estate, potentially becoming subject to environmental liabilities associated with the properties. WashingtonFirst may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs or it may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. Costs associated with investigation or remediation activities can be substantial. If WashingtonFirst or the Bank is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect WashingtonFirst’s business.Negative public opinion could damage WashingtonFirst’s reputation and adversely impact its earnings.Reputation risk, or the risk to its business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in WashingtonFirst’s business. Negative public opinion can result from WashingtonFirst’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect WashingtonFirst’s ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose WashingtonFirst to litigation and regulatory action. Although WashingtonFirst takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with its clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of its business.21Table of ContentsWashingtonFirst depends on the services of key personnel, and a loss of any of those personnel could disrupt its operations and result in reduced revenues.WashingtonFirst’s success depends upon the continued service of its senior management team and upon its ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel. Competition for qualified employees is intense. In management’s experience, it can take a significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of professional skills and personal attributes necessary for the successful implementation of WashingtonFirst’s strategy. If WashingtonFirst loses the services of its key personnel, including key client relationship personnel, or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.WashingtonFirst depends on technology to compete effectively and may be required to make substantial investments in new technology, which could have a negative effect on WashingtonFirst’s operating results and the value of its common stock.The market for financial services, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, mobile devices, computers, automation and Internet-based banking. This is particularly true for WashingtonFirst, which relies on technology to compete in its market. WashingtonFirst depends on third party vendors for portions of its data processing services. In addition to WashingtonFirst’s ability to finance the purchase of those services and integrate them into its operations, its ability to offer new technology-based services depends on WashingtonFirst’s vendors’ abilities to provide and support those services. Future advances in technology may require WashingtonFirst to incur substantial expenses that adversely affect its operating results, and WashingtonFirst’s limited capital resources may make it impractical or impossible for it to keep pace with competitors possessing greater capital resources. WashingtonFirst’s ability to compete successfully in its banking markets may depend on the extent to which WashingtonFirst and its vendors are able to offer new technology-based services and on WashingtonFirst’s ability to integrate technological advances into its operations.WashingtonFirst’s reliance on technology exposes WashingtonFirst to cybersecurity risks.WashingtonFirst relies on digital technologies to conduct its operations, and those technologies may be compromised by the deliberate attacks by others or unintentional cybersecurity incidents. Deliberate cybersecurity attacks may seek to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Other events may not seek unauthorized access, but may seek to prevent authorized users to be able to access digital systems, referred to as “denial of service” attacks. A cybersecurity incident of this type, could require WashingtonFirst to incur substantial remediation and increased cybersecurity protection costs, such as implementing new technologies, hiring and training new employees and engaging third party experts and consultants. In addition, WashingtonFirst could become subject to litigation from customers whose sensitive data was obtained without their consent, and to damage to the company’s reputation, which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operation. From time to time, WashingtonFirst is subject to cybersecurity attacks arising in the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, there have been no cybersecurity attacks which would have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst’s financial condition, results of operation or products and services.WashingtonFirst’s operations rely on certain external vendors.WashingtonFirst’s business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support its day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. WashingtonFirst’s operations are exposed to risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in its agreements for any number of reasons including: equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or simple change in their strategic focus. While WashingtonFirst has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to WashingtonFirst’s business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.22Table of ContentsWashingtonFirst may be unable to redeem its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock before the dividend rate increases to 9%.In August 2011, WashingtonFirst elected to participate in the SBLF, and issued 17,796 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, hereafter referred to as “Series D Preferred Stock”, to the United States Treasury for $17.8 million. Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive non-cumulative cash dividends payable at the rate and in the manner prescribed in the Certificate of Designations of the Series D Preferred Stock. During the first ten quarters in which the Series D Preferred Stock was outstanding, the dividend rate was subject to fluctuation on a quarterly basis depending upon changes in the amount of WashingtonFirst’s qualified small business lending, or “QSBL,” as defined in the Supplemental Reports related to the SBLF transaction, from a “baseline” level or “QSBL Baseline.” For the second dividend period through the tenth dividend period, the annual dividend rate was 1.0 percent. Beginning with the eleventh dividend period through 4.5 years after the closing of the SBLF transaction, the annual dividend rate will be fixed at 1.0 percent.On August 15, 2014 and February 20, 2015, WashingtonFirst redeemed 4,449 shares and 4,449 shares, respectively, of the Series D Preferred Stock. Currently, 8,898 shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. On February 4, 2016, 4.5 years from the closing of the SBLF transaction will have passed, the annual dividend rate will be fixed at 9.0 percent, regardless of the level of QSBL. Depending on a variety of factors, including market conditions, WashingtonFirst’s financial condition at the time, and its ability to obtain regulatory approval, WashingtonFirst may be unable to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, and any such increases in the dividend rate could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst’s liquidity.The failure by the Bank to make payments of principal and interest on its outstanding subordinated capital notes may have negative consequences, including external involvement in the board of directors of the Bank or WashingtonFirst.On June 15, 2012, the Bank incurred $2.5 million in subordinated indebtedness, which bears interest at a rate of 8.0 percent per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Principal is due and payable in full on June 14, 2021. The subordinated capital notes are classified as Tier 2 capital by bank regulatory authorities. The Bank may call the subordinated capital notes, without penalty, at any time after June 15, 2015. The notes are the subordinated unsecured obligations of the Bank and are not guaranteed by WashingtonFirst. For so long as the notes qualify as Tier 2 capital under applicable banking regulations, the notes will be subordinate to all deposits and general creditors of the Bank. In connection with the issuance of the subordinated capital notes, WashingtonFirst issued a warrant to purchase 60,657 shares of common stock to the lender, exercisable at $10.30 per share, subject to adjustment.If the Bank fails to make any payment due under the subordinated capital notes or the warrant for a period of 30 days, or the ratio of classified assets to Tier 1 capital of the Bank is 40 percent or greater, the holder of the notes is entitled (subject to any prior required regulatory approval) to appoint an observer to attend the meetings of the boards of directors of WashingtonFirst and the Bank and any board committees. If WashingtonFirst’s failure to pay such amounts extends for a period of 120 days, or the ratio of classified assets to Tier 1 capital of the Bank is 70 percent or greater, then subject to any prior regulatory approval the holder of the notes shall be entitled to appoint one representative of the holder to the board of directors of either WashingtonFirst or the Bank. Once appointed, such observer or representative shall remain on the board until the expiration of 12 months after payment of all amounts due, or the reduction of the ratio to less than 40 percent or 70 percent, as the case may be.23Table of ContentsRisks Associated with WashingtonFirst’s Common StockAn active liquid trading market for WashingtonFirst’s common stock may not develop and WashingtonFirst’s stock price may be volatile.WashingtonFirst’s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or the “NASDAQ,” on December 24, 2012. However, an active and liquid trading market for WashingtonFirst’s common stock may not develop or be maintained. Liquid and active trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors’ purchase and sale orders. The market price of WashingtonFirst’s common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond WashingtonFirst’s control.The following factors could affect WashingtonFirst’s stock price:•WashingtonFirst’s operating and financial performance;•quarterly variations in the rate of growth of WashingtonFirst’s financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;•strategic actions by WashingtonFirst’s competitors;•changes in WashingtonFirst’s revenue or earnings estimates;•publication of reports or changes or withdrawals of research coverage by equity research analysts;•speculation in the press or investment community;•sales of WashingtonFirst’s common stock by WashingtonFirst, members of its board of directors or management, or the perception that such sales may occur;•changes in accounting principles;•additions or departures of key management personnel;•actions by WashingtonFirst’s shareholders;•general market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates; and•domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to WashingtonFirst’s performance.The stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of WashingtonFirst’s common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against WashingtonFirst, could result in very substantial costs, divert WashingtonFirst’s management’s attention and resources and harm WashingtonFirst’s business, operating results and financial condition.24Table of ContentsWashingtonFirst is a relatively small public company, and compliance with the increased regulatory and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain its resources, increase its costs and distract management; and WashingtonFirst may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.As a public company with listed equity securities, WashingtonFirst is required to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, including corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act,” related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NASDAQ. Amongst other things, WashingtonFirst is required to:•design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;•design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures to ensure the information required to be disclosed in its filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner;•comply with enhanced corporate governance requirements and other rules promulgated by the NASDAQ;•prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with WashingtonFirst’s obligations under the federal securities laws;•establish new internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;•involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and•enhance its investor relations function.Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupy a significant amount of time of WashingtonFirst’s board of directors and management and significantly increase its costs and expenses.WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation and bylaws and Virginia law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of WashingtonFirst’s common stock.Some provisions of WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of WashingtonFirst, even if the change of control would be beneficial to and desirable by WashingtonFirst’s shareholders, including:•a staggered board of directors;•the ability of the WashingtonFirst board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which preferred stock could have voting, liquidation, dividend or other rights superior to those of the WashingtonFirst common stock;•the inability of WashingtonFirst shareholders to act without a meeting except by unanimous written consent;•the inability of WashingtonFirst shareholders to call special meetings;•limitations on affiliated transactions and control share acquisitions;•if a two-thirds majority of the WashingtonFirst board of directors has not approved certain transactions, such as an amendment to the WashingtonFirst articles of incorporation, merger, share exchange, sale of substantially all of the assets, or dissolution, the transaction must receive the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of each voting group of WashingtonFirst shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction for the transaction to be approved; and•the WashingtonFirst bylaws provide that the WashingtonFirst bylaws may be amended by the WashingtonFirst board of directors.25Table of ContentsThe Virginia Stock Corporation Act, or “VSCA” contains provisions governing “affiliated transactions.” These include various transactions such as mergers, share exchanges, sales, leases, exchanges, mortgages, pledges, transfers or other material dispositions of assets, issuances of securities, dissolutions, and similar transactions with an “interested shareholder.” An interested shareholder is generally the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of a corporation’s outstanding voting shares. During the three years following the date a shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, any affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder must be approved by both a majority of the “disinterested directors” (those directors who were directors before the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder or who were recommended for election by a majority of disinterested directors) and by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the corporation’s voting shares other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. These requirements do not apply to affiliated transactions if, among other things, a majority of the disinterested directors approve the interested shareholder’s acquisition of voting shares making such a person an interested shareholder before such acquisition. Beginning three years after the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the corporation may engage in an affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder if:•the transaction is approved by the holders of two-thirds of the corporation’s voting shares, other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder;•the affiliated transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or•subject to certain additional requirements, in the affiliated transaction the holders of each class or series of voting shares will receive consideration meeting specified fair price and other requirements designed to ensure that all shareholders receive fair and equivalent consideration, regardless of when they tendered their shares.Under the VSCA’s control share acquisitions law, voting rights of shares of stock of a Virginia corporation acquired by an acquiring person or other entity at ownership levels of 20 percent, 33 1/3 percent and 50 percent of the outstanding shares may, under certain circumstances, be denied. The voting rights may be denied:•unless conferred by a special shareholder vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, other than shares held by the acquiring person and officers and directors of the corporation; or•among other exceptions, such acquisition of shares is made pursuant to an affiliation agreement with the corporation or the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws permit the acquisition of such shares before the acquiring person’s acquisition thereof.If authorized in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, the statute also permits the corporation to redeem the acquired shares at the average per share price paid for them if the voting rights are not approved or if the acquiring person does not file a “control share acquisition statement” with the corporation within 60 days of the last acquisition of such shares. If voting rights are approved for control shares comprising more than 50 percent of the corporation’s outstanding stock, objecting shareholders may have the right to have their shares repurchased by the corporation for “fair value.”These provisions are only applicable to public corporations that have more than 300 shareholders, and, therefore, have only recently become applicable to WashingtonFirst. Corporations may provide in their articles of incorporation or bylaws to opt-out of these provisions, but WashingtonFirst has not done so.Future sales of WashingtonFirst’s common stock in the public market could lower its stock price, and any additional capital raised by WashingtonFirst through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.On December 30, 2014, WashingtonFirst entered into separate Investment Agreements (the “Investment Agreements”) with six institutional accredited investors (collectively, the “Investors”) relating to the sale by WashingtonFirst of an aggregate of 710,553 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), and an aggregate of 666,666 shares of non-voting common stock, series A, $0.01 par value per share (the “Series A Stock”), at a price of $15.00 per share (the "Private Placement"). Each of the Investors was an existing shareholder of WashingtonFirst. WashingtonFirst received aggregate gross proceeds from the Investors of $20,658,285. WashingtonFirst also entered into a Registration Right Agreement with all of the Investors who purchased Common Stock in the Private Placement pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC within forty-five (45) days of the closing of the Private Placement for purposes of registering the resale of the shares of the Common Stock issued in the Private Placement.WashingtonFirst may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public or private offerings or otherwise issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock in the future. WashingtonFirst has filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of WashingtonFirst’s common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the WashingtonFirst 2010 Equity Compensation Plan and predecessor WashingtonFirst incentive plans. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, shares registered under WashingtonFirst’s registration statement on Form S-8 will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.26Table of ContentsWashingtonFirst cannot predict the size of future issuances of its common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of its common stock will have on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of WashingtonFirst’s common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of WashingtonFirst’s common stock.The concentration of WashingtonFirst’s capital stock ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.As of March 5, 2015, the record date for purposes of the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, WashingtonFirst’s directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own approximately 25.91 percent of WashingtonFirst’s outstanding common stock and options exercisable within sixty days. Consequently, WashingtonFirst’s board of directors has significant influence over all matters that require approval by WashingtonFirst’s shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters.WashingtonFirst’s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions, and it may be unable to pay future cash dividends.WashingtonFirst’s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory, statutory and contractual restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient capital. Its only source of funds with which to pay dividends to its shareholders are dividends received from the Bank, and the Bank’s ability to pay dividends is limited by its own obligations to maintain sufficient capital and regulatory restrictions. If these regulatory requirements are not satisfied, WashingtonFirst will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock. The Company commenced paying cash dividends in 2014 and has paid a dividend of four cents ($0.04) per share -- on the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock and Series A non-voting common stock -- on January 2, April 1, July 1 and October 1, 2014. In the fourth quarter 2014, the Company increased the quarterly cash dividend to five cents ($0.05) per share, which was paid January 2, 2015. Future cash dividend payments and common stock repurchases are subject to certain restrictions by the terms of the Secretary of the Treasury’s equity investment in WashingtonFirst.Under the terms of the SBLF, for so long as any preferred stock issued under the SBLF remains outstanding, WashingtonFirst is prohibited from making a cash dividend payment or share repurchase if, after the payment or repurchase, its Tier 1 capital would not be at least 90 percent of the amount existing at the time immediately after August 4, 2011, excluding any subsequent net charge-offs and partial repayments of the SBLF funding. This 90 percent limitation will decrease by a dollar amount equal to 10.0 percent of the SBLF funding for every 1.0 percent increase in QSBL that WashingtonFirst has achieved over the QSBL Baseline. These restrictions will no longer apply to WashingtonFirst after it has repaid the SBLF funding in full.27Table of ContentsItem 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.
