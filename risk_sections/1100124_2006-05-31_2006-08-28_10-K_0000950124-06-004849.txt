Overview Celebrate Express is a leading provider of celebration products serving families with young children, via the Internet and catalogs. We currently operate two brands, Birthday Express and Costume Express, which respectively offer high-quality childrens party products and childrens costumes and accessories. In the beginning of fiscal 2007, we started the process of winding down the operations of our Storybook Heirlooms brand, which offered girls special occasion and specialty apparel. Our marketing strategy utilizes our branded websites, complemented by our branded catalogs, to offer products as completely coordinated assortments. We support our customers purchasing experience with detailed product information, knowledgeable event planning advice and responsive customer service. Our goal is to help busy parents celebrate the special moments in their childrens lives. Our brands were built around the concept of offering a complete accessorized product assortment for the celebration needs of families with young children. We began with our Birthday Express brand, which offers customers over 150 childrens party themes. Each party theme encompasses the products and information necessary to help busy parents create a memorable birthday celebration. Our Costume Express brand offers an assortment of high-quality childrens costumes for Halloween and a variety of dress-up occasions. Offering multiple brands has allowed us to leverage our product development expertise, sourcing capabilities, inventory management skills and customer database to increase our revenue. Our business model offers proprietary products, which serve to differentiate us from competitors and provide a margin advantage relative to our other products, as well as third-party products, which allow us to capitalize on market trends. We offer a broad assortment of products in one convenient location, eliminating time-consuming steps required to purchase products at multiple store locations. Our centralized inventory management maximizes product availability and allows us to customize product packages. Additionally, our ability to design, manufacture or directly source many of our products allows us to develop creative proprietary products and quickly react to consumer trends. We believe that the combination of these factors creates a more appealing shopping experience than traditional retail stores. In fiscal 2006, we generated $87.0 million in net sales, an increase of 25.9% from $69.1 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, our Birthday Express brand accounted for approximately 79% of our revenue and our websites represented our fastest growing sales channel comprising approximately 69% of net sales. In the same period, our net sales per order was $82.12 and more than 46% of our sales came from repeat customers. Our Approach We believe our direct-to-consumer model, utilizing the Internet and catalogs, offers a more compelling shopping experience by providing a comprehensive assortment of products and accessories, supported by helpful 3 Table of Contents information and advice. We also believe our model allows us to offer a more efficient and complete experience, leading to increased customer loyalty and repeat purchases. In recent years, we have added brands and product categories to augment our business where we feel we can improve a customers overall experience and capture an increasing share of their discretionary spending. Key attributes of our approach include: Broad Merchandising Assortment We offer a broad mix of proprietary and third-party products. Our proprietary products are internally designed and are either manufactured by us, or manufactured exclusively for us. These proprietary products serve to differentiate us from competitors, create product continuity from year to year and provide an opportunity for increased margins relative to our other products. In addition, we purchase products from third-party suppliers in order to add popular products and styles to our offerings. For example, we believe that our Birthday Express party assortment is larger and more diverse than those typically found in a traditional retail store. We offer more than 150 themes, over 50 of which are exclusive or proprietary designs. Each of our proprietary and third-party themes has an extensive selection of as many as 40 coordinated party products. We have implemented a similar merchandising strategy in our Costume Express brand by offering customers complete proprietary and third-party ensembles. Our Costume Express brand offers a broad assortment of approximately 400 quality costumes, most of which are available with coordinated accessories. For example, customers shopping for a pirate costume can also purchase an earring, eye patch, three-corner hat, hook, sword, stuffed parrot and telescope. Comprehensive Product Information We offer extensive product information and support to provide a more personalized and informed purchasing experience. Detailed Online Information. Each of our branded websites offers extensive product information and advice. For example, at Birthday Express, each themed product web page presents a variety of products and suggestions for additional theme-related items such as personalized banners, party activities and favors. Each web page also includes a custom party-planning guide offering theme-specific tips, such as games, recipes, themed cake suggestions, as well as product reviews from customers. Knowledgeable Online and Phone Sales Staff. We conduct extensive training, monitoring and evaluation to ensure that our customer support team exhibits a consistently high level of product knowledge and professionalism across all our brands. Our customer support team for Birthday Express consists of trained party planners who are available to process orders, help with age-appropriate theme and activity selection and offer party planning ideas and advice. We offer an online chat feature on every product web page that allows customers to access real-time answers from trained planners. Our Costume Express brand is supported by the same customer support representatives who are able to offer customers detailed accessory, sizing, fabric content and care information. We believe that the information and advice provided by our websites and customer support team not only saves our customers time, but also gives them confidence in their purchases and in the planning of their celebration. We also believe that this contributes to increased customer loyalty and repeat purchases over time. Convenient Shopping Environment By offering a broad selection of products, advice and information in one convenient location, we seek to reduce our customers shopping time and stress. We believe consumers cannot find as extensive a selection of coordinating products at traditional retailers. We believe that in order to create a celebration with the same level of accessorization, the customer would have to travel to multiple locations and spend a considerable amount of time shopping for items, as well as researching the celebratory event details. In addition to one-stop-shopping, our websites and catalogs provide an opportunity for children to browse our products and participate in the selection process, saving parents the inconvenience of taking their children to multiple stores. Our online stores are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 4 Table of Contents Product Availability and Customization We are not limited by the same shelf space and store layout constraints as a traditional retailer, and as a result, we are able to offer a greater variety of products. We manage our inventory from a single centralized location. We believe our centralized inventory enables us to provide a large number of products and related accessories while maintaining higher product in-stock rates, thereby improving a customers shopping experience. For example, in our Birthday Express brand we currently offer over 150 themes, with as many as 40 accessories per theme. We offer our products individually and in themed party packages from Basic to Ultimate, and we customize each package. We believe that giving customers the freedom to customize orders saves the customer money, reduces waste and contributes to a more satisfying shopping experience. Rapid Time to Market We believe our ability to quickly respond to changing consumer demand with new products, allows us to improve our customers overall shopping experience. We carefully analyze our customers buying patterns and we use these results to guide our merchandising strategy. Our online sales channel allows us the flexibility to bring products to market rapidly and to continually refine our merchandising assortment based on demand. For example, in our Birthday Express brand, we can go from concept to launch of a new theme in less than eight weeks or replenish existing paper goods in as little as 48 hours. Our internal design, product development, manufacturing and sourcing capabilities allow us to produce small quantities of new products, test them and, if appropriate, quickly expand the product assortment to better meet the needs of our customers. Our Growth Strategy Our goal is to become the leading multi-brand destination for celebration products, merchandised as complete solutions, serving families with young children. Key elements of our strategy include: Build Brand Awareness and Expand Our Customer Base We plan to continue to use a variety of online and print marketing strategies to target families with young children. We drive traffic to our websites and customer support center primarily through the use of catalogs, outbound email, search marketing and web-based affiliate programs. By increasing consumer awareness, we are making our branded websites a popular destination on the Internet. We also believe that word of mouth advertising is an important source of new customer acquisition and that many of our customers were introduced to our brands while attending celebrations featuring our products. Our direct marketing model utilizing branded websites and catalogs allows us to cost-effectively build our brand awareness and expand our customer database. In our fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, we added approximately 560,000 new customers to our database, an increase of 35% over the 415,000 new customers added during our fiscal year ended May 31, 2005. As of May 31, 2006, our customer database totaled over 2.8 million customers. Continue to Add New Brands We continuously evaluate the potential to develop or acquire new brands in attractive product categories in an effort to better serve our customers. During fiscal 2004, we added the Costume Express brand via internal development. The addition of this brand has allowed us to use our customer database to generate sales and increase order frequency. For our fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, our Costume Express brand accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales. Increase Sales Per Customer We plan to increase our sales per customer by increasing both the frequency of purchase and net sales per order. We believe establishing a long-term relationship with our customer is key to driving frequent purchases. By offering new brands, such as Costume Express, we have increased the number of occasions for which our customers can purchase our products. We also employ a number of strategies to increase net sales per order, including offering an expanded assortment of products and accessories. 5 Table of Contents Expand Our Product Offerings We plan to continue to expand our proprietary and third-party offerings within each of our brands. Our product design team is continually creating and sourcing new themes and products to respond to changes in customer tastes. The online nature of our business allows us to cost-efficiently add new products to our overall assortment. Our Brands and Product Offerings We offer our celebration products through the following brands: Birthday Express We launched our Birthday Express brand to provide childrens party solutions utilizing a catalog in June 1994 and a website in April 1996. We currently offer over 150 birthday party themes that include a mix of third-party and proprietary products. Our third-party properties include popular themes such as Disney Princesses, Cars and Thomas the Tank Engine. Our proprietary themes are based on either licenses, such as The DOG, Tony Hawk and LEGO, or internally developed childrens themes such as fire trucks, construction equipment, and horses. Within each theme we offer as many as 40 high-quality, theme-coordinated party products. In addition to the usual paper products for parties, such as plates, cups, napkins, tablecloths and invitations, we provide a broad assortment of proprietary accessories such as piñatas, party hats, activity kits and crafts, costumes, banners and distinctive favor-filled boxes. Our products can be bought individually or in cost-saving Basic, Deluxe and Ultimate packages ranging in price from approximately $21 to $200. Costume Express We tested Costume Express as a separate brand through a website and catalog in Fall 2003 and based on its performance, we rolled out this brand in Fall 2004. Costume Express grew organically out of our costume offerings in our Birthday Express and Storybook Heirlooms brands and now includes approximately 400 costumes for Halloween and other year-round dress-up occasions. We also offer a variety of add-on accessories that enhance the total costume and allow the customer to choose the completeness of the look. While we carry some third-party costumes such as Kim Possible, Batman and Elmo to capture current trends, we also generate roughly 40% of our revenues in Costume Express from our own proprietary designs. Costumes with timeless, broad appeal such as princesses, divas, hippies, witches and mermaids, provide us with a stable product assortment that we can market year after year. Our proprietary costumes use high-quality fabric, design and construction, which distinguishes us from mass merchandisers. Our costumes range in price from approximately $24 for a basic costume to more than $150 for a completely accessorized costume. Storybook Heirlooms We acquired the Storybook Heirlooms brand in April 2001. Due to various challenges with the brand and the girls apparel market, we decided to begin an orderly wind-down of our Storybook brand at the beginning of fiscal 2007. The Company will continue to operate the brand in fiscal 2007 through sale efforts to sell through the existing inventory. We will then re-focus Company resources on our faster growing Birthday Express and Costume Express brands. Product Development and Sourcing Proprietary products are the focus of our merchandising assortment for each of our brands, producing a majority of our corporate revenue. These products allow us to differentiate our offerings from those of our competition and respond quickly to market trends. They also have typically provided us with better margins and often have more longevity than third-party products and themes. Proprietary products are designed and developed by our in-house staff, including individuals who specialize in graphic art, sculpture, production and sourcing. Additionally, we utilize freelance design resources as needed. Our proprietary products are either manufactured by us or manufactured exclusively for us. We obtain our costumes and non-paper products directly from a diverse network of over 200 manufacturers and distributors throughout 6 Table of Contents North America, Europe and Asia. We believe sourcing our products directly from manufacturers allows us to eliminate traditional supply chain intermediaries and thus more effectively reduce costs, monitor product quality and coordinate selections to match our themed packages. Third-party products are also key to each of our brands because they allow customers to purchase products based on current trends. Our merchandisers gain insight into market trends through their relationships with key suppliers and by traveling to tradeshows to find new products. We are often able to purchase popular products from third-party suppliers at discounts based on our volumes and reorder, as needed, to meet our customers demand. In our Birthday Express and Costume Express brands, this strategy allows us to offer current products such as Darth Vader and Dora the Explorer, without incurring the significant financial investment and risk that comes from pursuing such large and visible licenses. In our fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, products supplied by our ten largest suppliers represented 35.0% of our inventory purchases. Marketing and Customer Acquisition Our marketing strategy utilizes both online and print marketing programs to acquire and retain customers. Our integrated in-house team of web developers, graphic artists and copywriters make use of our digital studio to design and create our websites and catalogs. By designing and creating our marketing materials in-house, we are able to maintain quality control and shorten production lead-times. Our websites and catalogs use photographic themes and detailed product descriptions, and prominently feature our most popular products. Our marketing and merchandising departments work together to determine the placement and presentation of merchandise on our websites and in our catalogs. We intend to continue growing our customer base through targeted marketing programs. We continually evaluate our marketing strategies to maximize their effectiveness and return on investment. Online Marketing and Promotion. We utilize numerous online marketing methods to reach our current and potential customers and generate traffic on our websites. The most significant programs include:  Email Marketing  Search Marketing  Affiliates Program Offline Marketing and Promotion. Our catalogs remain our primary advertising and marketing vehicle. Our branded catalogs showcase our best-selling party products and costumes and help to generate interest in our broader online offerings. We also occasionally market our products through direct marketing insert programs. Customer Support Offering a high level of customer support is a key part of our strategy. We provide online information resources along with knowledgeable, highly trained support staff in order to retain and expand our customer base. Online Customer Support. Our websites organize our products into easy-to-navigate departments. A customer can shop through three convenient methods: traditional online shopping, electronic order form, or by virtually paging through an online catalog. We offer online help through our live chat function on every web page, so customers can easily receive immediate interactive assistance from our trained customer support representatives. Our shopping cart features an easy two-step checkout process. Online support continues after an order is placed, with an email confirmation sent within minutes, and shipment confirmation that enables customers to track their order status. Additionally, each branded website has certain customized features. For example, the Birthday Express website offers tools designed to facilitate the theme selection and party-planning process. Customer Support Center. Our customer support staff receives extensive training across each brands product offering upon joining the organization, followed by monthly hands-on training. This knowledge base allows them to work confidently with the customer to build a complete party package or accessorized outfit. We regularly monitor calls to ensure consistent service levels, and our mentoring program is designed to improve sales skills. We continue to invest in training and technology to ensure that our customer support staff has the necessary tools and knowledge to provide a positive customer shopping experience. Call center staffing is managed with the help of workforce software that allows us to answer over 85% of customer calls on the first ring. When we receive unexpectedly high 7 Table of Contents call volume, customers holding longer than one minute are offered an automatic call-back option in which the system accurately quotes an estimated number of minutes until the return phone call, holds the customers place in line and serves the return call to the next available customer support representative. We have also implemented an incoming call recognition system to automatically populate customer information onto the order entry screen, which saves time and increases order accuracy. Each customer support staff member has real-time access to extensive product information via our internal customer support website. This serves to increase efficiency and improve the customer shopping experience. Our customer support representatives are available for online and phone support weekdays from 4:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and weekends from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Pacific time. Fulfillment and Shipping We believe that order fulfillment procedures, distribution center location and customized software to manage the pick, pack and ship order process are key elements of our strategy. Our fulfillment and distribution center is in Greensboro, North Carolina. Our Greensboro facility operates 24 hours a day during weekdays, to ensure that orders are processed on a continuous basis. Our customized fulfillment software enables us to pick, pack and ship orders in packages and sets, which under our Birthday Express brand involves an average of 15 picks consisting of over 100 individual components. We are in the process of upgrading our distribution center procedures to enhance efficiencies and provide further scalability for growth. We are now utilizing pick-to-light technology to pick the Birthday Express orders, and intend to make additional investments to further automate and enhance functionality in our replenishment and packaging operations. We have experienced difficulties in our distribution center and have incurred higher than anticipated costs related to the transition to the pick-to-light technology in fiscal 2006. The additional costs are primarily increases in labor, overtime and temporary labor costs incurred to ship customer orders. As we anticipate additional investments and procedural changes will be made to improve the distribution center throughout fiscal 2007, we expect that we will continue to incur costs associated with the transition to and implementation of these improvements. Our distribution center is located close to key third-party shipping distribution hubs. This has enabled us to lower our shipping costs and provide faster delivery time to customers. We offer our customers overnight, two-day, four-day and ground delivery and utilize third-party shippers including United Parcel Service of America, Inc., United States Postal Service and Federal Express Corporation. Technology Systems Our order processing, fulfillment, customer support, inventory, merchandising and financial reporting systems utilize a combination of proprietary and licensed software. We concentrate our software development efforts on creating and enhancing the features and functionality of our websites and order processing and fulfillment systems to deliver a high-quality customer experience. Our websites include proprietary product search technology, customized web pages and several customer shopping cart and checkout alternatives. Our websites use secure encryption technology to send, receive and store customer information, including credit card information. We utilize licensed software and internally developed customer support enhancement features to manage our ordering processes. Our websites are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week with minimal downtime required for maintenance. Our websites are maintained in our secure data center in Kirkland, Washington. This location provides us both website and web server redundancy. Our data center is also equipped with redundant network connections, emergency power backup systems and firewall software. We utilize tape backup systems for all our servers and software. We currently store our customer database on concurrently running servers. 8 Table of Contents Competition We operate in several highly competitive markets including party goods and childrens costumes. Our primary competition comes from traditional retailers that offer a variety of products in the party products and apparel spaces. Competitors can enter our market with little difficulty and can launch new websites or catalogs at relatively low cost. We believe our primary competition in party goods and costumes is from mass merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart and party goods superstores such as Party City and Party America. We also compete with a variety of other companies including: online retailers of party goods; traditional card and gift specialty retailers; supermarkets and drugstores; and catalog retailers of novelty items. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are brand recognition, product selection, availability and quality, convenience, customer support and price as well as accurate and timely order fulfillment and delivery. Many of our current and potential competitors may have the ability to devote substantially more resources to marketing, customer support, product development and order fulfillment operations than we can. Some of our suppliers also may choose to compete directly with us and may in the future not supply product to us. In addition, larger and more well-financed entities may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors. Some of our competitors may be able to secure products from suppliers on more favorable terms, fulfill orders more efficiently and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. Intellectual Property We regard our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. Birthday Express and BirthdayExpress.com are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office, and we have filed federal trademark applications for Costume Express and Celebrate Express. Our outstanding trademark applications may not be allowed. Even if these applications are allowed, they may not provide us a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our business or brands, or the products we make or use infringe upon their rights. We believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party. However, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. We also rely on technologies and designs developed and licensed from third parties. These licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms in the future. Our design licenses, which include licensed trademarks and copyrights, are limited in scope, generally have two- or three-year terms and do not provide automatic renewal rights. Moreover, most of these licenses may be terminated immediately if we breach their terms. The loss of existing technology licenses could harm the performance of our existing services until equivalent technology can be identified, obtained and integrated. Failure to obtain new technology licenses may result in delays or reductions in the introduction of new features, functions or services, which could harm our business. Further, third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to our use of current or future technologies, whether developed by us or licensed from third parties. Although there are currently no material pending claims of infringement against us and we are not aware of any material claims that may be brought against us, third parties may in the future claim that the sale of one or more of our product offerings infringes their intellectual property rights. We expect that the continued growth of the Internet will result in an increasing number of infringement claims as legal standards related to our market continue to evolve. Any such claim, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service upgrade delays, cause us to discontinue the availability of a particular product offering or discontinue use of a particular technology, require us to pay damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to 9 Table of Contents us or at all. As a result, any such claim of infringement against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Government Regulation We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses generally or directly applicable to retailing or online commerce. However, as the Internet becomes increasingly popular, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Further, the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the U.S. and abroad. Regulations imposed by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, may adversely affect the growth of our business or our marketing efforts. The FTC has adopted regulations regarding the collection, maintenance, dissemination and use of personal identifying information obtained from individuals when accessing websites. These regulations include requirements that we establish procedures to disclose and notify users of privacy and security policies, obtain consent from users for collection and use of information and provide users with the ability to access, correct and delete personal information stored by us. They also contain specific parental consent provisions with respect to collecting information from children. These regulations also include enforcement and redress provisions. In addition, the FTC has conducted investigations into the privacy practices of companies that collect information on the Internet. We may become subject to the FTCs regulatory and enforcement efforts with respect to current regulations or future regulations, or those of other governmental bodies, which may adversely affect our ability to collect demographic and personal information from users and our ability to email users, which could adversely affect our marketing efforts. We also may be subject to regulation not specifically related to the Internet, including laws affecting direct marketers and advertisers. The adoption of or modification of laws applicable to Internet advertising, marketing or data collection could affect our ability to market our products, decrease the demand for our products, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are not certain how our business may be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity, qualification to do business and export or import matters. Most of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Changes in laws intended to address these issues could create uncertainty for those conducting online commerce. This uncertainty could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased fulfillment costs. In addition, because our products and services are available over the Internet in multiple states, certain states may claim that we are required to qualify to do business and collect sales tax from our customers located in those states. Currently, we are qualified to do business only in Washington and North Carolina. Our failure to qualify to do business in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties. It could also hamper our ability to enforce contracts in these jurisdictions. Additionally, we do not currently collect or have imposed upon us sales, use or other taxes related to the products we sell, except for certain corporate-level taxes and sales taxes with respect to purchases by customers located in the states of North Carolina and Washington. However, one or more states may seek to impose sales, use and other tax collection obligations on us in the future. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should be collecting sales, use or other taxes on the sale of our products could result in substantial tax liabilities and penalties in connection with past sales. The application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business could harm our business and results of operations. 10 Table of Contents Employees As of May 31, 2006, we had 456 full and part-time employees, including 129 in customer support, 47 in marketing and merchandising, 18 in technology and information systems, 246 in distribution and manufacturing and 16 in administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results You should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. We achieved annual net income for the first time during our fiscal year ended May 31, 2004 and we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate profitably. We achieved an annual net income for the first time in our corporate history during our fiscal year ended May 31, 2004. In the three months periods ended February 28, 2006 and May 31, 2006, we had net losses of $398,000 and $324,000, respectively. Prior to fiscal 2004 we have had a history of losses. We may incur losses again in our current or future fiscal years, especially as we introduce new products. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future, as we, among other things:  expand into new product categories;  continue with our marketing efforts to build our brand names;  expand our customer base;  upgrade our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls;  invest in and upgrade our distribution center; and  retain existing personnel and hire additional personnel, including senior leadership. In order to maintain profitability as we expand into new product categories, we will need to generate sales exceeding historical levels and/or reduce relative operating expenditures. We may not be able to generate the required sales from our current or new product categories or reduce operating expenses sufficiently to sustain or increase operating profitability. If we have a shortfall in sales without a corresponding reduction to our expenses, our operating results will suffer. It is possible that results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. If we do not successfully expand sales into other product categories beyond party goods, we may not be able to achieve our desired revenue growth. We were incorporated and began selling party products through our direct marketing catalog in June 1994 and on our www.BirthdayExpress.com website in April 1996. In April 2001, we acquired certain assets of Storybook Inc., a direct marketer of girls specialty and special occasion apparel. In February 2002, we re-launched the Storybook Heirlooms brand and the website www.Storybook.com. Revenue growth from our Storybook Heirlooms brand has historically not met management expectations, which in part, resulted in the Companys decision in June 2006 to wind-down the operations of the brand. In September 2003, we launched our website www.Costumeexpress.com and catalog for Costume Express, a provider of childrens and family costumes. We have historically derived more than 75% of our annual revenues from the sale of party products and accessories to families with young children under our Birthday Express brand. In order to achieve the desired growth in our sales and business, we will need to expand into 11 Table of Contents new product categories. Challenges that may affect our ability to expand into new product categories include our ability to:  improve the efficiency of our distribution center;  successfully design, produce and market new products;  identify and introduce new product categories;  maintain our gross margins with respect to new product categories;  provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise that is responsive to the needs of our customers;  broaden consumer awareness of our existing and future brands;  manage our selling, marketing and fulfillment costs; and  manage our dual-channel direct marketing model. In addition, we may experience a higher degree of seasonality in our business as we expand our brands or expand into new brands or product categories that have seasonal significance. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. Our evaluation of strategic alternatives may negatively impact business operations and our assets. On August 21, 2006, we announced that we engaged an investment banker to assist us in a review of our strategic alternatives including a sale of the company. As this review is in its early stages, we are uncertain as to what strategic alternatives may be available to us, whether we will elect to pursue any such strategic alternatives, or what impact any particular strategic alternative will have on our stock price if pursued. There are various uncertainties and risks relating to our exploration of strategic alternatives, including:  exploration of strategic alternatives may distract management and disrupt operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results;  we may not be able to successfully achieve the benefits of any strategic alternative undertaken by us;  the process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and expensive and may result in the loss of business opportunities; and  perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in increased difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees, particularly senior management. If the exploration of strategic alternatives does result in a transaction, we are unable to predict what the market prices of our common stock would be after the announcement of such a transaction. In addition, the market price of our stock could be highly volatile for several months as we explore strategic alternatives and may continue to be more volatile if and when a transaction is announced or we announce that we are no longer exploring strategic alternatives. The loss of our senior management or other key personnel could harm our current and future operations and prospects. Our performance is substantially dependent on the services of our senior management and other key personnel, particularly, Kevin Green, our Chief Executive Officer, and Darin White, our Vice President Finance. Several of our former officers, including Michael Jewell, former President and Chief Executive Officer, Louis Usarzewicz, Executive Vice President Operations, Lori Liddle, Chief Marketing and Merchandising Officer, and Allen McDowell, Vice President of Information Systems departed from Celebrate Express in the recent past. These departures have had an adverse impact on our operations and financial results. We cannot assure you that the continued absence of senior management will not further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recruiting new senior management has taken longer than we would have anticipated, and we expect that recruiting will become more difficult and expensive given our recent announcement concerning exploration of strategic alternatives. 12 Table of Contents Our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our officers and key employees. We do not have employment agreements with our key personnel except Mr. Green. The loss of the services of Mr. Green or Mr. White or any of our other key employees for any reason could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain, and motivate senior management and other technical, managerial, editorial, merchandising, marketing, and customer support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Failure to successfully manage our fulfillment and distribution operations could cause us to incur increased costs or lose customers. Our fulfillment and distribution operations are located in Greensboro, North Carolina. These operations are critical to the cost-effective and efficient fulfillment and shipment of customer orders. We are making modifications to our distribution center to accommodate more streamlined distribution procedures. The Company has incurred higher than anticipated costs in implementing these procedures, as well as, higher fulfillment costs related to the Companys transition to a more automated order picking process. As a result, for fiscal 2006, fulfillment costs increased to 13.4% of net sales, compared with 11.6% in fiscal 2005. These increased costs contributed significantly to our net loss in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006. We expect that we will continue to incur higher expenses and additional costs throughout fiscal 2007 as we make further improvements in our fulfillment and distribution operations. Failure to correct the issues in our distribution facility, or to successfully implement the new distribution processes, could continue to result in delays in fulfillment and shipment of customer orders, which will in turn increase our costs more than we anticipate and might hurt our reputation and discourage repeat sales. If we are unable to successfully remedy our fulfillment difficulties or manage our fulfillment and distribution operations, we could also incur increased costs to fulfill customer orders for longer than anticipated, or may be required to find one or more parties to provide these services for us. As our operations grow in size and scope, we will need to improve, upgrade and increase the capacity of our fulfillment and distribution center systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our fulfillment and distribution systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance of a corresponding increase in sales. If we cannot expand our distribution center or move to a larger distribution center in advance of increased customer demand, we could experience increased expenses and lower customer satisfaction. Any of these problems could impair our reputation, damage our brands and cause our sales to decline. We must compete with other party goods retailers and mass merchandisers on the selection, quality and price of our products, and failure to do so successfully could negatively affect our stock price. In order to meet our strategic goals, we must successfully offer, on a continuous basis, a broad selection of appealing products to families with young children. To successfully compete against other party goods retailers and mass merchandisers, our product offerings must be affordable, high-quality, innovative and attractive to a wide range of consumers whose preferences may change from time to time. We cannot predict with certainty that we will be successful in offering products that meet these requirements. If consumers do not find our products attractive or our products otherwise become less popular with consumers, we may see increased merchandise returns, inventory write-downs and increased costs. Any shortcomings in our merchandise strategy could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. Childrens tastes change and are often difficult to predict, and any failure by us to correctly identify and react appropriately to these changing preferences could hurt our sales and gross margins and render a portion of our inventory obsolete. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer demand could lead to excess inventories and significant markdowns or a shortage of products and lost sales. Our strategy, relations with our customers and margins are dependent, in part, on our identification and regular introduction of new designs that are appealing to our customers, especially children. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, obtain or 13 Table of Contents license popular third-party designs or that our design personnel will be able to timely identify and introduce appealing designs in sufficient volume to support our strategy and operations. We must also anticipate changes in the tastes and preferences of consumers in order to compete for their business successfully. In particular, our ability to anticipate changes in the tastes and preferences of children, which change often and quickly, is crucial to our success, and we could misinterpret or fail to identify trends on a timely basis. Further, product orders must be placed with suppliers before we receive orders from our customers, and the demand for specific products can change between the time the products are ordered by us and the date we receive them. If we underestimate consumer demand, we may disappoint customers and lose potential sales to our competitors. If we overestimate consumer acceptance of our products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or sell our products at discounted prices, which could reduce our sales and gross margins. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands effectively, we may not be able to compete successfully with better-known competitors. Building and maintaining recognition of our brands by families with young children is critical to expanding our customer base and competing successfully against other party goods retailers and mass merchandisers with greater brand recognition. In order to continue building consumer recognition of our brands, we will need to increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand awareness in a manner targeted at families with young children. We cannot be certain that our marketing efforts will attract new customers, enable us to retain existing customers, or encourage repeat purchases. If these efforts are not successful, our sales may not grow to desired levels, or could even decline. If we do not successfully maintain and expand our customer and prospect databases our sales volume could suffer and our marketing costs could increase. We depend on our proprietary customer and prospect databases to facilitate repeat sales and attract new customers. If we fail to keep these databases current, or if the information in these databases is damaged or destroyed, our sales could stagnate or even decline. If we do not expand our databases of customers and prospects, or if we fail to enhance and refine our techniques for segmenting this information to maximize its usefulness, our sales volume could suffer and our marketing costs could increase. In addition, if federal or state governments enact privacy legislation resulting in the increased regulation of mailing lists, we could experience increased costs in complying with new regulations concerning the solicitation of consents or be unable to achieve the desired database and sales volume growth. Our operating results could suffer if we are unable to successfully manage the costs of our catalog operations or if our catalogs fail to produce sales at satisfactory levels. Our catalogs have been an important tool for the acquisition and retention of customers. We believe that the success of our catalogs as a cost-effective marketing tool depends on the following factors:  effective management of costs associated with the production and distribution of our catalogs;  achievement of adequate response rates to our mailings;  displaying a mix of merchandise in our catalogs that is attractive to our customers; and  timely delivery of catalog mailings to our customers. Catalog production and mailings entail substantial paper, printing, postage and labor costs. Increases in the costs of producing and distributing our catalogs, including increases in postage rates, or paper, photography or printing costs, may reduce the margin on sales derived from our catalogs. As we incur nearly all of the costs associated with our catalogs prior to mailing, we are unable to adjust the costs incurred in connection with a particular mailing to reflect the actual performance of the catalog. In addition, response rates to our mailings and, as a result, sales generated by each mailing are affected by factors such as consumer preferences, economic conditions, the timing and mix of our catalog mailings, the timely delivery of these mailings by the postal system, and changes in our merchandise assortment, some of which are outside of our control. A significant increase in the costs 14 Table of Contents associated with producing or distributing our catalogs, or failure of our catalogs to produce sales at satisfactory levels, could have a negative effect on our operating results. Increased product returns, or a failure by us to accurately predict the level of product returns, could harm our business. As part of our customer support commitment, we maintain a product return policy that allows recipients to return most items received from us with which they are dissatisfied. We make allowances for product returns in our financial statements based on historical return rates. We cannot assure you that actual product returns will not significantly exceed our allowances for returns. In addition, because our allowances are based on historical return rates, we cannot assure you that the introduction of new merchandise within existing or new product categories, increased sales over the Internet, changes in the habits of our customers or other factors will not cause actual returns to exceed return allowances, perhaps significantly. Any increase in product returns above our allowances could have a negative impact on our financial results and may, in turn, cause our stock price to decline. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. We operate in several competitive markets including party goods and childrens costumes. Our primary competition comes from traditional retailers that offer a variety of products in the party goods and apparel markets. We believe our primary competition in party goods and costumes is from mass merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart, and party goods superstores such as Party City and Party America. We also compete in these markets with a variety of other companies including: online retailers of party goods; traditional card and gift specialty retailers; supermarkets and drugstores; and catalog retailers of novelty items. Competitors can enter our market with little difficulty and can launch new websites or catalogs at a relatively low cost. Many of these current and potential competitors may have the ability to devote substantially more resources to marketing, customer support, product development and order fulfillment operations than we can. Some of our suppliers also may choose to compete with us directly and may in the future choose not to supply products to us. In addition, larger or more well-financed entities may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors. Some of our competitors may be able to secure products from suppliers on more favorable terms, fulfill orders more efficiently or adopt more aggressive pricing than we can. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer. We depend on search engines to attract customers to our websites, and losing these customers would adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Many consumers access our websites by clicking through search results displayed by Internet search engines. Internet search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic listings and purchased listings. Algorithmic listings cannot be purchased, and instead are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas utilized by the search engine. Purchased listings can be bought by advertisers in order to attract users to their websites. We rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract and direct consumers to our websites. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results. If one or more of the search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings were to modify its algorithms, resulting in fewer consumers clicking through to our websites, we would need to increase our marketing expenditures, which would adversely affect our financial results. In addition, the rates for purchased listings have significantly increased. If one or more of the search engines on which we rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us or if the rates for purchased listings continues to rise, our online marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue could rise, we could lose customers, we could be forced to look for other advertising avenues and traffic to our websites could decrease. Because we do not have long-term contracts for third-party products, we may not have continued access to popular products. Our business depends significantly on the use of third-party products and our future success is contingent upon the continued availability of these products. We do not have long-term arrangements with any vendor or distributor 15 Table of Contents that would guarantee the availability of third-party products and, as a result, we do not have a predictable or guaranteed supply of these products. We cannot assure you we will have access to any third-party products in sufficient quantities. If we are unable to provide our customers with continued access to popular or exclusive third-party products, our sales could decline. If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property, we may have fewer proprietary products and our sales may decline. Many of our proprietary products are based on or incorporate intellectual property and other character or story rights licensed from third parties. These license agreements are limited in scope, typically have a two- or three-year term and lack renewal rights. We may not be able to renew key licenses when they expire or include new products in existing licenses. Moreover, most of these licenses may be terminated immediately if we breach their terms. If we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value, or maintain them at reasonable costs, we will be unable to increase our revenue in the future unless we offset the loss of the products that depend on these licenses with an increase in sales of our independently created proprietary products. Because we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers, we may not have continued access to necessary materials and our sales may suffer. Our financial performance depends on our ability to purchase our products in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We purchase our products from over 250 foreign and domestic manufacturers and distributors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of these suppliers, and therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, access to products or favorable pricing. Any vendor could increase prices or discontinue selling to us at any time. The lack of long-term contracts also exposes us to increased risks associated with changes in local economic conditions, trade issues and foreign currency fluctuations. In our fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, products supplied by our ten largest suppliers represented approximately 35.0% of inventory purchases, with our largest supplier representing 10.6%. If we are unable to maintain these supplier relationships, our ability to offer high-quality, favorably-priced products to our customers may be impaired, and our sales and gross margins could decline. Our reliance on smaller or independent vendors and suppliers and manufacturers located abroad exposes us to various risks including disruption in product supply. Some of our smaller vendors have limited resources, production capacities and operating histories, which means that they may not be able to timely produce sufficient quantities of certain products demanded by our customers. In addition, our relationships with independent foreign suppliers and manufacturers are also subject to a number of risks, including:  work stoppages;  transportation delays and interruptions;  political instability;  foreign currency fluctuations;  changing economic conditions;  an increased likelihood of counterfeit, knock-off or gray market goods;  product liability claims;  expropriation, nationalization, imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers, including quotas and restrictions on the transfer of funds;  environmental regulation; and  other changes in governmental policies. 16 Table of Contents Because of these factors, we may be subject to liability claims or may not be able to acquire desired products in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us. Any inability to acquire suitable products, the loss of one or more key vendors, or the settlement or outcome of a product liability suit could have a negative effect on our sales and operating results. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of lesser quality or more expensive than those we currently purchase. We cannot be certain that such factors will not prevent us from procuring manufactured products in a cost-effective or timely manner. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell causes harm or damages to any of our customers or other individuals, we could be vulnerable to product liability claims. Although we maintain insurance against product liability claims, our coverage may be inadequate to cover any liabilities we may incur. We also work with experts to test some of our products for safety compliance, but our tests may not identify all potential product defects before products are sold. Even if we successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims, we could be required to remove products from inventory, and we could suffer adverse publicity about the safety and fitness of our products, any of which could harm our business. Failure of third parties to deliver our products efficiently and in a timely manner could cause us to lose customers. We rely upon other parties for product shipments to and from our Greensboro, North Carolina fulfillment and distribution center. It is possible that events beyond our control, such as strikes, trucking shortages, the imposition of tariffs, rail disruption, or other disruption, could affect the ability of these parties to deliver inventory items to our facilities or merchandise to our customers. The failure of these parties to deliver goods to or from our facilities could result in delays in fulfillment of customer orders. Because our customer orders are often time-sensitive, delays by our third-party shipment providers could hurt our reputation and our ability to obtain repeat orders. Fluctuations in commodity prices may increase our operating costs and make our expenses difficult to predict. We are vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of paper stock. Paper goods comprise a significant portion of our total inventory. In addition, a portion of our marketing expenditures are related to our direct marketing efforts which include our paper catalogs. If the price of paper increases significantly, we may be unable to pass the additional costs on to our customers, which could hurt our profitability. In addition, fluctuations in commodity prices could make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our expenses. We will consider acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, and failure to adequately evaluate or integrate any acquisitions could harm our business. We have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. In April 1997 we acquired the assets of Great Days Publishing, Inc., a product line that offers a variety of personalized date history scrolls that chronicle noteworthy events. This product line is marketed under our Birthday Express brand. In April 2001, we acquired the assets of Storybook Inc. In June of 2006, we announced the wind-down of the Storybook brand. We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire other products and businesses that could enhance or complement our current products and services or expand the breadth of our product categories or customer base. Potential and completed acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:  problems assimilating the purchased products or business operations;  problems maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;  diversion of managements attention from our existing brands;  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; 17 Table of Contents  risks associated with entering product categories in which we have no or limited prior experience; and  potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations. For example, in the acquisition of Storybook Heirlooms, integration expenses were higher than forecasted and we were unable to achieve acceptable revenue levels for the brand. If we fail to properly evaluate and execute future acquisitions, our management team may be distracted from our day-to-day operations, our business may be disrupted, and our operating results may suffer. The favorable impact of the income tax benefit in 2004 affects the comparability of our results, and utilization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. In our fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, based on the information existing at that time including consideration of our forecasted book and tax income, we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by $9.0 million and recognized a corresponding tax benefit in our fiscal 2004 results of operations. This tax benefit causes our financial results for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2004 to appear significantly more favorable than they would in the absence of the tax benefit. The favorable impact of the $9.0 million tax benefit may distort the trends in our operating results and will impact the comparability of our results of operations with other periods. The tax benefit may also make our financial results appear more favorable than those of companies with similar results of operations that have not reduced a valuation allowance on their net deferred tax assets in the comparable period. In addition, should our operating results fall below expectations, we may need to evaluate the need to re-establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. If the valuation allowance were to be re-established it would negatively affect the financial results in the period in which it was re-established. Additionally, future changes in ownership of our common stock may restrict the ability to realize the benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards. Our business involves the extensive use of intellectual property, and related claims against us could be costly or force us to abandon popular products. Third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our business or the products we make or use infringe upon their rights. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert claims of infringement against us, or whether any past or future assertions or prosecutions of infringement will harm our business. If we are forced to defend against any such claims, whether they are with or without merit and even if they are determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation, diversion of the attention of our technical and management personnel and product shipment delays. As a result of any infringement dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may be on unfavorable terms. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, and we are unable to develop non-infringing products or license the infringed or similar product on a timely basis or at all, we will need to drop the infringed product from our offerings and our sales could suffer. If the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights is inadequate, our brands and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers. The steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate. We regard our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. Birthday Express and BirthdayExpress.com are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office, and we have filed federal trademark applications for Costume Express and Celebrate Express. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain registration for our filed trademarks or for trademarks we submit applications for in the future. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we will sell our products and services. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights and our brands and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers. 18 Table of Contents If we cannot maintain and protect our existing domain names or acquire suitable new domain names as needed, we may not be able to successfully build our brands. We may be unable to acquire or maintain Internet domain names relating to our brands in the United States and other countries in which we may conduct business. As a result, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names relating to our brands. Such use could damage our brands and reputation and divert customers away from our websites. We currently hold various relevant domain names, including www.BirthdayExpress.com, www.Storybook.com, www.CelebrateExpress.com, and www.CostumeExpress.com. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally is regulated by governmental agencies. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names, any of which may affect our ability to maintain the domain names we need for our business. If we cannot prevent others from using similar domain names we may be unable to successfully build our brands. Capacity constraints, systems failures or security breaches could prevent access to our websites, which could lower our sales and harm our reputation. Our service goals of performance, reliability and availability require that we have adequate capacity in our computer systems to cope with the volume of customers on our websites. As our operations grow in size and scope, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer customers enhanced services, capacity, features and functionality. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance of a corresponding increase in sales. If we cannot expand our systems in a timely manner to cope with increased customer usage, we could experience disruptions in service, slower response times, lower customer satisfaction and delays in the introduction of new products and services. Any of these problems could impair our reputation, damage our brands and cause our sales to decline. Our ability to provide high-quality service depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. Our website has experienced system interruptions from time to time and could experience periodic system interruptions in the future. Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, design defects, vandalism, denial-of-service attacks and similar events. We do not have a formal disaster recovery plan or alternate providers of web hosting services, and outages at our data centers could mean the temporary loss of the use of our websites. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for the associated losses. Any system failure or security breach that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our customer support center or websites could impair our reputation, damage our brands and cause a decrease in sales. If we are unable to provide satisfactory telephone-based customer support, we could lose customers. Our ability to provide satisfactory levels of customer support also depends, to a large degree, on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our customer support center. Any material disruption or slowdown in our telephone order processing systems resulting from capacity constraints, labor disputes, telephone or Internet failures, power or service outages, natural disasters or other events could make it difficult or impossible to provide adequate telephone-based customer support. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain an adequate number of competent customer support representatives, which is essential in creating a favorable customer experience. If we are unable to continually provide adequate staffing for our customer support operations, our reputation could be seriously harmed. In addition, we cannot assure you that call volumes will not exceed our present system capacities. If this occurs, we could experience delays in accepting orders, responding to customer inquiries and addressing customer concerns. Also, we may be required to expand our customer support center in the near future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find additional suitable facilities on acceptable terms or at all, which could seriously hinder our ability to provide satisfactory levels of customer support. Because our success depends in large part on keeping our customers satisfied, any failure to provide satisfactory levels of customer support would likely impair our reputation and we could lose customers. 19 Table of Contents Temporary or permanent disruption at our fulfillment facility could prevent timely shipment of customer orders and hurt our sales. We assemble, package, and ship our orders, and process all product returns, at our Greensboro, North Carolina fulfillment and distribution facility. In the future, we may be unable to fulfill our customers orders at this facility in a timely manner, or at all, due to a number of factors, including:  a failure to maintain or renew our existing lease agreement;  a power, telecommunications or other systems failure;  an employee strike or other labor stoppage;  terrorist attacks, acts of war or break-ins;  a disruption in the transportation infrastructure including air traffic and roads; or  fire, flood, hurricane or other disaster. In the event that we are temporarily unable to timely fulfill our customers orders through our Greensboro facility, we will either upgrade the shipping or attempt to re-ship the orders from another source. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill all orders or that we will be able to deliver the affected orders in a timely manner. This could result in increased fulfillment costs or a decrease in sales, as well as the potential loss of repeat orders from affected customers. In addition, if operations at our Greensboro facility become permanently disrupted due to any of the above or other factors, we may not be able to secure a replacement fulfillment and distribution facility on terms acceptable to us or at all. We do not currently maintain back-up power systems at our Greensboro facility, nor do we have a formal disaster recovery plan and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that occur in the event operations at our fulfillment and distribution center are interrupted. We may incur significant costs or experience product availability delays in complying with regulations applicable to the sale of our manufactured products. We use a variety of water-based inks, paper and coatings in the manufacture of our paper party products. We are required to maintain our manufacturing operations in compliance with United States federal, state and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to rules and regulations associated with consumer protection and safety, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to our business could significantly increase our costs of goods sold and we may not be able to pass these increases on to our customers. If we fail to comply with current laws and regulations applicable to our business, or to pass annual inspections of our facilities by regulatory bodies, we could be subject to fines and penalties or even interruptions of our operations. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to the risk of private lawsuits and damages. If use of the Internet, particularly with respect to online commerce, does not continue to increase as rapidly as we anticipate, our sales may not grow to desired levels. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, our online sales represented approximately 69% of our total sales. Our future sales and profits are substantially dependent upon the continued use of the Internet as an effective medium of business and communication by our customers. Internet use may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use the Internet and other online services as a medium for commerce. Highly-publicized failures of some online retailers in meeting consumer demands could result in consumer reluctance to adopt the Internet as a means for commerce, and thereby damage our reputation and brands and reduce our revenues and results of operations. In addition, the Internet may not be accepted as a viable long-term commercial marketplace for a number of reasons, including:  actual or perceived lack of security of information or privacy protection; 20 Table of Contents  possible disruptions, computer viruses or other damage to the Internet servers or to users computers; and  excessive governmental regulation. If the Internet fails to continue growing as a commercial marketplace, our sales may not increase as much as desired by our shareholders, or at all. Risks related to the Internet, including security and reliability issues, are largely outside our control and may hurt our reputation or sales. Our online business is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside our control. In addition to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to Internet usage, we are vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet. These risks include changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime or slowdowns and other technical failures or human errors, changes in applicable federal and state regulation, security breaches, and consumer privacy concerns. Our failure to respond successfully to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales through our online business, as well as damage our reputation and increase our selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, our success will depend, in large part, upon third parties maintaining the Internet infrastructure to provide a reliable network backbone with the speed, data capacity, security and hardware necessary for reliable Internet access and services. Our business, which relies on graphically-rich websites that require the transmission of substantial data, is also significantly dependent upon the availability and adoption of broadband Internet access and other high-speed Internet connectivity technologies. Any significant reliability, data capacity or connectivity problems experienced by the Internet or its users could harm our sales and profitability. Government regulation of database use in direct marketing and Internet and online commerce is evolving. Unfavorable changes in these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws that specifically govern database use in direct marketing and Internet and online commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws may impede the growth of database direct marketing, Internet or other online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, restrictions on imports and exports, customs, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, email restrictions, the provision of online payment services, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to database direct marketing, the Internet and online commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may slow the growth of database direct marketing, online commerce and, in turn, our business. Our failure to protect confidential information of our customers and our network against security breaches could damage our reputation and brands and subject us to legal liability. A significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Currently, a majority of our sales are billed to our customers credit card accounts directly. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect customer transaction data. Any compromise of our security could damage our reputation and brands and expose us to a risk of lost sales, or litigation and possible legal liability. In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Our failure to address risks associated with credit card fraud could damage our reputation and brands. Under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholders signature. We do not currently carry insurance against this risk. To date, we have experienced 21 Table of Contents minimal losses from credit card fraud, but we face the risk of significant losses from this type of fraud as our net sales increase. Such losses could impair our results of operations. In addition, any failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could damage our reputation and brands, and reduce our sales. Our sales may decrease if we are required to collect taxes on purchases. We do not collect or have imposed upon us sales, use or other taxes related to the products we sell, except for certain corporate-level taxes and sales taxes with respect to purchases by customers located in the states of North Carolina and Washington. However, one or more states may seek to impose sales, use or other tax collection obligations on us in the future. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should be collecting sales, use or other taxes on the sale of our products could result in substantial tax liabilities and penalties in connection with past sales. In addition, if we are required to collect these taxes we will lose one of our current cost advantages, which may decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and substantially harm our sales. We have based our policies for sales tax collection on our interpretation of certain decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court that restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made through catalogs or over the Internet. However, implementation of the restrictions imposed by these Supreme Court decisions is subject to interpretation by state and local taxing authorities. While we believe that these Supreme Court decisions currently restrict state and local taxing authorities outside the states of North Carolina and Washington from requiring us to collect sales and use taxes from purchasers located within their jurisdictions, taxing authorities outside of North Carolina and Washington could disagree with our interpretation of these decisions. Moreover, a number of states, as well as the U.S. Congress, have been considering various initiatives that could limit or supersede the Supreme Courts position regarding sales and use taxes on Internet sales. If any state or local taxing jurisdiction were to disagree with our interpretation of the Supreme Courts current position regarding state and local taxation of Internet sales, or if any of these initiatives were to address the Supreme Courts constitutional concerns and result in a reversal of its current position, we could be required to collect sales and use taxes from purchasers located in states other than North Carolina and Washington. The imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon Internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us and could decrease our future sales. Failure to rapidly respond to technological change could result in our services or systems becoming obsolete. As the Internet and online commerce industries evolve, we may be required to license emerging technologies useful to our business, enhance our existing services, develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. We may not be able to successfully implement these new services and technologies or adapt our websites, telephone and transaction-processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards. Some of our computer systems use antiquated software that is no longer supported by the vendor. If we were to encounter problems with these systems it could be costly and time consuming to correct, and may disrupt operations. If we fail to respond to these issues in a timely manner, we may lose existing customers and be unable to attract sufficient numbers of new customers. Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or if the market perceives that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock may decline. Our former chief executive officer and president has in the past established, and he and other officers or directors may in the future establish, programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 for the purpose of effecting sales of common stock. We have also registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee benefits plans. As a result, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws. The holders of a significant portion of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the resale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other shareholders. These registration rights of our shareholders could impair our ability to raise capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock. 22 Table of Contents We will need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements. As a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other requirements will increase our costs and require additional management time and resources. We may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy new reporting requirements. Compliance with Section 404 may first apply to our fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. If our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be ineffective, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal controls over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our stock price.
