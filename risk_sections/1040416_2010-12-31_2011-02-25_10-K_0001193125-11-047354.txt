Item 1A. Risk Factors. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a substantial risk of loss. You should carefully read this entire report and should give particular attention to the following risk factors. You should recognize that other significant risks may arise in the future, which we cannot foresee at this time. Also, the risks that we now foresee might affect us to a greater or different degree than expected. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements in this report. These factors include, without limitation, the risk factors listed below and other factors presented throughout this report and any other reports filed by us with the SEC. Risks Related to Product Commercialization Failure to adequately market and commercialize AzaSite will negatively impact our revenues. The commercial success of AzaSite will depend on a number of factors, including:  Acceptance by patients and physicians;  Effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;  Ability to differentiate AzaSite relative to our competitors products;  Ability to further develop clinical information to support AzaSite;  Market satisfaction with existing alternative therapies;  Perceived efficacy relative to other available therapies;  Disease prevalence;  Cost of treatment;  Pricing and availability of alternative products, including generic or over-the-counter products;  Marketing and sales activities of competitors;  Shifts in the medical community to new treatment paradigms or standards of care;  Relative convenience and ease of administration;  Adequate production and supply of commercial product and samples; and  Our ability to enter into managed care and governmental agreements on favorable terms. We are responsible for all aspects of the commercialization of this product, including the determination of formularies upon which AzaSite is listed, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales. The determination of formularies upon which AzaSite is listed, the discounts and pricing under such formularies, as well as the amount of time it takes for us to obtain favorable formulary status under various plans, will impact our commercialization efforts. Additionally, inclusion on certain formularies requires significant price concessions through rebate programs that impact the level of revenue that we receive. The need to give price concessions can be particularly acute where competing products are listed on the same formulary, such as the area of bacterial conjunctivitis. If AzaSite is not successfully commercialized, our revenues will be limited. Under our agreement with InSite Vision, we are obligated to make pre-determined minimum annual royalty payments to InSite Vision. To the extent annual royalty payments actually paid to InSite Vision on our sales of AzaSite are less than the minimum annual royalty amounts established under our agreement with InSite Vision, we are obligated to pay the difference. In the event we are required to make annual minimum royalty payments, 19 Table of Contents our profits with respect to AzaSite, if any, will be decreased or any losses with respect to the product will be increased. Such circumstances may result in us ceasing our commercialization of AzaSite and terminating our agreement with InSite Vision. Based on actual net sales from AzaSite during the fourth quarter of 2010 and our expectation of net sales from AzaSite in 2011, we anticipate incurring a shortfall of the minimum royalty due to InSite Vision at the end of September 30, 2011. Under our agreement with the manufacturer of AzaSite, we are required to purchase a minimum number of units of AzaSite annually, regardless of our ability to sell AzaSite. If we are unable to sell the quantities of AzaSite that we are required to purchase, our inventory of the product will increase and the shelf life of the inventory will be adversely impacted. In such circumstances, we may be required to make price concessions to sell short-dated product or write-off and dispose of expired product, which may have an adverse affect on our AzaSite profitability. If Restasis is not successfully commercialized by Allergan, our revenues will be negatively impacted. Allergan is responsible for commercializing Restasis. Accordingly, our revenues on the net sales of Restasis are dependent on the actions and success of Allergan, over whom we have no control. The manufacture and sale of Restasis is protected in the United States by a formulation patent that expires in May 2014. While a formulation patent may afford certain limited protection, a competitor may attempt to gain FDA approval for a cyclosporine product using a different formulation. Furthermore, following the expiration of the formulation patent in 2014, a generic form of Restasis could be introduced into the market. If and when Restasis experiences competition from a cyclosporine product, including generics, our revenues attributable to Restasis may be significantly impacted. Other factors that could affect the commercialization of Restasis include:  Extent and effectiveness of Allergans sales and marketing efforts;  Satisfaction with existing alternative therapies, including generic or over-the-counter products;  Perceived efficacy relative to other available therapies;  Changes in, or the levels of, third-party reimbursement of product costs;  Coverage and reimbursement under Medicare Part D, state government sponsored plans and commercial plans;  Cost of treatment;  Development and FDA approval of competing dry eye products; and  Shifts in the medical community to new treatment paradigms or standards of care. When a generic form of Elestat or an over-the-counter form of epinastine ophthalmic solution is introduced into the market, which we expect may occur at any time, our agreement with Allergan to co-promote Elestat will no longer be in effect, and our revenues from sales of Elestat will be nominal. Our Elestat co-promotion agreement with Allergan provides that unless earlier terminated, the term of such agreement will be in effect until the earlier of (i) the approval and launch of the first generic epinastine product after expiration of the FDA exclusivity period covering Elestat in the United States, or (ii) the approval and launch of the first over-the-counter epinastine product after expiration of the listing of Elestat in the FDA publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence (commonly called the Orange Book). Following the termination of the co-promotion agreement, we will no longer have the right to co-promote Elestat. We will be entitled to receive post-termination payments from Allergan, based on any remaining net sales of Elestat for a period of 36 months. During the three successive 12-month periods immediately following the termination of the agreement, Allergan will be obligated to pay to us 20%, 15% and 10%, respectively, on any net sales of Elestat in the United States. 20 Table of Contents Subject to applicable law, competitors are permitted to submit to the FDA an ANDA for a generic version of Elestat, due to the expiration of the marketing exclusivity period for Elestat provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act on October 15, 2008. We are aware that the following companies have filed an ANDA for a generic version of Elestat: Apotex, Inc., Cypress Pharmaceutical, Inc., Paddock Laboratories, Inc., PharmaForce, Inc. and Sandoz, Inc. The date of submission of the first ANDA filing to the FDA Office of Generic Drugs was October 14, 2008, according to the FDAs website (www.fda.gov). Also, according to the FDAs website, Apotex, Inc., PharmaForce, Inc. and Sandoz, Inc. have each received tentative approval for their respective epinastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution. The FDAs review of an ANDA is a confidential process between the FDA and the applicable ANDA filer. We do not expect to be informed by the FDA, any ANDA filer or any other party regarding the status or timing of the review relating to any of the ANDA filings pertaining to a generic form of Elestat. The FDA may complete its review of the filed ANDAs at any time. As a result, we expect to be required to stop the co-promotion of Elestat with little, if any, advance notice. We expect that a generic form of epinastine may be launched at any time. The loss of co-promotion revenue from Elestat will significantly impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we do not successfully market and promote Elestat, our revenues will be negatively impacted. Notwithstanding the expected termination of the Elestat agreement upon the launch of a generic form of Elestat, our present revenues depend, in part, upon the continued acceptance of Elestat by eye care professionals, allergists and patients. Other factors that could affect the commercialization of Elestat include:  Satisfaction with existing alternative therapies, including therapies requiring only one dose per day;  Decreases in the size of the market for topical allergic conjunctivitis products;  Extent and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;  Changes in, or the levels of, third-party reimbursement of product costs;  Coverage and reimbursement under Medicare Part D, state government sponsored plans and commercial plans;  Pricing and availability of alternative products, including generic or over-the-counter products; and  Marketing and sales activities of competitors. We rely on third parties to distribute and sell our products and those third parties may not perform. We are dependent on third parties to perform or assist us in the distribution or sale of AzaSite, and are dependent on third parties, primarily Allergan, for the distribution and sale of Elestat. We rely on the services of a single source, third-party distributor to deliver AzaSite to our customers. In addition to the physical storage and distribution of AzaSite, this third-party distributor maintains and provides us with information and data with regard to our AzaSite inventory, orders, billings and receivables, chargebacks and returns, among others, on which our accounting estimates are based. If third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties in maximizing the commercial potential of our products, we may be required to hire or expand our own staff and sales force to compete successfully, which may not be possible. If third parties or Allergan do not perform, or assist us in performing these functions, or if there is a delay or interruption in the distribution of our products, it could have an adverse effect on product revenue, accounting estimates and our overall operations. We depend on three pharmaceutical wholesalers for the vast majority of our AzaSite sales in the United States, and the loss of any of these wholesalers could negatively impact our revenues. The prescription drug wholesaling industry in the United States is highly concentrated, with a vast majority of all sales made by three major full-line companies: Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen. Greater than 85% of our AzaSite revenues come from sales to these three companies. The loss of any of these wholesalers could have a negative impact on our commercialization of AzaSite. 21 Table of Contents It is also possible that these wholesalers, or others, could decide to change their policies and fees in the future. This could result in or cause us to incur higher product distribution costs, lower margins or the need to find alternative methods of distributing our products. Such alternative methods may not be economically or administratively feasible. If Diquas is not successfully commercialized by Santen in Japan, we may not receive any royalty revenues with respect to the sales of such product. In December 2010, Santen launched Diquas in Japan. Santen is solely responsible for commercializing Diquas. Accordingly, royalty revenues on the net sales of Diquas are dependent on the successful commercialization efforts of Santen, over whom we have no control. Factors that could affect the commercialization of Diquas in Japan include:  The production of sufficient quantities of the product in order to facilitate the launch of the product and adequately supply the market;  Perceived efficacy relative to other available therapies;  Development and regulatory approval of competing dry eye products;  The extent and effectiveness of Santens sales and marketing efforts; and  Satisfaction with existing alternative therapies, including generic or over-the-counter products. Risks Related to Manufacture and Supply If we are unable to contract with third parties for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients required for preclinical testing, for the manufacture of drug products for clinical trials or for the large-scale manufacture of any approved products, we may be unable to develop or commercialize our drug products. The manufacturing of sufficient quantities of new products or product candidates is a time-consuming and complex process. We have no experience or capabilities to conduct the manufacture of any of our products or product candidates. In order to successfully commercialize AzaSite and continue to develop our product candidates, we need to contract or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing services. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDAs cGMP regulations capable of manufacturing for us or our collaborators. We depend upon third parties for the manufacture of API, finished drug products for clinical trials, and for the manufacture of AzaSite. We expect to depend upon third parties for the large-scale manufacture of commercial quantities of any other approved product. This dependence may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely and competitive basis. Similarly, our dependence on our partners to arrange for their own supplies of finished drug products may adversely affect our operations and revenues. If we, or our partners, are unable to engage or retain third-party manufacturers on a long-term basis or on commercially acceptable terms, our products may not be commercialized as planned, and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. Reliance on a single party to manufacture and supply either finished product or the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients for a product or product candidates could adversely affect us. Under our agreements with Allergan, Allergan is responsible for the manufacture and supply of Restasis and Elestat. Allergan relies upon an arrangement with a single third party for the manufacture and supply of APIs for each of Restasis and Elestat. Allergan then completes the manufacturing process to yield finished product. Under our supply agreement with InSite Vision, InSite Vision is responsible for supplying us with azithromycin, the API used in AzaSite. InSite Vision, in turn, relies upon an arrangement with a single third party for the manufacture and supply of such API. We are responsible for producing the finished product form of 22 Table of Contents AzaSite, which is currently manufactured by a single party. There can be no assurance that such manufacturer will be able to continue to produce sufficient quantities of finished product in a timely manner to support the commercialization of AzaSite. In the event a third-party manufacturer is unable to supply Allergan or InSite Vision (as the case may be), if such supply is unreasonably delayed, or if Allergan or our finished product contract supplier are unable to complete the manufacturing cycle, sales of the applicable product could be adversely impacted, which would result in a reduction in any applicable product revenue. In addition, if Allergan or the third-party manufacturers do not maintain cGMP compliance, the FDA could require corrective actions or take enforcement actions that could affect production and availability of the applicable product, thus adversely affecting sales. It would be time consuming and costly to identify and qualify new sources for manufacture of APIs or finished products. If our vendors were to terminate our arrangement or fail to meet our supply needs we might be forced to delay our development programs and/or be unable to supply products to the market, which could delay or reduce revenues and result in loss of market share. Risks Related to Product Development If the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates meet statutory requirements for safety and efficacy, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for marketing in the United States. We have to conduct significant development activities, non-clinical and clinical tests and obtain regulatory approval before our product candidates can be commercialized. Product candidates that may appear to be promising at early stages of development may not successfully reach the market for a number of reasons. The results of preclinical and clinical testing of our product candidates under development may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. Additionally, companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials. Our ongoing clinical trials might be delayed or halted for various reasons, including:  The measure of efficacy of the drug is not statistically significant compared to placebo;  Patients experience severe side effects or serious adverse events during treatment;  Patients die during the clinical trial because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that may or may not relate to the drug being studied;  Patients do not enroll in the clinical trials at the rate we expect;  We decide to modify the drug or the clinical trial protocol during testing;  Our commercial partners, or future commercial partners, delay, amend or change our development plan or strategy; and  We allocate our limited financial and other resources to other clinical and preclinical programs. Changes in regulatory policy or new regulations as well as clinical investigator misconduct could also result in delays or rejection of our applications for approval of our product candidates. Clinical investigator misconduct that raises questions about the integrity of data in one or more applications (e.g., fraud, bribery, omission of a material fact, gross negligence) could be used by the FDA as grounds to suspend substantive scientific review of any or all pending marketing applications until the data in question have successfully undergone a validity assessment. Product candidates that fail validity assessments must be withdrawn from FDA review or, if the drug is an approved, marketed product, such product must be removed from the market. Additionally, the introduction of our products in foreign markets will subject us to foreign regulatory clearances, the receipt of which may be unpredictable, uncertain and may impose substantial additional costs and 23 Table of Contents burdens which we or our partners in such foreign markets may be unwilling or unable to fund. As with the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities must be satisfied that adequate evidence of safety and efficacy of the product has been presented before marketing authorization is granted. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA marketing approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by other regulatory authorities, nor does approval by any foreign regulatory authority ensure approval by the FDA. Since there may be no regulatory precedents for our clinical candidates, conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval may be difficult, expensive and prolonged, which would delay any commercialization of our products. To complete successful clinical trials, our product candidates must demonstrate safety and provide substantial evidence of efficacy. The FDA generally evaluates efficacy based on the statistical significance of a product candidate meeting predetermined clinical endpoints. The design of clinical trials to establish meaningful endpoints is done in collaboration with the FDA prior to the commencement of clinical trials. We establish these endpoints based on guidance from the FDA, including FDA guidance documents applicable to establishing the efficacy, safety and tolerability measures required for approval of products. Depending upon the disease our product candidate is designed to treat, the FDA may not have established guidelines for the design of our clinical trials and may take longer than average to consider our product candidates for approval. The FDA could change its view on clinical trial design and establishment of appropriate standards for efficacy, safety and tolerability and require a change in clinical trial design, additional data or even further clinical trials before granting approval of our product candidates. We could encounter delays and increased expenses in our clinical trials if the FDA concludes that the endpoints established for a clinical trial do not adequately predict a clinical benefit. We have initiated a Phase 2 development program to evaluate the use of AzaSite for the treatment of blepharitis. The FDA has not published guidelines on the approval of a product for the treatment of blepharitis. Furthermore, to date, no prescription product has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of blepharitis. The FDA may require that we evaluate the product in relation to different primary and/or secondary clinical endpoints than those being used presently. This may require us to undertake additional Phase 2 clinical trials, which could lead to increased costs and program delays. We may need to develop alternate dosing regimens for our product candidates. In order to achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates, we may need to develop, alone or with others, alternate dosing regimens and methods for administering our products. If the number of doses, or the method of dosing, is not convenient, patients may not use our product. Furthermore, if patients use our products at a dosing level that is less than the dosing level tested in our clinical trials, the drug may not be efficacious or may be less efficacious. In such cases, the patient may look for alternative therapies. Clinical trials may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect, which would adversely affect our ability to commercialize product candidates and achieve profitability. The number and type of studies that may be required by the FDA, or other regulatory authorities, for a particular compound are based on the compounds clinical profile compared to existing therapies for the targeted patient population. While all new compounds require standard regulated phases of testing, the actual type and scope of testing can vary significantly among different product candidates and as a result, creates additional complexity when estimating program costs. Factors that affect the costs of a clinical trial include:  The number of patients required to participate in clinical trials to demonstrate statistical significance for a drugs safety and efficacy and the number and geographical location of clinical trial sites necessary to enroll such patients; 24 Table of Contents  The time required to enroll the targeted number of patients in clinical trials, which may vary depending on the size and availability of the relevant patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the perceived benefit to the clinical trial participants and approval of the Institutional Review Board;  Appropriate identification of optimal treatment regimens;  Adequate supplies of drug product;  Monitoring and auditing; and  The number and type of required laboratory tests supporting clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times. Even if we successfully complete clinical trials, we may not receive regulatory approval for the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities require additional clinical trials, we could face increased costs and significant development delays. Additionally, ongoing development programs and associated costs are subject to frequent, significant and unpredictable changes due to a number of factors, including:  Data collected in preclinical or clinical trials may prompt significant changes, delays or enhancements to an ongoing development program;  Commercial partners and the underlying contractual agreements may require additional or more involved clinical or preclinical activities;  The FDA or other regulatory authorities may direct the sponsor to change or enhance its ongoing development program based on developments in the testing of similar compounds or related compounds;  Unexpected regulatory requirements, changes in regulatory policy or review standards, or interim reviews by regulatory agencies may cause delays or changes to development programs;  Unexpected and serious events, reactions, or experiences of clinical trial participants may cause delays or changes to the development programs and could result in a clinical hold, which would stop the clinical trial until the FDA determined that the trial or development program could be resumed; and  Anticipated manufacturing costs may change significantly due to necessary changes in manufacturing processes, variances from anticipated manufacturing process yields or changes in the cost and/or availability of starting materials, and other costs to ensure the manufacturing facility is in compliance with cGMP requirements and is capable of consistently producing the product candidate in accordance with established specifications submitted to the FDA. The occurrence of any of these factors may result in significant disparities in total costs required to complete the respective development programs. If we fail to reach milestones or to make annual minimum payments or otherwise breach our obligations under our license agreements, our licensors may terminate our agreements with them and seek additional remedies. If we fail to meet payment obligations, performance milestones relating to the timing of regulatory filings, development and commercial diligence obligations, fail to make milestone payments in accordance with applicable provisions, or fail to pay the minimum annual payments under our respective licenses, our licensors may terminate the applicable license. As a result, our development of the respective product candidate or commercialization of the product would cease. 25 Table of Contents Risks Related to Governmental Regulation Failure to comply with all applicable regulations, including those that require us to obtain and maintain governmental approvals for our product candidates, may result in fines, corrective actions, administrative sanctions and restrictions, including the withdrawal of a product from the market. Pharmaceutical companies are subject to significant regulation by a number of local, state, and federal governmental agencies, including the FDA. Such regulations and their authorizing statutes are amended from time to time. There are laws and regulations that govern areas including financial controls, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, packaging, shipping, distribution, post-approval safety surveillance, marketing, and promotion of pharmaceuticals, including those governing interactions with prescribers and health care professionals in a position to prescribe, recommend, or arrange for the provision of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could, among other things, result in warning letters, fines, corrective actions, administrative sanctions, suspensions or delays of product manufacture or distribution or both, product recalls, delays in marketing activities and sales, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and civil or criminal sanctions including seizure of product, court-ordered injunctions, and possible exclusion from eligibility for federal government contracts and reimbursement of our products by Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors. Senior management and the executives of an FDA-regulated company, such as ours, can be individually criminally prosecuted for violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and, unlike typical criminal actions, the government is not required to show an intent to violate the law. Successful criminal prosecutions can lead to debarment from providing any services to a drug company in any capacity. If this occurred, the reputation of the company could suffer, sales could decrease, formularies could refuse to include our drug products, and/or our revenues could be reduced and result in loss of market share. After initial regulatory approval, the manufacturing and marketing of drugs, including our products, are subject to continuing FDA and foreign regulatory requirements and oversight. The FDA requires drug manufacturers and distributors to monitor the safety of a drug after it is approved and marketed. We are required to document and investigate reports of adverse events and report serious adverse events to the FDA. Additionally, the FDA encourages health professionals to report significant adverse events associated with products. The FDA may require additional clinical studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to evaluate product safety effects. In addition to studies required by the FDA after approval, we may conduct our own Phase 4 studies to explore the use of the approved drug product for treatment of new indications or to broaden our knowledge of the product. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a products safety or efficacy as a result of these studies or as reported in their prescribed use may result in the implementation of an FDA-required risk evaluation and mitigation strategy known as REMS, restrictions through labeling changes, or withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA periodically inspects drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cGMP regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or court-ordered injunction, which could include mandatory recall of a product, and consent decrees that could be in place for up to five years or more until the government is satisfied with the companys corrective and preventive actions to ensure compliance. Under a consent decree, a company is typically required to submit to third-party inspections, additional FDA reporting requirements, additional corrective actions, limitations on doing business in certain states, and disgorgement of any profits as a result of the wrongful conduct alleged by the government, all of which could significantly affect the cost of doing business and the companys reputation, reduce revenues, and result in a loss of market share. Before taking such actions, the FDA may first issue one or more notices of compliance deficiencies. Such notices include inspectional observations on Form FDA-483, warning letters, and other untitled written correspondence; however, the FDA may also take action without such notice in situations of egregious noncompliance or where public safety is at risk. The FDA may also request us to take actions voluntarily or we may initiate actions ourselves such as recalls or suspension of manufacturing to ensure compliance with cGMP regulations. 26 Table of Contents Additional authority to take post-approval actions was given to the FDA under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. The FDA is authorized to revisit and change its prior determinations if new information raises questions about our products safety profile. The FDA is authorized to impose additional post-marketing requirements, such as development of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy which could include additional monitoring of post-approval adverse events, providing additional patient safety information, and adding warnings, precautions, and other safety information to the labeling. Failure to implement such requirements could result in corrective actions, fines, withdrawal of marketing approval, or any combination of such actions. In its regulation of drug product advertising and promotional activities, the FDA may issue correspondence to pharmaceutical companies alleging that their advertising, promotional materials or activities are false or misleading and requesting corrective actions to remove and mitigate claims made in such materials. Pharmaceutical advertising and promotional activity must be true, fairly balanced between benefits and risks, provide adequate risk information, and be within the labeled indications. Drug manufacturers are prohibited from promoting unapproved, investigational drug products, and any approved and marketed drug product for a use that is not on the approved labeling; however, healthcare professionals are free to use the product for any use that, in the judgment of the healthcare professional, may be appropriate for any individual patient. The FDA and the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) have the power to impose a wide array of sanctions on companies for advertising practices that are found to be false or misleading, do not include adequate risk information, or promote an unapproved or off-label use and, if we were to receive correspondence from the FDA or the OIG alleging such practices, it may be necessary for us to:  Incur substantial expenses, including fines, penalties, legal fees and costs to conform to the FDAs limits on such promotion;  Change our methods of marketing, promoting and selling products;  Take corrective action, which could include placing advertisements or sending letters to physicians correcting statements made in previous advertisements or promotions; or  Disrupt the distribution of products and halt or suspend sales until we are in compliance with the FDAs interpretation of applicable laws and regulations. Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation and legislative or regulatory reform of the health care system may affect our or our partners ability to sell products profitably. In both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 established a voluntary Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit under Part D of the Social Security Act. The program, which went into effect January 1, 2006, is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the HHS and is implemented and operated by private sector Part D plan sponsors. Each participating drug plan is permitted by regulation to develop and establish its own unique drug formulary that may exclude certain drugs from coverage and impose prior authorization and other coverage restrictions, and negotiate payment levels with drug manufacturers that may be lower than reimbursement levels available through private health plans or other payers. Moreover, beneficiary co-insurance requirements can vary, which could influence which products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. The federal government continues to issue guidance and regulations regarding the obligations of Part D sponsors under the program, and a number of changes to the Part D program were included in recently-enacted health reform legislation, as discussed below. Allergan is responsible for Medicare Part D program activities relating to Restasis and Elestat and has contracted with Part D plan sponsors to cover such drugs under the Part D benefit. We are responsible for contracting with Part D plan sponsors with respect to AzaSite. There is no assurance that any drug that we co-promote or sell will be covered by drug plans participating under the Medicare Part D program or, if covered, what the terms of any such coverage will be, or that the drugs will be reimbursed at amounts that reflect current or historical payment levels. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the 27 Table of Contents reimbursement changes associated with the Medicare prescription drug program or by changes in the formularies or price negotiations with Part D drug plans. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicare coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects of lower Medicare payment may be magnified by private insurers adopting similar lower payment. Our products also can be impacted by state and federal legislative and regulatory changes in Medicaid reimbursement policy and in mandated levels of Medicaid drug rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Many states are facing serious budgetary pressures that could lead to adoption of additional cost-containment measures, including provisions aimed at reducing Medicaid drug prices. Medicaid drug pricing policies also have been subject to periodic revision by Congress, including as part of federal health reform efforts, as discussed below. Further, on February 3, 2011, the HHS announced that it is undertaking a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of actual acquisition costs that states can use to determine state-specific pharmaceutical reimbursement rates; the data will be available to states later this year. There can be no assurances that new state and federal policies will not lower Medicaid reimbursement levels for our products. In March 2010, Congress passed significant health reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, ACA). The legislation is designed to expand access to affordable health insurance through subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and insurance market reforms (including the development of new health benefit exchanges), financed in part through reduced federal health care spending and various taxes and fees. Among many other things, the ACA makes a number of significant changes affecting pharmaceutical manufacturers. With regard to Medicaid drug pricing, the ACA provides for increases to the minimum Medicaid rebate percentages from 15.1% to 23.1%, increased additional rebates for new formulations of brand name drugs, the establishment of a maximum rebate amount, and the extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care organization utilization. In addition, the ACA broadens the definition of average manufacturer price, or AMP, which in turn may have the effect of increasing Medicaid rebate and Public Health Service section 340B drug discount program payment obligations. The ACA also provides that federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis must be set at no less than 175% of the weighted average (based on utilization) of the most recently reported monthly AMP, using a smoothing process. The payments included in the calculation of AMP were further modified by the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act , which was enacted on August 10, 2010. With regard to the Medicare Part D program, the ACA also requires drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on brand-name prescriptions filled in the Medicare Part D coverage gap beginning in 2011. The legislation also provided a $250 payment to Part D beneficiaries who reach the coverage gap during 2010, and mandates the gradual elimination of the coverage gap, beginning in 2011 and finishing in 2020. Moreover, the ACA reduces Part D premium subsidies for higher-income beneficiaries, expands medication therapy management requirements, and makes a number of other revisions to Part D program requirements. In addition, the ACA: extends the 340B program to additional entities, expands oversight of the 340B program, and increases manufacturer reporting requirements; creates an Independent Payment Advisory Board to develop recommendations to reduce Medicare spending under certain circumstances, with such recommendations to go into effect automatically unless Congress adopts alternative savings; expands public disclosure requirements regarding drug manufacturer financial arrangements with physicians; and establishes a licensure pathway for generic versions of biologics. Further, beginning in 2011, manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs and biologics will be assessed an annual fee ($2.5 billion in 2011 and increasing amounts in subsequent years up to $4.1 billion in 2018 and $2.8 billion annually thereafter), with individual company allocations to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, based generally on market share. The IRS recently extended the deadline for filing sales information, and has not yet made preliminary fee calculations for individual manufacturers. There can be no assurances that implementation of the new health reform legislation will not have an adverse impact on revenues, as well as reimbursement and/or coverage of our products. 28 Table of Contents In addition to federal health reform legislation, a number of states have adopted or are considering measures to contain state health care costs and institute other health care coverage and delivery reform, which could impact our reimbursement levels and require us to develop state-specific marketing and sales approaches. Further, a number of states require disclosure of financial arrangements with physicians, marketing expenditures, and the like, and other states may do so in the future; our failure to comply with these as well as the federal disclosure requirements could have an adverse impact. Congress also has enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included a major expansion of federal efforts to compare the effectiveness of different medical treatments, including pharmaceuticals, which eventually could impact Medicare and private payer coverage and payment policies. This comparative effectiveness initiative was expanded by the ACA, and can include studies regarding the comparative clinical effectiveness of drugs. The federal government may consider additional proposals that could lead to coverage or reimbursement constraints and restrictions on access to certain products. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, and it is difficult to predict the impact on our business of future legislative and regulatory changes. We are subject to fraud and abuse and similar government laws and regulations, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations, or an investigation into our compliance with such laws and regulations, or a failure to prevail in any litigation related to noncompliance, could harm our business. We are subject to multiple state and federal laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. Pharmaceutical pricing, sales, and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices in the health care industry generally are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial, and administrative entities. Many health care laws, including the federal and state anti-kickback laws and federal and state statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit government entities to exercise considerable discretion. Further, the ACA contains a number of provisions strengthening the scope of the federal laws, including making a violation under the federal anti-kickback law a predicate action for violation of the federal False Claims Act and expanding the authority for Medicaid exclusions . The ACA also provides that a person need not have actual knowledge of the anti-kickback law, among others, or a specific intent to commit a violation of the law, to be found in violation of it. The ACA further applies the False Claims Act to payments made through new health benefits exchanges if the payments include any federal funds. In the event that government entities believed that wrongdoing had occurred, such entities could institute civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject us to substantial fines, penalties, and injunctive and administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. The adverse outcome of a government investigation also could prompt other government entities to commence investigations, or cause those entities or private parties to bring civil actions against us. We cannot predict whether investigations or enforcement actions would affect our marketing or sales practices. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and our business. Such investigations and enforcement actions could be costly, divert managements attention from our business, and result in damage to our reputation. We cannot guarantee that measures that we have taken to prevent violations, including our corporate compliance program, will protect us from future violations, lawsuits or investigations by governmental entities or private whistleblowers. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant negative impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Failure to adequately ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to whistleblower and government actions. In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have been the targets of extensive whistleblower actions in which the person bringing the action alleges violations of the federal civil False Claims Act or its state equivalent, including allegations that manufacturers aided and abetted in the submission of false claims. These actions have 29 Table of Contents focused on such areas as pricing practices, off-label product promotion, manufacturing deficiencies, sales and marketing practices, and improper relationships with physicians and other health care professionals, among others. The ACA eliminates a number of jurisdictional bars to bringing a false claims action, and therefore may make it easier for whistleblowers to bring successful actions. If our relationships with health care professionals and/or our promotional or other activities are found not to comply with applicable laws, regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or investigative or enforcement action by, regulatory and other federal or state governmental authorities. The potential ramifications are far-reaching if there are areas identified as out of compliance by regulatory agencies and governmental authorities including, but not limited to, significant financial penalties, manufacturing and clinical trial consent decrees, commercialization restrictions, exclusion from government programs, product recalls or seizures, the imposition of corporate integrity agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, or other restrictions and litigation. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to a whistleblower or other state or federal investigative or enforcement action at some time in the future. Even an unsuccessful challenge to our operations or activities could prove costly and divert managements attention. Risks Associated with Our Business and Industry If we do not receive timely regulatory approvals of our product candidates and successfully launch such products, we may need substantial additional funds to support our expanding capital requirements. We have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our research and development and commercial activities. Our operating expenses were approximately $142.2 million and approximately $129.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately $94.3 million on December 31, 2010. Based on current operating plans, we expect our cash and investments to provide liquidity beyond 2011. We expect that our capital and operating expenditures will continue to exceed our revenue over the next several years as we conduct our research and development, licensing, acquisition and/or commercial activities. Many factors will influence our future capital requirements, including:  The number, breadth and progress of our research and development programs;  The level of activities relating to commercialization of our products;  The ability to attract collaborators for our products and establish and maintain those relationships;  The receipt or payment of milestone payments under our current collaborative agreements and any future collaborations;  Progress by our collaborators with respect to the development of product candidates;  Competing technological and market developments;  The timing and terms of any business development activities;  The costs involved in defending any litigation claims against us;  The costs involved in responding to government, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or other applicable investigations against us; and  The costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights. In addition, our capital requirements will depend upon:  The level of net sales generated for AzaSite;  The receipt of revenue from Allergan on net sales of Restasis; 30 Table of Contents  The timing of the introduction of a generic form of Elestat;  The receipt of revenue from wholesalers and other customers on net sales of AzaSite;  The ability to obtain approval from the FDA for our product candidates; and  Payments from existing and future collaborators. In the event that we do not receive timely regulatory approvals, we may need substantial additional funds to support our on-going operations, including business development, product commercialization and co-promotion efforts as well as continue our development activities associated with our product candidates. We may seek such additional funding through public or private equity offerings and debt financings. Additional financing may not be available when needed. If available, such financing may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our stockholders ownership will be diluted if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities. If we are required to raise funds through future collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may have to give up rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on unfavorable terms. If adequate funds are not available, we would have to scale back or terminate research programs and product development and we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate. Our co-promotion and royalty revenues are based, in part, upon Allergans revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies over which we have limited or no control. We recognize co-promotion revenue based on Allergans net sales of Elestat and royalty revenue based on Allergans net sales of Restasis, as defined in the agreements and as reported to us by Allergan. Accordingly, our co-promotion and royalty revenues are based upon Allergans revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies, over which we have limited or no control, and the underlying terms of our agreements. Allergans filings with the SEC indicate that Allergan maintains disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with applicable laws, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be reported by Allergan in its Exchange Act filings is reported timely and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. We are not entitled to review Allergans disclosure controls and procedures. All of our co-promotion and royalty revenues are currently derived from Allergans net sales of Restasis and Elestat as reported to us by Allergan. We are unable to provide complete assurance that Allergan will not revise reported revenue amounts in the future. If Allergans reported revenue amounts were inaccurate, it could have a material impact on our financial statements, including financial statements for prior periods. Revenues in future periods could vary significantly and may not cover our operating expenses. Our revenues may fluctuate from period to period due in part to:  The timing of the introduction of a generic form of Elestat;  Fluctuations in future sales of AzaSite, Restasis and Elestat due to competition, the intensity of an allergy season, disease prevalence, manufacturing difficulties, reimbursement and pricing under commercial or government plans, seasonality, or other factors that affect the sales of a product;  Deductions from gross sales relating to estimates of sales returns, credits and allowances, normal trade and cash discounts, managed care sales rebates and other allocated costs;  The duration of market exclusivity of AzaSite and Restasis;  The timing of approvals, if any, for other possible future products;  The progress toward and the achievement of developmental milestones by us or our partners;  The initiation of new contractual arrangements with other companies; and  The failure or refusal of a collaborative partner to pay royalties or milestone payments. 31 Table of Contents Inventory levels of AzaSite held by wholesalers can also cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly. Although we attempt to monitor wholesaler inventory of our products, we rely upon information provided by third parties to quantify the inventory levels maintained by wholesalers. In addition, we and the wholesalers may not be effective in matching inventory levels to end-user demand. Significant differences between actual and estimated inventory levels and product demand may result in (1) inadequate or excessive (i) inventory production, (ii) product supply in distribution channels, or (iii) product availability at the retail level, and (2) unexpected increases or decreases in orders from our major customers. Any of these events may cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and in some cases may cause our operating results for a particular quarter to be below expectations. If we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated, or in an amount greater than anticipated, we may be unable to continue our operations. We have experienced significant losses since inception. We incurred net losses of approximately $35.4 million and approximately $40.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010, our accumulated deficit was approximately $435.9 million. We currently expect to incur operating losses over the next several years. We expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Such fluctuations will be affected by the timing and level of the following:  Commercialization activities to support AzaSite and Elestat;  Revenues from Restasis;  Regulatory approvals of our product candidates;  Patient demand for our products and any licensed products;  Payments to and from licensors and corporate partners;  Research and development activities;  Investments in new technologies and product candidates; and  The costs involved in defending any litigation claims against, or government investigations of, us. To achieve and sustain profitable operations, we must, alone or with others, develop successfully, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and sell our products. The time frame necessary to achieve market success is long and uncertain. We may not generate sufficient product revenues to become profitable or to sustain profitability. If the time required to achieve profitability is longer than we anticipate, we may not be able to continue our operations. Recent stock market and credit market conditions have been extremely volatile and unpredictable. It is difficult to predict whether these conditions will continue or worsen, and, if so, whether the conditions would impact us and whether such impact could be material. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including commercial banks, investment banks and customers (which include wholesalers, managed care organizations and governments) that may be unstable or may become unstable in the current economic environment. Any such instability may impact these parties ability to fulfill contractual obligations to us or they might limit or place burdensome conditions upon future transactions with us. Customers may also reduce spending during times of economic uncertainty. Also, it is possible that suppliers may be negatively impacted. If such events were to occur, there could be a resulting material and adverse impact on our operations and results of operations. We may decide to access the equity or debt markets to meet capital or liquidity needs. However, the recent constriction and volatility in these markets may restrict our future flexibility to do so when such needs arise. Further, recent economic conditions have resulted in severe downward pressure on the stock and credit markets, which could reduce the return available on invested corporate cash, which if severe and sustained could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 32 Table of Contents Our dependence on collaborative relationships may lead to delays in product development, lost revenues and disputes over rights to technology. Our business strategy depends to some extent upon the formation of research collaborations, licensing and/or marketing arrangements. We currently have collaboration agreements with several companies, including Allergan, InSite Vision and Santen. The termination of any collaboration will result in the loss of any unmet development or commercial milestone payments, may lead to delays in product development and disputes over technology rights, and may reduce our ability to enter into collaborations with other potential partners. In the event we breach an agreement with a collaborator, the collaborator is entitled to terminate our agreement with them in the event we do not cure the breach within a specified period of time, which is typically 60 or 90 days from the notice date. With respect to the Allergan collaboration, in the event we become an affiliate of a third party that manufactures, markets or sells any then currently promoted prescription ophthalmic product, Allergan will have the right to terminate our Elestat co-promotion agreement, which right must be exercised within 3 months of the occurrence of such event. If we do not maintain our current collaborations, or establish additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements, it will be difficult to develop and commercialize potential products. Any future collaborations or licensing arrangements may not be on terms favorable to us. Our current or any future collaborations or licensing arrangements ultimately may not be successful. Under our current strategy, and for the foreseeable future, we do not expect to develop or market products outside North America without a collaborative partner or outside our therapeutic areas of focus. It may be necessary in the future for us to obtain additional licenses to avoid infringement of third-party patents. Additionally, we may enter into license arrangements with other third parties as we build our product portfolio. We do not know the terms on which such licenses may be available, if at all. We will continue to depend on collaborators and/or contractors for research and development, manufacturing and marketing of our potential products. Our agreements with collaborators typically allow them some discretion in electing whether to pursue such activities. If any collaborator were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely and successful manner, the clinical development or commercialization of product candidates or research programs would be delayed or terminated. Any delay or termination in clinical development or commercialization would delay or eliminate potential product revenues relating to our product candidates. Disputes may arise in the future over the ownership of rights to any technology developed with collaborators. These and other possible disagreements between us and our collaborators could lead to delays in the collaborative development or commercialization of products. Such disagreements could also result in litigation or require arbitration to resolve. Failure to hire and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs and our business efforts. We depend on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, including Adrian Adams, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director, and Thomas R. Staab, II, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. If these people leave us, we may have difficulty conducting our operations. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, hire or appoint, and retain additional personnel skilled or experienced in the pharmaceutical industry. There is significant competition for such qualified personnel and we may not be able to attract and retain such personnel. We may not be able to successfully compete with other biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical companies. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. There are many companies seeking to develop products for the same 33 Table of Contents indications that we are working on. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies and specialized biotechnology firms. Most of these competitors have greater resources than we do, including greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. In addition, most of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting clinical trials and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for product candidates more rapidly than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including patent and FDA marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market products. Drugs resulting from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts with our collaborative partners, may not compete successfully with competitors existing products or products under development. Our competitors may also develop technologies and drugs that are safer, more effective, or less costly than any we are developing or which would render our technology and future drugs obsolete and non-competitive. If our intellectual property protection is inadequate, the development and any possible sales of our product candidates could suffer or competitors could force our products completely out of the market. Our business and competitive position depends on our ability to continue to develop and protect our products and processes, proprietary methods and technology and to prevent others from infringing on our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, we or our applicable collaborative partners may lose a significant portion of sales of that product in a short period of time as other companies manufacture generic forms of the previously protected product or manufacture similar products at lower cost, without having had to incur significant research and development costs in formulating the product. Therefore, our future financial success may depend in part on our and our partners obtaining patent protection for technologies incorporated into our products. We cannot be assured that such patents will be issued, or that any existing or future patents will be of commercial benefit. In addition, it is impossible to anticipate the breadth or degree of protection that any such patents will afford, and we cannot be assured that any such patents will not be successfully challenged in the future. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining or preserving patent protection, or if any of our products rely on unpatented proprietary technology, we cannot be assured that others will not commercialize products substantially identical to those products. We also believe that the protection of our trademarks is an important factor in product recognition and in our ability to maintain or increase market share. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our various trademarks from infringement, their value to us could be lost or diminished, seriously impairing our competitive position. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Certain of our patents are use patents containing claims covering methods of treating disorders and diseases by administering therapeutic chemical compounds. Use patents may provide limited protection for commercial efforts in the United States, but may afford a lesser degree of protection, if any, in other countries due to their patent laws. Besides our use patents, we have patents and patent applications covering compositions (new chemical compounds), pharmaceutical formulations and processes for manufacturing our new chemical compounds. Many of the chemical compounds included in the claims of our use patents and process applications were known in the scientific community prior to our patent applications. None of our composition patents or patent applications covers these previously known chemical compounds, which are in the public domain. As a result, competitors may be able to commercialize products that use the same previously known chemical compounds used by us for the treatment of disorders and diseases not covered by our use patents. Such competitors activities may reduce our revenues. 34 Table of Contents Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates or technologies at any time. If we must defend a patent suit, or if we choose to initiate a suit to have a third-party patent declared invalid, or allege infringement of our patents, we may need to make considerable expenditures of money and expend considerable management time in litigation. We believe that there is significant litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. A patent does not provide the patent holder with freedom to operate in a way that infringes the patent rights of others. We may be accused of patent infringement at any time. A judgment against us in a patent infringement action could cause us to pay monetary damages, require us to obtain licenses, or prevent us from manufacturing or marketing the affected products. In addition, we may need to initiate litigation to enforce our proprietary rights against others. Initiation of litigation may result in considerable expenditures of money and management time and may result in our patents being declared invalid. Further, we may need to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine the priority of invention of any of our technologies. Our ability to develop sufficient patent rights in our pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products to support commercialization efforts is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. For instance, the USPTO examiners may not allow our claims in examining our patent applications. If we have to appeal a decision to the USPTOs Appeals Board for a final determination of patentability, we could incur significant legal fees. Lengthy and uncertain patent prosecutions, including the utilization of the appeals process, can add uncertainty, delay and expense to the process of obtaining intellectual property rights for our products, and as such may add delay and uncertainty to the development program for any such product. Use of our products may result in product liability claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Manufacturing, marketing and sale of our products or conducting clinical trials of our product candidates may expose us to liability claims from the use of those products and product candidates. Product liability claims could result in the imposition of substantial liability on us, a recall of products, or a change in the indications for which they may be used. Although we carry product liability insurance and clinical trial liability insurance, we, or our collaborators, may not maintain sufficient insurance to cover these potential claims. We do not have the financial resources to self-insure and it is unlikely that we will have these financial resources in the foreseeable future. If we are unable to protect against potential product liability claims adequately, we may find it difficult or impossible to continue to commercialize our products or the product candidates we develop. If claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage, there could be a resulting material adverse effect on our business. Insurance coverage is increasingly more costly and difficult to obtain or maintain. While we currently have insurance for our business, property, directors and officers, and our products, insurance is increasingly more costly and narrower in scope, and we may be required to assume more risk in the future. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage in excess of our insurance coverage, we will be required to share that risk in excess of our insurance limits. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage that is outside of our insurance coverage, we may incur significant uninsured costs associated with loss or damage that could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Furthermore, any claims made on our insurance policies may impact our ability to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at reasonable costs or at all. 35 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Stock Our common stock price has been volatile and your investment in our stock may decline in value. The market price of our common stock has been volatile. These fluctuations create a greater risk of capital losses for our stockholders as compared to less volatile stocks. Factors that have caused volatility and could cause additional volatility in the market price of our common stock include among others:  Announcements made by us concerning results of clinical trials with our product candidates;  Announcements regarding the commercialization of AzaSite;  Announcements regarding potential FDA approval (or lack thereof) of any of our product candidates;  Market acceptance and market share of AzaSite, Restasis and Elestat;  The timing of the introduction of a generic form of Elestat;  Duration of market exclusivity of AzaSite and Restasis;  Volatility in other securities including pharmaceutical and biotechnology securities;  Changes in government regulations;  Regulatory actions and/or investigations;  Changes in the development priorities of our collaborators that result in changes to, or termination of, our agreements with such collaborators;  Developments concerning proprietary rights including patents by us or our competitors;  Variations in our operating results;  FDA approval of other treatments for the same indication as any one of our product candidates;  Business development activities; and  Litigation. Extreme price and volume fluctuations occur in the stock market and in particular market sectors from time to time that may affect the prices of biotechnology companies. These extreme fluctuations are sometimes unrelated to the actual performance of the affected companies. Warburg is able to exercise substantial control over our business. Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, L.P., or Warburg, holds 22,907,488 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 28% of our outstanding common stock as of January 31, 2011. Warburg and its affiliates may acquire the lesser of: (x) 32.5% of our voting securities on a fully diluted basis and (y) 34.9% of our then outstanding voting securities, without triggering the provisions of our stockholder rights plan. Warburg has the right to designate one person for election to our Board of Directors for so long as Warburg owns a significant percentage of our securities. Pursuant to this right, Jonathan S. Leff serves as a Class C member of the Board of Directors. Pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated July 17, 2007, for so long as Warburg owns at least 10% of the shares of common stock issued upon the exchange of Exchangeable Preferred Stock it acquired in July 2007, it will have subscription rights to acquire a pro rata amount of future issuances of equity securities by us, subject to certain exceptions. As a result of the foregoing, Warburg is able to exercise substantial influence over our business, policies and practices. 36 Table of Contents Our existing principal stockholders hold a substantial amount of our common stock and may be able to influence significant corporate decisions, which may conflict with the interest of other stockholders. As of January 31, 2011, our current 5% and greater stockholders (which includes Warburg) and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 45% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if they act together, may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring approval of the stockholders, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions such as:  a merger or corporate combination with or into another company;  a sale of substantially all of our assets; and  amendments to our certificate of incorporation. The decisions of these individual stockholders may conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders. Future sales and issuances of securities may dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and cause our stock price to decline. Future sales of our common stock by current stockholders into the public market could cause the market price of our stock to fall. As of January 31, 2011, there were 83,172,132 shares of our common stock outstanding. We may from time to time issue securities in relation to a license arrangement, collaboration, merger or acquisition. In addition, on October 6, 2010, we filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. This shelf registration statement has been declared effective and allows us to sell up to $150 million of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares and securities warrants, from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale. As of January 31, 2011, there were 14,392,736 stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and 6,611,750 shares available for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Compensation Plan and equity compensation grants outside such plan. The shares underlying existing stock options and restricted stock units and possible future stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards have been registered pursuant to registration statements on Form S-8. If some or all of such shares are sold or otherwise issued into the public market over a short period of time, our current stockholders ownership interests may be diluted and the value of all publicly traded shares is likely to decline, as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at then-current market prices. Additionally, such sales and issuances may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable, or at all. Our Rights Agreement, the provisions of our Change in Control Severance Benefit Plans, the anti-takeover provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws, standstill agreements, and our right to issue preferred stock, may discourage a third party from making a take-over offer that could be beneficial to us and our stockholders and may make it difficult for stockholders to replace our Board of Directors and effect a change in our management if they desire to do so. In October 2002, we entered into a Rights Agreement with Computershare Trust Company. The Rights Agreement could discourage, delay or prevent a person or group from acquiring 15% or more of our common stock. The Rights Agreement provides that if a person acquires 15% or more of our common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than its fair market value, which would substantially reduce the value of our common stock owned by the acquiring person. As a result, our Board of Directors has significant discretion to approve or disapprove a persons efforts to acquire 15% or more of our common stock. In connection with the transaction with Warburg, we and Computershare entered into a First Amendment to Rights Agreement which provides that 37 Table of Contents Warburg and its affiliates will be exempt from the definition of an Acquiring Person under the Rights Agreement, unless Warburg or certain of its affiliates becomes the beneficial owner of the lesser of: (x) 32.5% of our voting securities on a fully diluted basis and (y) 34.9% of our then outstanding voting securities. In addition to Warburgs ability to exercise substantial control over our business, the First Amendment to Rights Agreement could further discourage, delay or prevent a person or group from acquiring 15% or more of our common stock. As part of the same transaction with Warburg, we entered into a standstill agreement, dated July 20, 2007, pursuant to which Warburg and certain of its affiliates agreed for three years not to increase their holdings of our common stock beyond the levels described above in the First Amendment to Rights Agreement. On August 4, 2009, we amended the standstill agreement to extend its term until August 4, 2012. Our employees are covered under Change in Control Severance Benefit Plans which provide severance benefits in the event they are terminated after a change in control. In addition, the Companys Executive Employment Agreements with Mr. Adams, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Koven, our Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative and Legal Officer, provide for severance benefits in the event of a change of control. These arrangements would increase the acquisition costs to a purchasing company that triggers the change in control provisions and as a result, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions which could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring shares of our common stock or replacing members of our Board of Directors. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors can determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. As a result, our Board of Directors could make it difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Since management is appointed by the Board of Directors, any inability to effect a change in the Board of Directors may result in the entrenchment of management. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation also provides that the members of the Board will be divided into three classes. Each year, the terms of approximately one-third of the directors will expire. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws include director nomination procedures and do not permit our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. The staggering of directors terms of office, the director nomination procedures and the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting may make it difficult for stockholders to remove or replace the Board of Directors should they desire to do so. The director nomination requirements include a provision that requires stockholders give advance notice to our Secretary of any nominations for director or other business to be brought by stockholders at any stockholders meeting. Our directors may be removed from our Board of Directors only for cause. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent changes of control or management, either by third parties or by stockholders seeking to change control or management. In the ordinary course of our business, from time to time we discuss possible collaborations, licenses and other transactions with various third parties, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. When we deem it appropriate, we enter into standstill agreements with such third parties in relation to the discussions. These standstill agreements, several of which may be in force from time-to-time, typically prohibit such parties from acquiring our securities for a period of time. We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an interested stockholder, we may not enter a business combination with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a take-over offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, interested stockholder means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203. In connection with our prior sale of stock to Warburg, we agreed to waive Warburgs acquisition of securities from the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 38 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This annual report on Form 10-K, including the documents that we incorporate by reference, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections.
