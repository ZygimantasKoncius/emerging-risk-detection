ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Not Applicable. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company is in receipt of a comment letter from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, dated December 18, 2009. This letter contained two comments. One comment relates to a request for further information with regard to the Companys Liquidity and Capital Resources disclosure in its form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The second comment relates to extinguishments of certain liabilities recorded by the Company in its 2008 and 2007 consolidated financial statements, which are included in its Forms 10-K for those years. The liabilities extinguished (derecognized) by the Company represented liabilities incurred prior to 2003 by an inactive subsidiary and were derecognized upon the expiration of the applicable State statute of limitations for which a creditor could bring a claim or action against the Company. The Company determined that these liabilities could be extinguished in 2007 and 2008 based on its interpretation of applicable accounting standards and consultations with its legal counsel. Although the Company has determined that it has a legal defense against any such claims, and the possibility of any such claims is remote, the Staff has stated in its December 18, 2009 comment letter that it appears the conditions for derecognition of these liabilities have not been met, and therefore, the financial statements should be revised to reflect such liabilities. The Staff stated that the Company should amend its 2008 Form 10-K or tell the Staff why revision is not required pursuant to applicable accounting standards. Any revision would be accomplished through a restatement of the Companys financial statements for 2007 and 2008 and disclosed in amendments to its 10-K filings. The liabilities amounted to approximately $685,000 in 2007 and $48,000 in 2008. The Company has submitted a response letter to the SEC with regard to these comments providing additional information and reasserting the position that such extinguishments were appropriate, and irrespective of such, that the extinguishments given managements analysis of qualitative and quantitative information available, would not be material to the Company or to an investor. The Company can make no assurance that it will not receive an additional comment letter from the SEC or whether it will in the future make a determination to restate its financial statements as initially proposed by the SEC. If such a restatement were undertaken, the above described amounts would be recorded to the Companys financial statements as non-current liabilities and appropriate adjustments to the 2008 and 2007 statements of income would be required. This would be effected through amendments to the Companys 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and through an amendment to this 2009 Form 10-K filing. 16
