ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We have exposure to economic downturns and operate in cyclical markets. As a supplier of capital equipment to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns. Demand for compressor and vacuum products is dependent upon capital spending by manufacturing and process industries. Many of our customers, particularly industrial customers, will delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Demand for some of our fluid transfer products is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs and oil and natural gas prices. The energy market, in particular, is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates. When worldwide demand for these commodities is depressed, the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced. Accordingly, our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period. The markets for our products have historically experienced downturns in demand. Future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 14 Large or rapid increases in the costs of raw materials or substantial decreases in their availability and our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our primary raw materials are cast iron, aluminum and steel. Although we have some long-term contracts with key suppliers and are seeking to enter into additional long-term contracts, we do not have long-term contracts with most of our suppliers. Consequently, we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials. Factors such as supply and demand, freight costs and transportation availability, inventory levels of brokers and dealers, the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of raw materials. We use single sources of supply for certain iron castings and other select engineered components. From time to time in recent years, we have experienced a disruption to our supply deliveries and may experience further supply disruptions. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers and, therefore, our operating results. We face robust competition in the markets we serve, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We actively compete with many companies producing the same or similar products. Depending on the particular product, we experience competition based on a number of factors, including quality, performance, price and availability. We compete against many companies, including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the economy as a whole. In addition, new competitors could enter our markets. In particular, it is possible that our European- and Asian-based competitors could seek to establish a greater presence in the United States market. If we cannot compete successfully, our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and fully realize the related anticipated cost savings, synergies, or revenue enhancements. We have completed 20 acquisitions since becoming an independent company in 1994, with the three largest transactions occurring since January 2004. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations. We face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, personnel, product lines, and operations in a timely and efficient manner. The integration process can be complex and time consuming, may be disruptive to our existing and acquired businesses, and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, those businesses. Even if we can successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses into our operations, there is no assurance that anticipated cost savings, synergies, or revenue enhancements will be realized within the expected time frame, or at all. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies, or revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:  our ability to effectively eliminate redundant administrative overhead and rationalize manufacturing capacity is difficult to predict. Accordingly, the actual amount and timing of the resulting cost savings are inherently difficult to predict.  we may incur significant cash integration costs in achieving cost savings, and any cost savings or other synergies from acquisitions may be offset by such integration costs.  the cost savings and other synergies realized from acquisitions may be offset by increases in other expenses, by operating losses, or by problems unrelated to any specific acquisition. Our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, particularly our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Ross J. Centanni, could have an adverse impact. None of our executive officers has an employment agreement. However, we have a common stock ownership requirement and provide certain benefits for our executive officers, including change in control agreements, which provide incentives for them to make a long-term commitment to our company. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations. 15 We may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us to realize our growth strategy. One of our growth strategies is to increase our sales and expand our markets through acquisitions. We expect to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise. However, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions. Furthermore, our acquired companies may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources, which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 58% of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the United States. We have manufacturing facilities in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, China, Finland, Brazil and Canada. We anticipate that we may continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available. Non-U.S. operations and U.S. export sales could be adversely affected as a result of:  nationalization of private enterprises;  political or economic instability in certain countries;  differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;  changes in the legal and regulatory policies of foreign jurisdictions;  credit risks;  currency fluctuations;  exchange controls;  changes in tariff restrictions;  royalty and tax increases;  export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;  potential problems obtaining supply of raw materials;  shipping products during times of crisis or war; and  other factors inherent in foreign operations. The nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims, which could harm our business. Customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. In addition, our products are integral to the production process for some end-users and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations. Although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures, we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects. We maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size. However, we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred. We also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable. We may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used. 16 Environmental-compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. Under such laws and regulations, we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We must conform our operations and properties to these laws and regulations. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal Superfund or similar state laws. An accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs which are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters. If we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations, we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with regulatory requirements relating to environmental matters, and many environmental laws impose joint and several liability for remediation for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We have been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits. The plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources, and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants. In our experience to date, the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which we bear responsibility. We believe that the pending lawsuits will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, future developments, including, without limitation, potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants, could cause a different outcome. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We have debt of approximately $407 million at December 31, 2006, and our indebtedness could have an adverse future effect on our business. For example:  we may have a limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy, or other purposes;  a portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;  the various covenants contained in our senior credit agreement, the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes, and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to some of our competitors; and 17  borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates. If we remain in compliance with the covenants set forth in the documents governing our indebtedness, we and/or our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we now face may intensify. Third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property, and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury. Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality provisions, contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be costly and time consuming, and can divert managements attention and other resources. Depending on the resolution of such claims, we may be barred from using a specific technology or other right, may be required to redesign or re-engineer a product, or may become liable for significant damages. Our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages or other labor difficulties. As of January 2007, we have approximately 6,000 full-time employees. A significant number of our employees, including a large portion of the employees outside of the United States, are represented by works councils and labor unions. Although we do not anticipate future work stoppages by our union employees, there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur. Although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages, we cannot be assured that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. The occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs and/or decreased operating results. Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense (or income) are dependent upon assumptions used in calculating such amounts and actual results of investment activity. Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense (or income) are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts and actual results of investment activity. These assumptions include discount rate, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates. While we believe that the assumptions are appropriate, differences in actual experience or future changes in assumptions may affect our obligations, future expense and funding requirements. A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets, the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. As of December 31, 2006, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $873.2 million, or 49.9% of our total assets. Goodwill is generated in an acquisition when the cost of such acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are subject to impairment analyses at least annually. We could be required to recognize reductions in our net income caused by the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, which, if significant, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 18 ITEM 1B.
