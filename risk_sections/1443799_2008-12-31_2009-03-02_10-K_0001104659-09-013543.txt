ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on managements current expectations and observations. Included among the factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are the following: (i) loss or reduction in business from our significant customers; (ii) the failure of our significant customers to perform their obligations owed to us; (iii) changes in demand; (iv) a material decline or prolonged weakness in rates in the tanker market; (v) changes in production of or demand for oil and petroleum products, generally or in particular regions; (vi) greater than anticipated levels of tanker newbuilding orders or lower than anticipated rates of tanker scrapping; (vii) changes in rules and regulations applicable to the tanker industry, including, without limitation, legislation adopted by international organizations such as the International Maritime Organization and the European Union or by individual countries; (viii) actions taken by regulatory authorities; (ix) changes in trading patterns significantly impacting overall tanker tonnage requirements; (x) changes in the typical seasonal variations in tanker charter rates; (xi) changes in the cost of other modes of oil transportation; (xii) changes in oil transportation technology; (xii) increases in costs including without limitation: crew wages, insurance, provisions, repairs and maintenance; (xiv) changes in general domestic and international political conditions; (xv) changes in the condition of our vessels or applicable maintenance or regulatory standards (which may affect, among other things, our anticipated drydocking or maintenance and repair costs); (xvi) changes in the itineraries of the Companys vessels; (xvii) adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our expenses; and other factors listed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our ability to pay dividends in any period will depend upon factors including applicable provisions of Marshall Islands law and the final determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance. The timing and amount of dividends, if any, could also be affected by factors affecting cash flows, results of operations, required capital expenditures, or reserves. As a result, the amount of dividends actually paid may vary. We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our business, including market, financial, operational, legal and regulatory risks. Below, we have described certain important risks that could affect our business. These risks and other information included in this report should be carefully considered. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS & OPERATIONS Our recent business combination with Arlington exposes us to a number of significant risks. There are a number of significant risks associated with our recent business combination with Arlington, including: 25 · risks associated with our ability to successfully integrate the operations and business of Arlington, and the related diversion of management resources necessary to integrate the businesses; · risks associated with our ability to realize the full projected cost savings and benefits in connection with the transaction; and · expenses related to the transaction. We may incur adverse consequences in connection with our executive transition. As we previously announced, on October 24, 2008, in connection with the recent Arlington Combination, we entered into a new letter agreement with Peter Georgiopoulos. Pursuant to its terms, the new letter agreement became effective as of December 16, 2008, the date on which the effective time of the Arlington Combination occurred, the Effective Date. This letter agreement provided that, among other things: the employment letter agreement, dated April 5, 2005, between General Maritime Subsidiary and Peter Georgiopoulos terminated on the Effective Date (and Peter Georgiopoulos stepped down as President and CEO); and Peter Georgiopoulos will serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the new combined company for three years following the Effective Date, or earlier if he is not nominated to such position or if our shareholders decline to re-elect him to, or remove him from, our Board of Directors. On the Effective Date, John Tavlarios, CEO of our management subsidiary, became President of the Company. The loss of Peter Georgiopoulos full-time service could have an adverse effect on our operations. The Arlington Combination may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers. In response to the Arlington Combination, existing or prospective customers or suppliers of the Company, General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington may: · delay, defer or cease purchasing services from or providing goods or services to the Company, General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington; · delay or defer other decisions concerning the Company, General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington, or refuse to extend credit to the Company, General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington; · raise disputes under their business arrangements with the Company, General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington or assert purported consent or change of control rights; or · otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with the Company, General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington. Any such delays, disputes or changes to terms could seriously harm our business. The current global economic turndown may negatively impact our business. Recent months have seen a significant shift in the global economy, with operating businesses facing tightening credit, weakening demand for goods and services, deteriorating international liquidity conditions, and declining markets. Lower demand for tanker cargoes as well as diminished trade credit available for the delivery of such cargoes may create downward pressure on charter rates. If the current global economic environment persists or worsens, we may be negatively affected in the following ways · We may not be able to employ our vessels at charter rates as favorable to us as historical rates or operate our vessels profitably. · The market value of our vessels could decrease significantly, which may cause us to recognize losses if any of our vessels are sold or if their values are impaired. In addition, such a decline in the market value of our vessels could prevent us from borrowing under our credit facilities or trigger a default under their covenants. 26 · Charterers could seek to renegotiate the terms of their charterers with us or have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us. The cyclical nature of the tanker industry may lead to volatility in charter rates and vessel values which may adversely affect our earnings. If the tanker market, which has been cyclical, is depressed in the future, our earnings and available cash flow may decrease. Our ability to employ our vessels profitably will depend upon, among other things, economic conditions in the tanker market. Fluctuations in charter rates and tanker values result from changes in the supply and demand for tanker capacity and changes in the supply and demand for petroleum and petroleum products. The factors affecting the supply and demand for tankers are outside of our control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable. The current global financial crisis has intensified this unpredictability. The factors that influence demand for tanker capacity include: · demand for and supply of petroleum and petroleum products, · regional availability of refining capacity, · environmental and other regulatory developments, · global and regional economic conditions, · the distance petroleum and petroleum products are to be moved by sea, and · changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns. The factors that influence the supply of tanker capacity include: · the number of newbuilding deliveries, · the scrapping rate of older vessels, · conversion of tankers to other uses, · the number of vessels that are out of service, and · environmental concerns and regulations. Historically, the tanker markets have been volatile as a result of the many conditions and factors that can affect the price, supply and demand for tanker capacity. Changes in demand for transportation of oil over longer distances and supply of tankers to carry that oil may materially affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Charter rates for vessels may decrease in the future, which may adversely affect our earnings and ability to pay dividends. We anticipate that future demand for our vessels, and in turn our future charter rates, will be affected by the rate of economic growth in the worlds economy as well as seasonal and regional changes in demand and changes in the capacity of the worlds fleet. If the tanker industry, which has been highly cyclical, is depressed in the future when our charters expire or at a time when we may want to sell a vessel, our earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully charter our vessels in the future or renew our existing charters at rates sufficient to allow us to operate our business profitably, meet our obligations 27 including payment of debt service to our lenders or to pay dividends to our shareholders. Our ability to renew the charters on our vessels on the expiration or termination of our current charters, the charter rates payable under any replacement charters and vessel values will depend upon, among other things, economic conditions in the tanker industry at that time, changes in the supply and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the seaborne transportation of crude oil. A general global economic downturn or international financial uncertainty may result in a weakening of charter rates. This could reduce the charter rates for our vessels not then subject to long-term charters and, thereby, negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, the Arlington Vessels, are currently chartered to subsidiaries of Concordia and Stena. We receive a fixed minimum daily base charter rate, or basic hire, under these charters and may also receive additional hire based on a formula of notional voyages and expenses on routes agreed to with these charterers. Currently, the payments received by us under these charters are below market compared to the time charter market generally. There is no obligation to pay additional hire during any period when the obligation to pay basic hire is suspended under the charter if due to technical reasons the vessel is off-hire. These charterers have options which they may exercise in their sole discretion to extend the terms of the charters for each of the Arlington Vessels, four of which options were exercised in May 2008. Notice that the charterer is exercising its option to extend the term of a charter is required to be delivered no later than six months prior to the expiration of the charter period in effect at that time. We cannot predict whether the charterers will exercise any additional extension options under one or more of the charters. If these charterers decide not to extend their current charters, we may not be able to re-charter the Arlington Vessels with terms similar to the terms of the current charters, or at all. We may also directly employ these vessels on the spot charter market, which is subject to greater rate fluctuation than the time charter market. An over supply of new vessels may adversely affect charter rates and vessel values. If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of tankers being scrapped and lost, tanker capacity will increase. In addition, we believe that the total newbuilding order books for Suezmax vessels and Aframax vessels scheduled to enter the fleet through 2012 currently are a substantial portion of the existing fleets and we cannot assure you that the order books will not increase further in proportion to the existing fleets. If the supply of tanker capacity increases and the demand for tanker capacity does not increase correspondingly, charter rates could materially decline and the value of our vessels could be adversely affected. Our revenues may be adversely affected if we do not successfully employ our vessels. We seek to deploy our vessels between spot market voyage charters and time charters in a manner that maximizes long-term cash flow. Currently, 23 of our vessels are contractually committed to time charters, with the remaining terms of these charters expiring on dates between July 2009 and July 2011. Although these time charters generally provide stable revenues, they also limit the portion of our fleet available for spot market voyages during an upswing in the tanker industry cycle, when spot market voyages might be more profitable. We earned approximately 26% of our net voyage revenue from spot charters for the year ended December 31, 2008. The spot charter market is highly competitive, and spot market voyage charter rates may fluctuate dramatically based primarily on the worldwide supply of tankers available in the market for the transportation of oil and the worldwide demand for the transportation of oil by tanker. Factors affecting the volatility of spot market voyage charter rates include the quantity of oil produced globally, shifts in locations where oil is produced or consumed, actions by OPEC, the general level of worldwide economic activity and the development and use of alternative energy sources. We cannot assure you that future spot market voyage charters will be available at rates that will allow us to operate our vessels profitably. We receive a significant portion of our revenues from a single customer, and any decrease in the amount of business it or any other significant customer transacts with us could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and profitability. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our single largest customer, Lukoil Oil Company, or Lukoil. During the year ended December 31, 2008, Lukoil accounted for 40.8% of our voyage revenues and we expect Lukoil to account for a significant portion of our voyage revenues in the future. Ten of our 23 time charters are with Lukoil. We also derive a significant portion of our voyage revenues from time charters by subsidiaries of Concordia 28 and Stena. During the year ended December 31, 2008, these customers accounted for all of Arlingtons voyage revenues and we expect these customers to account for a significant portion of our voyage revenues in the future. All eight Arlington Vessels are on time charters with the Concordia and Stena subsidiaries. Our revenues other than Lukoil revenues, Concordia and Stena are also derived from a limited number of customers. If Lukoil or one of the Concordia and Stena subsidiaries breaches or terminates these time charters or renegotiates or renews them on terms less favorable than those currently in effect, or if any significant customer decreases the amount of business it transacts with us or if we lose any of our customers or a significant portion of our revenues, our operating results, cash flows and profitability could be materially adversely affected. A decline in demand for crude oil or a shift in oil transport patterns could materially and adversely affect our revenues. The demand for tanker capacity to transport crude oil depends upon world and regional oil markets. A number of factors influence these markets, including: · global and regional economic conditions; · increases and decreases in production of and demand for crude oil; · developments in international trade; · changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns; · environmental concerns and regulations; and · weather. Historically, the crude oil markets have been volatile as a result of the many conditions and events that can affect the price, demand, production and transport of oil, including competition from alternative energy sources. Decreased demand for oil transportation may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability. The market for crude oil transportation services is highly competitive and we may not be able to effectively compete. Our vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Our competitors include the owners of other Aframax and Suezmax tankers and, to a lesser degree, owners of other size tankers. Both groups include independent oil tanker companies as well as oil companies. We do not control a sufficiently large share of the market to influence the market price charged for crude oil transportation services. Our market share may decrease in the future. We may not be able to compete profitably as we expand our business into new geographic regions or provide new services. New markets may require different skills, knowledge or strategies than we use in our current markets, and the competitors in those new markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than we do. The market value of our vessels may fluctuate significantly, and we may incur losses when we sell vessels following a decline in their market value. The fair market value of our vessels may increase and decrease depending on a number of factors including: · general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry; · competition from other shipping companies; · supply and demand for tankers and the types and sizes of tankers we own; 29 · alternative modes of transportation; · cost of newbuildings; · governmental or other regulations; · prevailing level of charter rates; and · technological advances. If the fair market value of our vessels declines below their carrying values and such decline is other than temporary, we may be required to take an impairment charge or may incur losses if we were to sell one or more of our vessels at such time, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition as well as our earnings. We may not be able to grow or to effectively manage our growth. A principal focus of our strategy is to continue to grow by taking advantage of changing market conditions, which may include expanding our business in the Atlantic basin, the primary geographic area and market where we operate, expanding into other regions, or increasing the number of vessels in our fleet. Our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, some of which we can control and some of which we cannot. These factors include our ability to: · identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning vessels for acquisitions or joint ventures; · identify vessels and/or shipping companies for acquisitions; · integrate any acquired businesses or vessels successfully with our existing operations; · hire, train and retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and fleet; · identify additional new markets outside of the Atlantic basin; · improve our operating and financial systems and controls; and · obtain required financing for our existing and new operations. Our ability to grow is in part dependent on our ability to expand our fleet through acquisitions of suitable double-hull vessels. We may not be able to acquire newbuildings or secondhand double-hull tankers on favorable terms, which could impede our growth and negatively impact our financial condition and ability to pay dividends. We may not be able to contract for newbuildings or locate suitable secondhand double-hull vessels or negotiate acceptable construction or purchase contracts with shipyards and owners, or obtain financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. The failure to effectively identify, purchase, develop and integrate any vessels or businesses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operating results may fluctuate seasonally. We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in tanker demand and, as a result, in charter rates. Tanker markets are typically stronger in the fall and winter months (the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year) in anticipation of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter months. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt vessel scheduling. 30 Because we generate all of our revenues in U.S. Dollars but incur a significant portion of our expenses in other currencies, exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We generate all of our revenues in U.S. Dollars but we incur a significant portion of our expenses, particularly crew and maintenance costs, in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This difference could lead to fluctuations in net income due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollars relative to the other currencies, in particular the Euro. A decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar could lead to higher expenses payable by us. There may be risks associated with the purchase and operation of secondhand vessels. Our current business strategy may include additional growth through the acquisition of additional secondhand vessels. Although we inspect secondhand vessels prior to purchase, this does not normally provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have had if such vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Therefore, our future operating results could be negatively affected if some of the vessels do not perform as we expect. Also, we do not receive the benefit of warranties from the builders if the vessels we buy are older than one year. Delays or defaults by the shipyards in the construction of any new vessels that we may order could increase our expenses and diminish our net income and cash flows. Our business strategy may include additional growth through constructing new vessels or acquiring newbuilding contracts. Any such projects would be subject to the risk of delay or defaults by shipyards caused by, among other things, unforeseen quality or engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, delays in receipt of necessary equipment, and inability to obtain the requisite permits or approvals. In accordance with industry practice, in the event any such shipyards are unable or unwilling to deliver the vessels ordered, we may not have substantial remedies. Failure to construct or deliver vessels by the shipyards or any significant delays could increase our expenses and diminish our net income and cash flows. An increase in costs could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our vessel operating expenses are comprised of a variety of costs including crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs, many of which are beyond our control and affect the entire shipping industry. Also, costs such as insurance and security are still increasing. If costs continue to rise, that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and profitability. We may face unexpected repair costs for our vessels. Repairs and maintenance costs are difficult to predict with certainty and may be substantial. Many of these expenses are not covered by our insurance. Large repair expenses could decrease our cash flow and profitability and reduce our liquidity. Compliance with safety and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be very costly and may adversely affect our business. The hull and machinery of every commercial tanker must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the Safety of Life at Sea Convention. All of our vessels are certified as being in-class by Det Norske Veritas or the American Bureau of Shipping. These classification societies are members of the International Association of Classification Societies. A vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessels machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Our vessels are on special survey cycles for hull inspection and on special survey or continuous survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel is also required to be drydocked every two to five years for inspection of the underwater parts of such vessel. 31 If a vessel in our fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey or special survey, it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports. This would negatively impact our results of operations. We depend on our key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, including ships officers, in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our future success depends particularly on the continued service of John Tavlarios, our President. We may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees or crew necessary to operate our business. Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. In crewing our vessels, we require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically demanding work. Competition to attract and retain qualified crew members is intense. We expect crew costs to increase in 2009. If we are not able to increase our rates to compensate for any crew cost increases, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Any inability we experience in the future to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business. Shipping is an inherently risky business and our insurance may not be adequate. Our vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters, bad weather, mechanical failures, human error, war, terrorism, piracy and other circumstances or events. In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes and boycotts. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues, increased costs and decreased cash flows. Future hostilities or other political instability could affect our trade patterns and adversely affect our operations and our revenues, cash flows and profitability. We carry insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. We currently maintain $1 billion in coverage for each of our vessels for liability for spillage or leakage of oil or pollution. We also carry insurance covering lost revenue resulting from vessel off-hire for all of our vessels. Nonetheless, risks may arise against which we are not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future and we cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover our losses, we may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. We may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability. Our payment of these calls could result in significant expenses to us which could reduce our cash flows and place strains on our liquidity and capital resources. The risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our operations. In general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase as the vessel ages. As of December 31, 2008, the average age of the 31 vessels in our fleet was 8.6 years compared to an average age of 9.6 years as of December 31, 2007. Due to improvements in engine technology, older vessels typically are less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. 32 Governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of tankers may require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment to our vessels, and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage. We cannot assure you that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify any required expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have recently increased in frequency, which could adversely affect our business. Acts of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea and in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. Throughout 2008, the frequency of piracy incidents has increased significantly, particularly in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. If these piracy attacks result in regions in which our vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as war risk zones, as the Gulf of Aden temporarily was in May 2008, or Joint War Committee (JWC) war and strikes listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. In addition, crew costs, including costs which may be incurred to the extent we employ onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks, increased hostilities or war could lead to further economic instability, increased costs and disruption of our business. Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in the United States on September 11, 2001, the bombings in Spain on March 11, 2004, the bombings in London on July 7, 2005, and the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and other current and future conflicts, may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, ability to raise capital and future growth. Continuing hostilities in the Middle East may lead to additional armed conflicts or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the United States or elsewhere, which may contribute further to economic instability. In addition, oil facilities, shipyards, vessels, pipelines and oil and gas fields could be targets of future terrorist attacks. Any such attacks could lead to, among other things, bodily injury or loss of life, vessel or other property damage, increased vessel operational costs, including insurance costs, and the inability to transport oil and other refined products to or from certain locations. Terrorist attacks, war or other events beyond our control that adversely affect the distribution, production or transportation of oil and other refined products to be shipped by us could entitle our customers to terminate our charter contracts, which would harm our cash flow and our business. Compliance with safety, environmental and other governmental requirements and related costs may adversely affect our operations. The shipping industry in general, our business and the operation of our vessels in particular, are affected by a variety of governmental regulations in the form of numerous international conventions, national, state and local laws and national and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which such tankers operate, as well as in the country or countries in which such tankers are registered. These regulations include: · the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which imposes strict liability for the discharge of oil into the 200-mile United States exclusive economic zone, the obligation to obtain certificates of financial responsibility for vessels trading in United States waters and the requirement that newly constructed tankers that trade in United States waters be constructed with double-hulls; · the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 entered into by many countries (other than the United States) which imposes strict liability for pollution damage caused by the discharge of oil; 33 · the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships adopted and implemented under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, with respect to strict technical and operational requirements for tankers; · the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974, or SOLAS, which imposes crew and passenger safety requirements; · the International Ship and Port Facilities Securities Code, or the ISPS Code, which became effective in 2004; · the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966 which imposes requirements relating to the safeguarding of life and property through limitations on load capability for vessels on international voyages; and · the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 which imposes security requirements for tankers entering U.S. ports. More stringent maritime safety rules are also likely to be imposed worldwide as a result of the oil spill in November 2002 relating to the loss of the M.T. Prestige, a 26-year old single-hull tanker owned by a company not affiliated with us. Additional laws and regulations may also be adopted that could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business and that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. We believe our vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety/environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as our management deems appropriate. The vessels operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessels required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact may change in the future and require us to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to our ships to keep them in compliance. Increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business. International shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination. Inspection procedures can result in the seizure of contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading or delivery and the levying of customs, duties, fines and other penalties against us. It is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Furthermore, changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends. Our vessels may be requisitioned by governments without adequate compensation. A government could requisition for title or seize our vessels. In the case of a requisition for title, a government takes control of a vessel and becomes its owner. Also, a government could requisition our vessels for hire. Under requisition for hire, a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes its charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Although we, as owner, would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition, the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain. Increases in tonnage taxes on our vessels would increase the costs of our operations. Our vessels are currently registered under the flags of the Republic of Liberia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Bermuda. These jurisdictions impose taxes based on the tonnage capacity of each of the vessels registered 34 under their flag. The tonnage taxes imposed by these countries could increase, which would cause the costs of our operations to increase. Arrests of our vessels by maritime claimants could cause a significant loss of earnings for the related off hire period. Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by arresting or attaching a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could result in a significant loss of earnings for the related off-hire period. In addition, in jurisdictions where the sister ship theory of liability applies, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimants maritime lien and any associated vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. In countries with sister ship liability laws, claims might be asserted against us, any of our subsidiaries or our vessels for liabilities of other vessels that we own. Proceedings involving General Maritime vessel-owning subsidiaries and two General Maritime vessel officers could negatively impact our business. On November 25, 2008, a jury in the Southern District of Texas found General Maritime Management (Portugal) L.D.A., a subsidiary of ours (GMM Portugal), and two vessel officers of the Genmar Defiance guilty of violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships and 18 USC 1001. The conviction resulted from charges based on alleged incidents occurring on board the Genmar Defiance arising from potential failures by shipboard staff to properly record discharges of bilge waste during the period of November 24, 2007 through November 26, 2007. We have denied any wrongdoing in this matter by us or any of our employees. The continuation of the sentencing hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2009. The unfavorable verdict could result in criminal sanctions or civil remedies against us, such as material fines, injunctions or the loss of our ability to conduct business with governmental entities and could also negatively affect our relationships with our customers and have an adverse impact on our business. On or about August 29, 2007, an oil sheen was discovered by shipboard personnel of the Genmar Progress in Guayanilla Bay, Puerto Rico in the vicinity of the vessel. We understand the federal and Puerto Rico authorities are conducting civil investigations into an oil pollution incident which occurred during this time period on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico including Guayanilla Bay. The extent to which oil discharged from the Genmar Progress is responsible for this incident is currently the subject of investigation. The U.S. Coast Guard has designated the Genmar Progress as a potential source of discharged oil. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the source of the discharge is liable, regardless of fault, for damages and oil spill remediation as a result of the discharge. On January 19, 2009, we received a demand from the U.S. National Pollution Fund for $5.8 million for the U.S. Coast Guards response costs and certain costs of the Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales of Puerto Rico in connection with the alleged damage to the environment caused by the spill. We are reviewing the demand and has requested additional information from the U.S. National Pollution Fund relating to the demand. Currently, no charges have been made and no other fines or penalties have been levied against us. We have been cooperating in these investigations and have posted a surety bond to cover potential fines or penalties that may be imposed in connection with the matter. This matter, including the demand from the U.S. National Pollution Fund, has been reported to our protection and indemnity insurance underwriters. We have not accrued reserves for this incident other than the deductible because the amount of any additional costs that may be incurred by us is not estimable at this time. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business and financial condition. We may have to pay U.S. tax on U.S. source income, which would reduce our net income and cash flows. If we do not qualify for an exemption pursuant to Section 883 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, which we refer to as Section 883, then we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our 35 shipping income that is derived from U.S. sources. If we are subject to such tax, our net income and cash flows would be reduced by the amount of such tax. We will qualify for exemption under Section 883 if, among other things, our stock is treated as primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States. Under applicable Treasury regulations, we may not satisfy this publicly traded requirement in any taxable year in which 50% or more of our stock is owned for more than half the days in such year by persons who actually or constructively own 5% or more of our stock, which we sometimes refer to as 5% shareholders. We believe that, based on the ownership of our stock in 2008, we satisfied the publicly traded requirement for 2008. However, if 5% shareholders were to own more than 50% of our common stock for more than half the days of any future taxable year, we may not be eligible to claim exemption from tax under Section 883 for such taxable year. We can provide no assurance that changes and shifts in the ownership of our stock by 5% shareholders will not preclude us from qualifying for exemption from tax in 2009 or in future years. If we do not qualify for the Section 883 exemption, our shipping income derived from U.S. sources, or 50% of our gross shipping income attributable to transportation beginning or ending in the United States, would be subject to a 4% tax without allowance for deductions. U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders. A foreign corporation generally will be treated as a passive foreign investment company, which we sometimes refer to as a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of passive income or (2) at least 50% of its assets (averaged over the year and generally determined based upon value) produce or are held for the production of passive income. U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to distributions they receive from the PFIC and gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their stock in the PFIC. For purposes of these tests, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business, as defined in applicable Treasury regulations. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute passive income unless we were treated under specific rules as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business. We do not believe that our existing operations or the past operations of General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington would cause us, or would have caused General Maritime Subsidiary or Arlington, to be deemed a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. In this regard, we treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time and spot chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that (1) our income from our time and spot chartering activities does not constitute passive income and (2) the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets. There is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our method of operation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which we sometimes refer to as the IRS, or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, because there are uncertainties in the application of the PFIC rules, because the PFIC test is an annual test, and because, although we intend to manage our business so as to avoid PFIC status to the extent consistent with our other business goals, there could be changes in the nature and extent of our operations in future years, there can be no assurance that we will not become a PFIC in any taxable year. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year (and regardless of whether we remain a PFIC for subsequent taxable years), our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the Code (which elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder, such shareholder would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income upon the receipt of excess distributions and upon any gain from the 36 disposition of our common stock, plus interest on such amounts, as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholders holding period of our common stock. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR FINANCINGS Our 2005 Credit Facility and our RBS credit facility will impose, and it is possible that any indenture for debt securities we may issue will impose, significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. Our 2005 Credit Facility and our RBS credit facility, as and to the extent amended or otherwise modified, will impose, and it is possible that any indenture for debt securities that we may issue will impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit our ability to, among other things: · incur additional debt; · pay dividends or make other restricted payments; · create or permit certain liens; · sell vessels or other assets; · create or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; · engage in transactions with affiliates; and · consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets. On October 20, 2008, in connection with the proposed transaction, we amended and restated the 2005 Credit Facility. Under the amended and restated credit agreement, we are permitted to pay dividends at a rate not to exceed $0.50 per common share per quarter on the Companys common stock. This covenant applies to dividends and other distributions, including stock buy-backs, in respect of the Companys shares. Under the amended and restated credit agreement, the Company is also permitted to pay additional dividends in a cumulative amount not to exceed the sum of $150 million and 50% of the Companys cumulative net excess cash flow (as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement). In addition, the amended and restated credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial covenants. We may be required to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives to meet these ratios and satisfy these covenants. Events beyond our control, including changes in the economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants. We cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios or satisfy these covenants or that our lenders will waive any failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios under, the amended and restated credit agreement would prevent us from borrowing additional money under the facility and could result in a default under it. If a default occurs under the amended and restated credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare that debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against the collateral securing that debt, which constitutes all or substantially all of our assets. Moreover, if the lenders under the amended and restated credit agreement or other agreement in default were to accelerate the debt outstanding under that facility, it could result in a default under our other debt obligations that may exist at such time, including any debt securities. Our RBS credit facility requires that Arlington comply with various operating covenants and maintain certain financial ratios including that the market value of the Arlington Vessels exceeds 125% of the total facility amount outstanding and that, in order for Arlington to pay a dividend, the market value of the Arlington Vessels exceeds 140% of its borrowings (or 125% of the loan amount if at the time of such dividend all of the Arlington Vessels are on time charter for a remaining period of at least 12 months). Our RBS credit facility also requires that Northern 37 Marine remain as technical manager for the Arlington Vessels. In the event of the sale or loss of an Arlington Vessel, we might be required to repay a percentage of the loan earlier than we planned or increase our payments under the facility, which could affect our financial condition and ability to make payments to our shareholders. Declining tanker values could adversely affect our ability to refinance our RBS credit facility at its maturity in January 2011, and thereby adversely impact our business and operations and liquidity. These restrictions could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. We have incurred significant indebtedness which could affect our ability to finance our operations, pursue desirable business opportunities or successfully run our business in the future. As of December 31, 2008, we have borrowed $761 million under our 2005 Credit Facility and $229.5 million under our RBS credit facility. Our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant consequences, including the following: · If future cash flows are insufficient, we may need to incur further indebtedness in order to make the capital expenditures and other expenses or investments planned by us. · Our indebtedness will have the general effect of reducing our flexibility to react to changing business and economic conditions insofar as they affect our financial condition and, therefore, may pose substantial risk to our stockholders. · In the event that we are liquidated, any of our senior or subordinated creditors and any senior or subordinated creditors of our subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full prior to any distributions to the holders of our shares of common stock. · Our 2005 Credit Facility begins to amortize in February 2009 and our RBS Facility matures in January 2011. Our ability to secure additional financing prior to or after that time, if needed, may be substantially restricted by the existing level of our indebtedness and the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. When our credit facilities mature in 2011 and 2012, we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of such debt, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our credit facilities. Fluctuations in the market value of our fleet may adversely affect our liquidity and may result in breaches under our financing arrangements and sales of vessels at a loss. The market value of vessels fluctuates depending upon general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, the number of tankers in the world fleet, the price of constructing new tankers, or newbuildings, types and sizes of tankers, and the cost of other modes of transportation. The market value of our fleet may decline as a result of a downswing in the historically cyclical shipping industry or as a result of the aging of our fleet. Declining tanker values could affect our ability to raise cash by limiting our ability to refinance vessels and thereby adversely impact our liquidity. In addition, declining vessel values could result in a breach of loan covenants, which could give rise to events of default under our credit facilities. Due to the cyclical nature of the tanker market, the market value of one or more of our vessels may at various times be lower than their book value, and sales of those vessels during those times would result in losses. If we determine at any time that a vessels future limited useful life and earnings require us to impair its value on our financial statements, that could result in a charge against our earnings and the reduction of our shareholders equity. If for any reason we sell vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than the vessels carrying amount on our financial statements, with the result that we would also incur a loss and a reduction in earnings. 38 If we default under our 2005 Credit Facility or the RBS Facility, we could forfeit our rights in certain of our vessels and their charters. We have pledged 11 of our Suezmax vessels and 11 of our Aframax vessels as security to the lenders under our 2005 Credit Facility We have pledged the Arlington Vessels as security to the lenders under our RBS facility. Default under these loan agreements, if not waived or modified, would permit the lenders to foreclose on the mortgages over the vessels and the related collateral, and we could lose our rights in the vessels and their charters. When final payment is due under our loan agreements, we must repay any borrowings outstanding, including balloon payments. To the extent that our cash flows are insufficient to repay any of these borrowings, we will need to refinance some or all of our loan agreements or replace them with an alternate credit arrangement. We may not be able to refinance or replace our loan agreements at the time they become due. In addition, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangement may restrict our financial and operating flexibility. We are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial and other obligations. We are a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our vessels. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay dividends depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, restrictions under our credit facilities, applicable corporate and limited liability company laws of the jurisdictions of their incorporation or organization and other laws and regulations. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we will not be able to pay dividends or make payment on our credit facilities unless we obtain funds from other sources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources. 39 RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Anti-takeover provisions in our financing agreements and organizational documents could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our existing financing agreement imposes restrictions on changes of control of our company and our ship-owning subsidiaries. These include requirements that we obtain the lenders consent prior to any change of control and that we make an offer to redeem certain indebtedness before a change of control can take place. Several provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: · authorizing our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval; · providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; · prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless certain provisions are met; · prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; · authorizing the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote for the directors; · prohibiting shareholder action by written consent unless the written consent is signed by all shareholders entitled to vote on the action; · limiting the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; and · establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings. We cannot assure you that we will pay any dividends. On December 16, 2008, following the consummation of the Arlington transaction, our board of directors adopted a cash dividend policy. The actual declaration of future cash dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, is subject to final determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance. Our ability to pay dividends in any period will depend upon factors including satisfying the requirements under our 2005 Credit Facility and applicable provisions of Marshall Islands law. The timing and amount of dividends, if any, could be affected by factors affecting cash flows, results of operations, required capital expenditures, or reserves. Maintaining the dividend policy will depend on our cash earnings, financial condition and cash requirements and could be affected by factors, including the loss of a vessel, required capital expenditures, reserves established by the board of directors, increased or unanticipated expenses, additional borrowings or future issuances of securities, which may be beyond our control. The declaration and payment of dividends is subject to certain conditions and limitations under our 2005 Credit Facility. Under Marshall Islands law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if it is currently insolvent or would thereby be made insolvent. Marshall Islands law also provides that a company may declare dividends only to the extent of its surplus, or if there is no surplus, out of its net profits for the then current and/or immediately preceding fiscal years. Our dividend policy may be changed at any time, and from time to time, by our board of directors. 40 Future sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The market price of our common stock could decline due to sales of a large number of shares in the market, including sales of shares by our large shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. We have entered into registration rights agreements with the securityholders who received shares for the sale of vessels to Arlington in connection with its initial public offering in November 2004, which were exchanged for shares of our common stock as a result of the Arlington transaction. These registration rights agreements entitle them to have an aggregate of 2,787,772 shares registered for sale in the public market. We have also agreed with Peter C. Georgiopoulos that we will enter into a new registration rights agreement granting Mr. Georgiopoulos registration rights with respect to 2,938,343 shares of our common stock which he received in connection with the Arlington Combination in exchange for shares of General Maritime Subsidiary issued to him in connection with the recapitalization of General Maritime Subsidiary in June 2001 and that such registration rights agreement would become effective within a reasonable time after the effective date of the Arlington Combination. We also registered on Form S-8 an aggregate of 1,624,347 shares issuable upon exercise of options we have granted to purchase common stock or reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans. Our incorporation under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands may limit the ability of our shareholders to protect their interests. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws and by the Republic of the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act. The provisions of the Republic of the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Republic of the Marshall Islands interpreting the Republic of the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act. For example, the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain U.S. jurisdictions. Although the Republic of the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act does specifically incorporate the non-statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction. It may not be possible for our investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us. We are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and most of our subsidiaries are organized in the Republic of Liberia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to serve process within the United States upon us or to enforce judgment upon us for civil liabilities in U.S. courts. In addition, you should not assume that courts in the countries in which we or our subsidiaries are incorporated or where our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries are located (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or our subsidiaries based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or our subsidiaries based upon these laws.
