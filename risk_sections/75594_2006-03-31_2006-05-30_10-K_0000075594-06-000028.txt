ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are certain risks and other factors to be considered when evaluating PacifiCorp. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a discussion of additional important risks and other factors. PacifiCorp is engaged in several large construction or expansion projects, the completion and expected cost of which is subject to significant risk, and PacifiCorp has significant funding needs related to its planned capital expenditures. PacifiCorp is engaged in several large construction or expansion projects, including construction of a new generating facility, the Lake Side Power Plant, in Utah and various capital projects related to transmission and distribution. In addition, in connection with PacifiCorps acquisition by MEHC, MEHC and PacifiCorp have committed to undertake several other capital expenditure projects, principally relating to environmental controls, transmission and distribution, renewable generating and other facilities. PacifiCorp expects to incur substantial construction, expansion and other capital expenditure 15 costs over the next several years, including the recent regulatory commitments previously discussed. PacifiCorp depends upon both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. If these funds are not available and/or if MEHC does not elect to provide any needed funding to PacifiCorp, PacifiCorp may need to postpone or cancel planned capital expenditures. The completion of any or all of PacifiCorps pending, proposed or future construction or expansion projects is subject to substantial risk and may expose PacifiCorp to significant costs. PacifiCorps development or construction efforts on any particular project, or its capital expenditure program generally, may not be successful. If PacifiCorp is unable to complete the development or construction of any capital project, or if it decides to delay or cancel a project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that project. Also, a proposed expansion or new project may cost more than planned to complete, and any excess costs, if related to a regulated asset and found to be imprudent, may not be recoverable in rates. The inability to successfully and timely complete a project or avoid unexpected costs may require PacifiCorp to perform under guarantees, and the inability to avoid unsuccessful projects or to recover any excess costs may materially affect PacifiCorps cash flows and results of operations. PacifiCorp is subject to certain operating uncertainties which may adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The operation of complex electric utility systems (including transmission and distribution) and power generating facilities that are spread over a large geographic area involves many risks associated with operating uncertainties and events beyond PacifiCorps control. These risks include the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission and distribution lines or other equipment or processes, unscheduled plant outages, work stoppages, transmission and distribution system constraints or outages, fuel shortages or interruptions, performance below expected levels of output, capacity or efficiency, the effects of changing government regulation, operator error and catastrophic events such as severe storms, fires, earthquakes, explosions or mining accidents. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. The realization of any of these risks could significantly reduce PacifiCorps revenues or significantly increase its expenses, thereby adversely affecting results of operations. For example, if PacifiCorp cannot operate generation facilities at full capacity due to restrictions imposed by environmental regulations, its revenues could decrease due to decreased wholesale sales and its expenses could increase due to the need to obtain energy from higher-cost sources. Any reduction of revenues or increase in expenses resulting from the risks described above could decrease PacifiCorps cash flows and weaken its financial position. Furthermore, PacifiCorps current and future insurance coverage may not be sufficient to replace lost revenues or cover repair and replacement costs, especially in light of recent catastrophic events affecting the insurance markets that make it more difficult or costly to obtain certain types of insurance. Acts of sabotage and terrorism aimed at PacifiCorps facilities, the facilities of its fuel suppliers or customers, or at regional transmission facilities could adversely affect PacifiCorps business. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically the nations pipeline and electric utility infrastructure, may be the future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected PacifiCorps operations to increased risks. Damage to PacifiCorps assets, the assets of PacifiCorps fuel suppliers or customers, or to regional transmission facilities inflicted by terrorist groups or saboteurs could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant repair costs, force PacifiCorp to increase security measures, cause changes in the insurance markets and cause disruptions of fuel supplies, energy consumption and markets, particularly with respect to natural gas and electric energy. Any of these consequences of acts of terrorism could materially affect PacifiCorps results of operations and cash flows. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also materially adversely affect PacifiCorps ability to raise capital. Recovery of costs by PacifiCorp is subject to regulatory review and approval, and the inability to recover costs may adversely affect PacifiCorps revenues and cash flows. PacifiCorp is subject to the jurisdiction of federal and state regulatory authorities. The FERC establishes tariffs under which PacifiCorp provides transmission service to the wholesale market and the retail market (in states allowing retail competition). The FERC also establishes both cost-based and market-based tariffs under which PacifiCorp sells electricity at wholesale and has licensing authority over most of PacifiCorps hydroelectric generation facilities. In addition, the utility regulatory 16 commissions in each state served by PacifiCorp independently determine the rates that PacifiCorp may charge its retail customers in those states. Each states rate-setting process is based upon the state utility commissions acceptance of an allocated share of PacifiCorps total utility costs for its entire retail service territory. When different states adopt different methods to address this cost allocation issue, some costs may not be incorporated into rates in any state. Rate-making is also generally done on the basis of estimates of normalized costs, so if in a specific year realized costs are higher than normal, rates will not be sufficient to cover those costs. Each state utility commission generally sets rates based on a test year established according to that commissions policies. Certain states use a future test year or allow for escalation of historical costs. In the states in which PacifiCorp operates that use a historical test year, rate adjustments could lag cost increases, or decreases, by up to two years. This regulatory lag causes PacifiCorp to incur costs, including significant new investments, for which recovery through rates is delayed. In addition, each state commission decides what percentage return a utility will be permitted to earn on its equity. Each commission also decides what level of expense and investment is necessary, reasonable and prudent in providing service and may disallow and deny recovery in rates for any costs that do not meet this standard. For these reasons, as well as others (such as recently enacted legislation and the outcome of the recent rate order in Oregon limiting or denying the ability of a utility to recover tax expenses in rates), the rates authorized by the state regulators may not be sufficient to cover costs incurred to provide electrical services in any given period. PacifiCorp is subject to energy regulation, legislation and political risks, and changes in regulations and rates or legislative developments may adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. PacifiCorp is subject to comprehensive governmental regulation, including regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies, which significantly influences PacifiCorps operating environment, the prices it is allowed to charge customers, its capital structure, its costs and its ability to recover costs from customers. These regulatory agencies include the FERC, the EPA, and the public utility commissions in Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. PacifiCorp also conducts its businesses in conformance with a multitude of federal, state and local laws, which are subject to significant changes at any time. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations by any of these regulatory entities, as well as new legislation, could have a material adverse impact on PacifiCorps results of operations. For example, such changes could result in increased retail competition in PacifiCorps service territory, changes to the hydroelectric relicensing process under the Federal Power Act, encouragement of investments in renewable or lower-emission generation, the acquisition by a municipality or other quasi-governmental body of PacifiCorps distribution facilities (by negotiation, legislation or condemnation or by a vote in favor of a Public Utility District under Oregon law), or a negative impact on PacifiCorps current cost recovery arrangements. As another example, PacifiCorp could be adversely affected by Senate Bill 408, which was recently enacted in Oregon. That legislation, and the outcome of a recent rate case, which is currently under formal reconsideration, resulted in a reduction by the OPUC in the rates that PacifiCorp is currently permitted to charge to its Oregon customers, and in the future may limit the ability of PacifiCorp and other public utilities to recover future federal and state income tax expenses in Oregon retail rates. Unless Senate Bill 408 is amended, modified or repealed, or the pending rehearing of the rate case is resolved, in a manner satisfactory to PacifiCorp, such legislation and rules could have a material adverse effect upon PacifiCorps results of operations and cash flows. Several of PacifiCorps hydroelectric projects are in some stage of the FERC relicensing process under the Federal Power Act, as several of PacifiCorps long-term operating licenses have expired or will expire in the next few years. The relicensing process is a political and public regulatory process that involves sensitive resource issues and uncertainties. PacifiCorp cannot predict with certainty the requirements that may be imposed during the relicensing process, the economic impact of those requirements, whether new licenses will ultimately be issued or whether PacifiCorp will be willing to meet the relicensing requirements to continue operating its hydroelectric projects. Loss of hydroelectric resources or additional commitments arising from the relicensing process could increase PacifiCorps operating costs or result in large capital expenditures that reduce earnings and cash flows. In August 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into law. That law potentially impacts many segments of the energy industry. The law directed the FERC to issue new regulations and regulatory decisions in areas such as electric system reliability, electric transmission expansion and pricing, regulation of utility holding companies, and enforcement authority. While the FERC has now issued rules and decisions on multiple aspects of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the full impact of those decisions remains uncertain. As a result of past events affecting electric reliability, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires federal agencies, working together with non-governmental organizations charged with electric reliability responsibilities, to adopt and implement measures designed to ensure the reliability of electric transmission and distribution 17 systems. The implementation of such measures could result in the imposition of more comprehensive or stringent requirements on PacifiCorp or other industry participants, which would result in increased compliance costs and could have a material adverse effect on PacifiCorps business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. PacifiCorp is subject to market risk, counterparty performance risk and other risks associated with wholesale energy markets. In general, market risk is the risk of adverse fluctuations in the market price of wholesale electricity and fuel, including natural gas and coal, which is compounded by energy volume changes affecting the availability of and/or demand for electricity and fuel. PacifiCorp purchases electricity and fuel in the open market or pursuant to short-term or variable-priced contracts as part of its normal operating business. If market prices rise, especially in a time when PacifiCorp requires larger than expected volumes that must be purchased at market or short-term prices, PacifiCorp may have significantly greater costs than anticipated. In addition, it may not be able to timely recover all, if any, of those increased costs through rate-making, due to retroactive rate-making prohibitions, unless deferred accounting or power cost recovery mechanisms have been previously authorized. Likewise, if electricity market prices drop in a period when PacifiCorp is a net seller of electricity in the wholesale market, PacifiCorp will earn less revenue, possibly to the extent of not recovering the cost of generating the electricity. Wholesale electricity prices are influenced primarily by factors throughout the western United States relating to supply and demand. Those factors include the adequacy of generating capacity, scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities, hydroelectric generation levels, prices and availability of fuel sources for generation, disruptions or constraints to transmission facilities, weather conditions, economic growth, and changes in technology. Energy volume changes are caused by unanticipated changes in generation availability and/or changes in customer demand for power due to the weather, the economy and customer behavior. Although PacifiCorp plans for resources to meet its current and expected power delivery obligations, its power costs may be adversely impacted by market risk. PacifiCorp is also exposed to risk related to performance of contractual obligations by its wholesale suppliers and customers. PacifiCorp relies on suppliers to deliver natural gas, coal and electricity in accordance with short- and long-term contracts. Failure or delay by suppliers to provide natural gas, coal or electricity pursuant to existing contracts could disrupt PacifiCorps ability to deliver electricity and require it to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of its customers. In addition, as these contractual agreements end, PacifiCorp may not be able to continue to purchase natural gas, coal or electricity on terms equivalent to the terms of current contractual agreements. PacifiCorp relies on wholesale customers to take delivery of the energy they have committed to purchase and to pay for the energy on a timely basis. Failure of customers to take delivery may require PacifiCorp to find other customers to take the energy at lower prices than the original customers committed to pay. At certain times of year, prices paid by PacifiCorp for energy needed to satisfy its customers demand for power may exceed the amounts PacifiCorp receives through retail rates from these customers. If the strategy PacifiCorp uses to economically hedge the exposure to these risks is ineffective, it could incur significant losses. Weather conditions can adversely affect PacifiCorps operating results. Although PacifiCorps service territory has historically experienced complementary seasonal customer power demand patterns as a result of the geographically diverse area of its operations, weather conditions can significantly affect operating results. For residential customers, within a given year, weather conditions are the dominant cause of usage variations from normal seasonal patterns. For example, in periods of unusually hot summer weather, residential customers tend to use significantly greater amounts of electricity to run air conditioners, which may substantially increase summer peak power demand. Changes in weather conditions and other natural events also impact customer behavior and power demand. Additionally, a portion of PacifiCorps supply of electricity comes from hydroelectric projects that are dependent upon rainfall and snowpack. During or following periods of low rainfall or snowpack, PacifiCorp may obtain substantially less electricity from hydroelectric projects and must purchase greater amounts of electricity from the wholesale market or from other sources at market prices. Accordingly, variations in weather conditions can adversely affect PacifiCorps results of operations through lower revenues and/or increased energy costs. PacifiCorp is subject to environmental, health, safety and other laws and regulations that may adversely impact its business. PacifiCorp is subject to a number of environmental, health, safety and other laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, endangered species, wastewater discharges, solid wastes, hazardous substances and safety matters. PacifiCorp may incur substantial costs and liabilities in connection with its operations as a result of these laws and regulations. In particular, the cost of future compliance with federal, state and local 18 clean air laws, such as those that relate to addressing regional haze issues and those that require certain generators, including some of PacifiCorps electric generating facilities, to limit emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, mercury and other potential pollutants or emissions, may require PacifiCorp to make significant capital expenditures that may not be recoverable through future rates. In addition, these costs and liabilities may include those relating to claims for damages to property and persons resulting from PacifiCorps operations. Regulatory changes, including new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, imposing more comprehensive or stringent requirements on PacifiCorp, to the extent such changes would result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, could have a material adverse effect on PacifiCorps business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, regulatory compliance for existing facilities and the construction of new facilities is a costly and time-consuming process, and intricate and rapidly changing environmental regulations may require major expenditures for permitting and create the risk of expensive delays or material impairment of value if projects cannot function as planned due to changing regulatory requirements or local opposition. In addition to operational standards, environmental laws also impose obligations to clean up or remediate contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, PacifiCorp may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by it, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to its ownership or operation of the property. Given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by PacifiCorp and others at its properties, all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination may not have been identified, even for those properties where an environmental site assessment or other investigation has been conducted. Although PacifiCorp has accrued reserves for its known remediation liabilities, future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to additional remediation liabilities which may be material. Any failure to recover increased environmental, health or safety costs incurred by PacifiCorp may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Poor performance of pension plan investments and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact PacifiCorps liquidity and results of operations. PacifiCorps costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and PacifiCorps required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. While PacifiCorp complies with the minimum funding requirements under federal law, as of March 31, 2006 its projected benefit obligations, which include the impact of expected future compensation increases, exceeded the value of plan assets by approximately $513.6 million, including contributions made between the December 31, 2005 measurement date and March 31, 2006. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of its pension plan assets, and depending upon the other factors described above, PacifiCorp could be required to fund its pension plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, as well as the impact of the other factors described above, could have a material impact on PacifiCorps liquidity by reducing its cash flows and could negatively affect its results of operations. A downgrade in PacifiCorps credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital and its ability to economically hedge in wholesale markets. Changes in PacifiCorps financial performance, capital structure, the regulatory environment in which it operates and other factors expose it to the risk of a credit ratings downgrade by Standard and Poors or Moodys Investor Services, the principal ratings agencies that evaluate PacifiCorps creditworthiness and that of its debt securities and preferred stock. Although PacifiCorp has no rating-downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its outstanding debt. A downgrade in its credit ratings could directly increase the interest rates and commitment fees on its revolving credit agreement. A ratings downgrade also may reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of PacifiCorps commercial paper program, its principal source of short-term borrowing, and may result in the requirement that PacifiCorp post collateral under certain of its power purchase and other agreements. In addition, a credit ratings downgrade could allow counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and energy derivatives markets to require PacifiCorp to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security. These consequences of a credit ratings downgrade could increase PacifiCorps borrowing and operating costs. 19 PacifiCorp has a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect its ability to obtain future financing and limit its expenditures. As of March 31, 2006, PacifiCorp had $4.1 billion in total debt securities outstanding. Its principal financing agreements contain restrictive covenants that limit its ability to borrow funds, and any issuance of debt securities requires prior authorization from multiple state regulatory commissions. PacifiCorp expects that it will need to supplement cash generated from operations and availability under committed credit facilities with new issuances of long-term debt. However, if market conditions are not favorable for the issuance of long-term debt, or if an issuance of long-term debt would exceed contractual or regulatory limits, PacifiCorp may postpone planned capital expenditures, or take other actions, to the extent those expenditures are not fully covered by cash from operations or equity contributions from MEHC and not available under committed credit facilities. MEHC may exercise its significant influence over PacifiCorp in a manner that would benefit MEHC to the detriment of PacifiCorps creditors and preferred stockholders. MEHC, through its subsidiary, owns all of PacifiCorps common stock and therefore has significant influence over its business and any matters submitted for shareholder approval. In circumstances involving a conflict of interest between MEHC and PacifiCorps creditors and preferred stockholders, MEHC could exercise its influence in a manner that would benefit MEHC to the detriment of PacifiCorps creditors and preferred stockholders.
