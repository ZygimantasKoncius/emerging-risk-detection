Item 1A: Risk Factors We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section describes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF PURCHASES MADE BY ANY ONE OF THE COMPANY'S MAJOR CUSTOMERS WOULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. A small number of related customers have historically accounted for a majority of the Company's net revenues in any given fiscal period. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, aggregate sales to our top two Hospitality segment customers, McDonald's and Yum! Brands, amounted to 40%, 41% and 51%, respectively, of total revenues. Most of the Company's customers are not obligated to provide us with any minimum level of future purchases or with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period. In addition, major customers may elect to delay or otherwise change the timing of orders in a manner that could adversely affect the Company's quarterly and annual results of operations. There can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders with us, or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers. AN INABILITY TO PRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS THAT KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF MARKET SHARE. The products we sell are subject to rapid and continual changes in technology. Our competitors offer products that have an increasingly wider range of features and capabilities. We believe that in order to compete effectively we must provide systems incorporating new technologies at competitive prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue funding research and development at levels sufficient to enhance our current product offerings, or that the Company will be able to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the evolving needs of customers. There also can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that will result in delaying or preventing the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products in our existing markets, or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. Likewise, there can be no assurance as to the acceptance of our products in new markets, nor can there be any assurance as to the success of our penetration of these markets, nor to the revenue or profit margins realized by the Company with respect to these products. If any of our competitors were to introduce superior software products at competitive prices, or if our software products no longer met the needs of the marketplace due to technological developments and emerging industry standards, our software products may no longer retain any significant market share. WE GENERATE MUCH OF OUR REVENUE FROM THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AND THEREFORE ARE SUBJECT TO DECREASED REVENUES IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN EITHER IN THAT INDUSTRY OR IN THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we derived 70%, 73% and 71%, respectively, of our total revenues from the Hospitality industry, primarily the quick service restaurant marketplace. Consequently, our Hospitality technology product sales are dependent in large part on the health of the Hospitality industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy, as well as factors such as consumer buying preferences and weather conditions. Instabilities or downturns in the Hospitality market could disproportionately impact our revenues, as clients may either exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. Although we believe we can assist the quick service restaurant sector of the Hospitality industry in a competitive environment, given the cyclical nature of that industry, there can be no assurance that our profitability and growth will continue. WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH CONTAIN PROVISIONS UNIQUE TO PUBLIC SECTOR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THESE CONTRACTS AT ANY TIME. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we derived 30%, 27% and 29%, respectively, of our total revenues from contracts to provide technical services to U.S. Government agencies and defense contractors. Contracts with U.S. Government agencies typically provide that such contracts are terminable at the convenience of the U.S. Government. If the U.S. Government terminated a contract on this basis, we would be entitled to receive payment for our allowable costs and, in general, a proportionate share of our fee or profit for work actually performed. Most U.S. Government contracts are also subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding. As such, we may perform work prior to formal authorization, or the contract prices may be adjusted for changes in scope of work. Termination or modification of a substantial number of our U.S. Government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We perform work for various U.S. Government agencies and departments pursuant to fixed-price, cost-plus fixed fee and time-and-material, prime contracts and subcontracts. Approximately 65% of the revenue that we derived from Government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2006 came from fixed-price or time-and-material contracts. The balance of the revenue that we derived from Government contracts in 2006 primarily came from cost-plus fixed fee contracts. Most of our contracts are for one-year to five-year terms. While fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates we use for calculating the contract price are incorrect, we can incur losses on those contracts. In addition, some of our governmental contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights and, if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then we may not realize their full benefits. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on our financial results. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed fee. However, if our costs under either of these types of contract exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all of our costs. If we are unable to control costs incurred in performing under each type of contract, such inability to control costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Cost over-runs also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards. WE FACE EXTENSIVE COMPETITION IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND OUR FAILURE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY COULD RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS AND/OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. There are several suppliers who offer Hospitality management systems similar to ours. Some of these competitors are larger than PAR and have access to substantially greater financial and other resources and, consequently, may be able to obtain more favorable terms than we can for components and subassemblies incorporated into these Hospitality technology products. The rapid rate of technological change in the Hospitality industry makes it likely that we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. These new products may have features not currently available on our Hospitality products. We believe that our competitive ability depends on our total solution offering, our product development and systems integration capability, our direct sales force and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future. Our Government contracting business has been focused on niche offerings, primarily signal and image processing, information technology outsourcing and engineering services. Many of our competitors are, or are subsidiaries of, companies such as Lockheed-Martin, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, BAE, Harris and SAIC. These companies are larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. We also compete with smaller companies that target particular segments of the Government market. These companies may be better positioned to obtain contracts through competitive proposals. Consequently, there are no assurances that we will continue to win Government contracts as a prime contractor or subcontractor. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE UNIQUE OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT RELATE TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our net revenues from sales outside the United States were 13%, 11% and 9%, respectively, of the Company's total revenues. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of sales. We intend to continue to expand our operations outside the United States and to enter additional international markets, which will require significant management attention and financial resources. Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales, including, but not limited to, regulatory requirements, political and economic changes and disruptions, geopolitical disputes and war, transportation delays, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations, and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates may render our products less competitive relative to local product offerings, or could result in foreign exchange losses, depending upon the currency in which we sell our products. There can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse affect on our future international sales and, consequently, on our operating results. OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES AND, IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE EMPLOYEES, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES TO OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE CUSTOMERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS. We actively compete for qualified professional staff. The availability or lack thereof of qualified professional staff may affect our ability to develop new products and to provide services and meet the needs of our customers in the future. An inability to fulfill customer requirements due to a lack of available qualified staff at agreed upon salary rates may adversely impact our operating results in the future. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS CONSISTS OF GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND A SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT DETERMINATION IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EVEN WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCREASE IN CASH EXPENSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PERIOD. We have goodwill and identifiable intangible assets totaling approximately $25.7 million and $10.7 million at December 31, 2006, respectively, resulting primarily from several business acquisitions. At least annually, we evaluate goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business unit to which these assets relate. This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of such companies decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business unit. These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill and identifiable intangible asset balances that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.
