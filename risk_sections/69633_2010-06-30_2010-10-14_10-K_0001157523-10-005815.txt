ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS. The risks described below are among those that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience and from results predicted by any forward-looking statements related to conditions or events that may occur in the future. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected as a Result of General - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Economic and Market Conditions - ------------------------------ We are subject to the effects of general economic and market conditions. If these conditions deteriorate, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, since October 2008, the U.S. and international economies have experienced a significant downturn and continue to be very volatile. In the event that the downturn in the U.S. or international economies is prolonged or worsens, our revenue levels could be further materially adversely affected in future periods. If the current worldwide economic downturn continues or worsens, many of our current or potential future customers may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result may, modify, delay or cancel purchases of our products. Additionally, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us. Furthermore, the current downturn and market instability makes it difficult for us to forecast our revenues. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected as a Result of the Inability - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- to Maintain Adequate Financing - ------------------------------ Our business is dependent on maintaining the financing used in the Marks acquisition and to fund operations. The current debt facilities provide for certain minimum payments on the Marks term loan and financial covenants relating to ratios affected by profit, asset and debt levels. The Company is not in compliance with several of the covenants in the current facilities. The Company and its banks have been in negotiations to amend and restate the existing terms of the credit facilities and term loan. The Company and its banks have agreed in principle on all the key terms and modifications to the existing revolving credit agreement and term loan. This agreement would include waivers of the existing non-compliance. The restated facilities would provide for restructured covenants that reflect the Company's current financial condition. However, if the Company does not consummate these new facilities or if profits, asset or cash-flow levels decline below the minimums required to meet these covenants or make the minimum debt payments, the debt facilities may be materially adversely affected. Effects on the Company's financing could include higher interest costs, reduction in borrowing availability or revocation of these credit facilities. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected by the Inability to Reduce - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Expenses Relative to the Current Decreases in Sales Levels - ---------------------------------------------------------- While Management has begun implementation of a restructuring plan to reduce expense levels relative to current sales levels, if this plan is delayed, not completed or sales levels decrease further, our business may be adversely affected. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected as a Result of Housing and - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Commercial Building Market Conditions - ------------------------------------- We are subject to the effects of housing and commercial building market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate, resulting in a further decline in new housing or commercial building starts, existing home or commercial building sales or renovations, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected beyond the current levels, particularly in our intrusion and door locking product lines. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected as a Result of Lessening - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Demand in the Security Market - ----------------------------- Our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our products. Continued or worsening delays or reductions in spending, domestically or internationally, for electronic security systems could further materially adversely affect demand for our products, which could result in decreased revenues or earnings. The Markets We Serve Are Highly Competitive and We May Be Unable to Compete - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Effectively - ----------- We compete with approximately 20 other companies that manufacture and market security equipment to distributors, dealers, control stations and original equipment manufacturers. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. The Company competes primarily on the basis of the features, quality, reliability and pricing of, and the incorporation of the latest innovative and technological advances into, its products. The Company also competes by offering technical support services to its customers. In addition, the Company competes on the basis of its expertise, its proven products, its reputation and its ability to provide products to customers on a timely basis. The inability of the Company to compete with respect to any one or more of the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's business. Our Business Could be Materially Adversely Affected as a result of Offering - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Extended Payment Terms to Customers - ----------------------------------- We regularly grant credit terms beyond 30 days to our customers. These terms are offered in an effort to keep a full line of our products in-stock at our customers' locations. The longer terms that are granted, the more risk is inherent in collection of those receivables. We believe that our Bad Debt reserves are adequate to account for this inherent risk. Competitors May Develop New Technologies or Products in Advance of Us - --------------------------------------------------------------------- Our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products and services by our competitors, and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors. There can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products that are superior to the Company's products. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience additional price competition, and that such competition may not adversely affect the Company's position and results of operations. The Company's Products are Subject to Technological Changes from Time to Time, - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Which may Result in Increased Research and Developments Expenditures to Attract - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- or Retain Customers - ------------------- The industry in which the Company operates is characterized by constantly improved products. Future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and market products and product enhancements cost-effectively, which will require continued expenditures for product engineering, sales and marketing. The Company's research and development expenditures, which were $4,922,000 and $5,116,000 for 2010 and 2009, respectively, are principally targeted at enhancing existing products, and to a lesser extent at developing new ones. If the Company cannot modify its products to meet its customers' changing needs, we may lose sales. We Rely On Distributors To Sell Our Products And Any Adverse Change In Our - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Relationship With Our Distributors Could Result In A Loss Of Revenue And Harm - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our Business. - ------------- We distribute our products primarily through independent distributors and wholesalers of security alarm and security hardware equipment. Our distributors and wholesalers also sell our competitors' products, and if they favor our competitors' products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. In addition, the financial health of these distributors and wholesalers and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors and wholesalers may be unable to withstand adverse changes in business conditions. Our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors and wholesalers substantially weakens. Members of Management and Certain Directors Beneficially Own a Substantial - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Portion of the Company's Common Stock and May Be in a Position to Determine the - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Outcome of Corporate Elections - ------------------------------ Richard L. Soloway, our Chief Executive Officer, members of management and the Board of Directors beneficially own 31.4% of the currently outstanding shares of Common Stock. By virtue of such ownership and their positions with Napco, they may have the practical ability to determine the election of all directors and control the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to Napco's stockholders. In addition, Napco has a staggered Board of Directors. Such concentration of ownership and the staggered Board could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of Napco. We Are Dependent Upon the Efforts of Richard L. Soloway, Our Chief Executive - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Officer - ------- The success of the Company is largely dependent on the efforts of Richard L. Soloway, Chief Executive Officer. The loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and prospects. There is currently no succession plan. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected by an Increase in the - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exchange Rate of the Dominican Peso - ----------------------------------- We are exposed to foreign currency risks due to our significant operations in the Dominican Republic. We have significant operations in the Dominican Republic which are denominated in Dominican pesos. We are subject to the risk that currency exchange rates between the United States and the Dominican Republic will fluctuate, potentially resulting in an increase in some of our expenses when US dollars are transferred to Dominican pesos to pay these expenses. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected by the Integration of Marks - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- into Our Existing Operations - ---------------------------- Our business is dependent on the orderly, effective integration of the acquired Marks business, technologies, product lines and employees into our organization. If this integration is unsuccessful, our business may be materially adversely affected. The Company's Debt Repayments Relating to the Acquisition of Marks Require - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Substantially Higher Cashflows - ------------------------------ The Marks acquisition requires quarterly principal debt repayments of approximately $893,000, plus interest, that are in addition to the Company's historical cash-flow requirements. A significant decline in the Company's earnings or cashflows could put at risk the Company's ability to repay this debt as well as to failing to meet certain financial covenants within the existing Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Loan.
