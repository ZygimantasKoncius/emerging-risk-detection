Risk Factors The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business including its financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns. Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. Economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers. We continue to take steps to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements. Significant declines in the automotive industry and financial declines and restructurings by our significant customers may make it necessary to take restructuring actions and charges. We are dependent on market segments that use our key products. Decreased demand in those segments could adversely affect our business. Some of our products, in particular turbochargers, are currently used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Any significant reduction in production in these market segments or loss of business in these market segments could have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers. We face strong competition. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically 13 Table of Contents integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional U.S. original equipment manufacturer customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our businesses. We are under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce the prices of our products. There is substantial and continuing pressure on original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. Although original equipment manufacturers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major original equipment manufacturer customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These original equipment manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. We believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to original equipment manufacturers or that the trend by original equipment manufacturers towards outsourcing will continue. Annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our original equipment manufacturer customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. We cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits. We are sensitive to the effects of our major customers labor relations. All three of our primary North American customers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Because of domestic original equipment manufacturers dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original equipment manufacturers facilities. Similarly, a majority of our global customers operations outside of North America are also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business. Part of our labor force is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 23% of our U.S. workforce was unionized. Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. This agreement expires in September 2012. The hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized. While we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business. We are subject to extensive environmental regulations. Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our business, operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental, health and safety laws. However, the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur 14 Table of Contents material costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future. We have contingent liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other claims. We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a result, as of December 31, 2010, we may be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 38 of these sites. We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. Managements estimate of the loss range for environmental liability, including conditional asset retirement obligations, for 2010 is between approximately $27 million and $42 million. We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. Based on information available to us, we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities of $29.2 million, which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410 of $1.2 million at December 31, 2010. We currently expect the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the next three to five years. We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products. Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement. Based upon information available to us, we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of $66.8 million at December 31, 2010. We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party to, various legal proceedings, including those described in Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers, intellectual property matters and employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate. Our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful. We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers; (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete; (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components; and (d) the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively. We are subject to risks related to our international operations. We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide. For 2010, 15 Table of Contents approximately 74% of our sales were outside North America. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, social unrest, political instability and disputes, and international terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive. See Note 19, Reporting Segments and Related Information to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, regarding the size of our international operations. We may not realize sales represented by awarded business. We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. If actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments, it could adversely affect our business. We are impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits. The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits. To partially address this impact, we continue to make adjustments to certain retiree medical and pension plans. See Note 11, Retirement Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently underfunded. We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect. See Note 11, Retirement Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business. Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance. Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain, negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our business. We rely on sales to major customers. We rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the world. Supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the Company in working capital, plant and equipment. Some of our customers are rated by the credit rating agencies as below investment grade. The loss of sales to a major customer, due to any of a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, the customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide sales in 2010 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately 19% and 11%, respectively, of our 2010 consolidated sales. Suppliers economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business. Rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw material, commodity, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and others could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply 16 Table of Contents interruption risks. In certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. While we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors, we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business. We continue to face highly volatile commodity costs used in the production of our products. The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel, nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings, and bar stock. Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results. We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible or by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any materials increases. The discontinuation of ability to pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely affect our business. From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers. We could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers. In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations. However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, Acts of God, or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. This would adversely affect our customer relations and business. A downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets. Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted. Additionally, our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. The interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement. Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing. Conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business. Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. Original equipment manufacturers have experienced difficulties from a weakened economy and tightened credit markets. If our customers reduce their orders to us, it would adversely affect our results of operations. A prolonged downturn in the automotive industry or a significant product mix shift due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or incur impairment charges. Continued uncertainty relating to the financial condition of automakers may adversely affect our business. 17 Table of Contents We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties. The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. The Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts. We are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers. The Company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers compensation claims, health care benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services. These service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the Companys business. Insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business. Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide. Any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business. We are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems. To improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll and general management operations. If the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business. A variety of other factors could adversely affect our business. Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start  up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs, underutilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; and global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments The Company has received no written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2010 fiscal year that remain unresolved. 18 Table of Contents
