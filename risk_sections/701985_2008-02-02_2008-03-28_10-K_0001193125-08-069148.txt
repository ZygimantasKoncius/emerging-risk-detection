ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in Item 1. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not our only risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. Our revenue and profit results are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. Our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. Purchases of womens intimate apparel, apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. In such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect our profitability. Our net sales depend on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space. Many of our stores are located in shopping malls. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those malls. Our stores benefit from the ability of the malls anchor tenants, generally large department stores, and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. Sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from non-mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores. In addition, a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment in a particular mall, or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target consumers, would adversely affect our business. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. Our net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. We experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 5 Table of Contents Seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. If we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability. Our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. Our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. Accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. There can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. Our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our growth. We intend to further expand into international markets. The risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners for our international expansion. Further, entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. We cannot ensure the profitability of our expansion into international markets. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. We have global representation through independently owned La Senza stores operating under license agreements. Although we have criteria to evaluate and screen prospective licensees, the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully. Our direct channel business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations. Our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results. Risks include, but are not limited to the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and re-selling it overseas outside our control and (d) risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Any of these events could adversely affect our business. In August 2007, we opened a new distribution center for our Victorias Secret Direct business that includes new systems, material handling equipment and processes. The ramp-up of the new distribution center to full capacity has been very challenging and has resulted in significant delays in shipping and incurrence of additional costs. We expect to continue to incur additional costs into 2008 as a result of these operational challenges. 6 Table of Contents Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our brand images. Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. Our failure to adequately protect our trade names and trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. We believe that our trade names and trademarks are an essential element of our strategy. We have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names and trademarks and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries in which our manufacturers are located. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. If any third party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand images could be materially adversely affected. Our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions. Market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets. The receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses. Our stock price may be volatile. Our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of our quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of other companies in the retail industry or the markets we serve. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital. The credit ratings agencies have periodically reviewed our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be unable to service our debt. We may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur. Additionally, some of our debt related agreements require maintenance of certain financial ratios which limit the total amount we may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets. Our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. The sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. We compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores 7 Table of Contents and discount retailers. In addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through e-commerce and catalogues. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. In many cases, our competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. Increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact our results. Our success depends in part on managements ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. In response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions. We may be unable to retain key personnel. It is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including Leslie H. Wexner (Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer). The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. We may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs. We believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. Delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries. We purchase intimate apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. We do not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts. Many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. We compete with other companies for production facilities. 8 Table of Contents We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:  political instability;  imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;  legal and regulatory matters;  currency and exchange risks;  local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity;  potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts;  disruption of imports by labor disputes; and  changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation. New initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries. In addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. Our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk. Our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. We purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. Similar to most other specialty retailers, we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory. Factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. Prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers. A continual rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. We rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. Future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. 9 Table of Contents We significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems. Our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. Our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, controls and reporting. In addition, we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise, sourcing, distribution, e-commerce and support systems, including finance. Modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. The launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2005. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. As a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE). Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. ITEM 1B.
