ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. A SUBSTANTIAL OR EXTENDED DECLINE IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: - changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas; - the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC; - the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; - political conditions, including embargoes, in or affecting other oil-producing activity; - the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity; - the level of global oil and natural gas inventories; - weather conditions; - technological advances affecting energy consumption; and - the price and availability of alternative fuels. Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Lower prices will also negatively impact the value of our proved reserves. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. 10 A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF OUR PROPERTIES ARE UNDEVELOPED; THEREFORE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SUCCESS IS GREATER THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IF THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROPERTIES WERE CATEGORIZED AS PROVED DEVELOPED PRODUCING. Because a substantial percentage of our properties are unproven or proved undeveloped, we will require significant additional capital to prove and develop such properties before they may become productive. Further, because of the inherent uncertainties associated with drilling for oil and gas, some of these properties may never be developed to the extent that they result in positive cash flow. Even if we are successful in our development efforts, it could take several years for a significant portion of our undeveloped properties to be converted to positive cash flow. While our current business plan is to fund the development costs with funds on hand and cash flow from our other producing properties, if such funds are not sufficient we may be forced to seek alternative sources for cash, through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, increased borrowings or other means. DRILLING FOR AND PRODUCING OIL AND NATURAL GAS ARE HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES WITH MANY UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our future success will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Please read "-Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate" (below) for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following: - delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; - pressure or irregularities in geological formations; - shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel; - equipment failures or accidents; - adverse weather conditions; - reductions in oil and natural gas prices; - title problems; and - limitations in the market for oil and natural gas. IF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES DECREASE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE WRITE-DOWNS OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF OUR OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, POTENTIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE TRADING VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES. Accounting rules require that we review periodically the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. A write-down could constitute a non-cash charge to earnings. It is likely the cumulative effect of a write-down could also negatively impact the trading price of our securities. RESERVE ESTIMATES DEPEND ON MANY ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY TURN OUT TO BE INACCURATE. ANY MATERIAL INACCURACIES IN THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES OR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT THE QUANTITIES AND PRESENT VALUE OF OUR RESERVES. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. In order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as 11 oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves, as reported from time to time, is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. If future values decline or costs increase it could negatively impact our ability to finance operations, and individual properties could cease being commercially viable, affecting our decision to continue operations on producing properties or to attempt to develop properties. All of these factors would have a negative impact on earnings and net income, and most likely the trading price of our securities. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THIRD PARTY OPERATORS OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. Under the terms of the Operating Agreements related to our oil and gas properties, third parties act as the operator of our oil and gas wells and control the drilling activities to be conducted on our properties. Therefore, we have limited control over certain decisions related to activities on our properties, which could affect our results of operations. Decisions over which we have limited control include: - the timing and amount of capital expenditures; - the timing of initiating the drilling and recompleting of wells; - the extent of operating costs; and - the level of ongoing production. PROSPECTS THAT WE DECIDE TO DRILL MAY NOT YIELD OIL OR NATURAL GAS IN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE QUANTITIES. Our prospects are properties on which we have identified what we believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. This risk may be enhanced in our situation, due to the fact that a significant percentage of our reserves are currently unproved reserves. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES AND BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF OUR OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS. We are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of: - environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination; - abnormally pressured formations; - mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse; - fires and explosions; - personal injuries and death; and - natural disasters. 12 Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to our company. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then it could adversely affect us. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT THE COST, MANNER OR FEASIBILITY OF DOING BUSINESS. Exploration, development, production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include: - discharge permits for drilling operations; - drilling bonds; - reports concerning operations; - the spacing of wells; - unitization and pooling of properties; and - taxation. Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. OUR OPERATIONS MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES TO COMPLY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations or the imposition of injunctive relief. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition as well as the industry in general. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or if our operations were standard in the industry at the time they were performed. OUR OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATING TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. We currently have interests in multiple oil and gas concessions in Colombia and anticipate that operations in Colombia will constitute a substantial element of our strategy going forward. The political climate in Colombia is unstable and could be subject to radical change over a very short period of time. In the event of a significant negative change in the political or economic climate in Colombia, we may be forced to abandon or suspend our operations in Colombia. OUR OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA ARE CONTROLLED BY HUPECOL WHICH MAY CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING OUR COLOMBIAN ASSETS AND OPERATIONS WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. We are an investor in Hupecol and our interest in the assets and operations of Hupecol represent all of our assets and operations in Colombia and are our principal assets and operations. On July 17, 2007, Hupecol advised us that it had retained an investment bank for purposes of evaluating a possible transaction involving monetization of Hupecol's assets. In March 2008, Hupecol Caracara LLC, as owner/operator of the Caracara Association Contract, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell all of its interest in the Caracara prospect. If that transaction is completed, we will receive our proportionate interest in the net sale proceeds and will relinquish 13 all of our interest in the Caracara prospect. There is no assurance as to when, or if, the planned sale of the Caracara prospect will be completed. If the planned sale is completed there is no assurance that we will be able to reinvest the proceeds received in a manner that will adequately replace the revenues generated by, and the reserves attributable to, the Caracara prospect. Further, it is possible that Hupecol will carry out similar sales in the future. Our management intends to closely monitor the nature and progress of future transactions by Hupecol in order to protect our interests. However, we have no effective ability to alter or prevent a transaction and are unable to predict whether or not any such transactions will in fact occur or the nature or timing of any such transaction. UNLESS WE REPLACE OUR OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES, OUR RESERVES AND PRODUCTION WILL DECLINE, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS AND INCOME. Unless we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and, therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. If we are unable to develop, exploit, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and income will decline as production declines, until our existing properties would be incapable of sustaining commercial production. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF ANY OF WHOM COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. Our success will depend on our ability to retain John F. Terwilliger, our principal executive officer, and to attract other experienced management and non-management employees, including engineers, geoscientists and other technical and professional staff. We will depend, to a large extent, on the efforts, technical expertise and continued employment of such personnel and members of our management team. If members of our management team should resign or we are unable to attract the necessary personnel, our business operations could be adversely affected. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR HIGH COST OF DRILLING RIGS, EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, PERSONNEL AND OIL FIELD SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE ON A TIMELY BASIS OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS WITHIN OUR BUDGET. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations. As the price of oil and natural gas increases, the demand for production equipment and personnel will likely also increase, potentially resulting, at least in the near-term, in shortages of equipment and personnel. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by virtue of offering drilling companies more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, not only would this potentially delay our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow, but could also significantly increase the cost of producing those reserves, thereby negatively impacting anticipated net income. ( IF OUR ACCESS TO MARKETS IS RESTRICTED, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PRODUCTION, OUR INCOME AND ULTIMATELY OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN OUR LEASES. Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may operate in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil or natural gas have several adverse affects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production. 14 WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS AND FUTURE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. While we presently believe that our operating cash flows and funds on hand will support our ongoing operations and anticipated future capital requirements, a number of factors could result in our needing additional financing, including reductions in oil and natural gas prices, declines in production, unexpected developments in operations that could decrease our revenues, increase our costs or require additional capital contributions and commitments to new acquisition or drilling programs. We have no commitments to provide any additional financing, if needed, and may be limited in our ability to obtain the capital necessary to support operations, complete development, exploitation and exploration programs or carry out new acquisition or drilling programs. We have not thoroughly investigated whether this capital would be available, who would provide it, and on what terms. If we are unable, on acceptable terms, to raise the required capital, our business may be seriously harmed or even terminated. COMPETITION IN THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY IS INTENSE, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital. THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THIS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO RESELL COMMON STOCK WHEN YOU WANT OR AT PRICES YOU FIND ATTRACTIVE. The price of our common stock constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. Our stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: - quarterly variations in our operating results; - operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; - changes in expectations as to our future financial performance; - announcements by us, our partners or our competitors of leasing and drilling activities; - the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us; - future sales of our equity or equity-related securities; - changes in general conditions in our industry and in the economy, the financial markets and the domestic or international political situation; - fluctuations in oil and gas prices; - departures of key personnel; and - regulatory considerations. In addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the 15 availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the trading price of our common stock. OUR CHARTER AND BYLAWS, AS WELL AS PROVISIONS OF DELAWARE LAW, COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE OUR COMPANY AND ALSO COULD LIMIT THE PRICE THAT INVESTORS ARE WILLING TO PAY IN THE FUTURE FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Delaware corporate law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions without the concurrence of our management or board of directors. These provisions: - authorize our board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors, without stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock; - provide for a staggered board of directors and three-year terms for directors, so that no more than one-third of our directors could be replaced at any annual meeting; - provide that directors may be removed only for cause; and - establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could also delay or prevent a change of control. Taken together, these provisions of our charter and bylaws, Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices of our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. OUR MANAGEMENT OWNS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK, GIVING THEM INFLUENCE OR CONTROL IN CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS, AND THEIR INTERESTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER SHAREHOLDERS. At March 1, 2008, our directors and executive officers owned approximately 46.5 percent of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our current directors and executive officer are in a position to significantly influence or control the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the adoption of any amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. Such level of control of the company may delay or prevent a change of control on terms favorable to the other shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other shareholders.
