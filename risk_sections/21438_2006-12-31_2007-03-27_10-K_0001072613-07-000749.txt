Item 1A. Risk Factors - ---------------------- The Company operates in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that the Company cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" discussion in Item 7 highlights some of these risks. IF THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES, IT MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. The Company has incurred losses in each of its five most recent fiscal years. If the Company continues to incur operating losses and fails to become a profitable company, it may be unable to continue its operations. The extent of the Company's future losses and the timing of its potential profitability are highly uncertain. The Company's future growth and profitability depends on its ability to successfully market the VSR1000 product. We must continue to enhance the features and functionality of our products to meet customer requirements and competitive demands. In addition, the failure of these planned product enhancements to operate as expected could delay or prevent future sales of our products. If our target customers do not adopt, purchase and successfully deploy our products and our planned product enhancements, our revenues could be adversely impacted. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. The Company's revenues in any particular period may be lower than revenues in a preceding or comparable period. Factors contributing to fluctuations, some of which are beyond our control, include: o fluctuations in our customers' businesses; o our customers' budgets and the related procurement cycles; o timing and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by us or our competitors; o availability of components from our suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of our subcontractors; o timing and level of expenditures for sales, marketing and product development; o changes in the prices of our products or of our competitors' products; and o general industry trends. In addition, the Company has historically operated with no significant backlog. Any significant deferral of orders for its products would cause a shortfall in revenues for the quarter. The Company may receive one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the Company's revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If the Company's quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market, our stock price could be adversely impacted. 7 THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS. The Company may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to fund operations. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $2.8 million in cash and cash equivalents to fund its operations and continue its product development. Although the Company raised an additional $1.5 million through debt financing in January 2007, if operations do not become profitable, it will need to raise additional capital in order to have sufficient capital to fund its operations beyond 2007. The Company may not get funding when it needs it or on favorable terms. In addition, the amount of capital that a company such as ThinkEngine is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond its control, such as the share price of its stock and its trading volume. As a result, the Company may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to it, or at all. If the Company is able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet its future needs and may be highly dilutive. If the Company cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy its capital requirements, it may have to delay, scale-back or eliminate operations. A SMALL NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS REVENUES, AND MOST OF ITS RECEIVABLES. THE LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER OR REDUCED SPENDING OF THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COMPANY'S REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW. A few large telecommunications, audio conferencing and cable service providers account for a substantial portion of the Company's revenues. These industries have recently experienced significant consolidation due to mergers and acquisitions. As service providers increase in size, it is possible that an even greater percentage of the Company's revenues will be attributable to a smaller number of large service providers going forward. THE COMPANY'S RECENT ACQUISITION HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES. In November 2005, the Company, as the former Cognitronics Corporation, acquired ThinkEngine Networks, Inc. which in 2006 was renamed TE Networks, Inc. ("TE Networks"). The operations of TE Networks have never made a profit and will continue to generate losses and require funding until sales of the VSR1000 product can be increased to sufficient levels, of which there can be no assurance. In January 2007, the TE Networks, Inc. subsidiary was merged into the Company and ceased to exist as a separate entity. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES WITH MANY PARTICIPANTS. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. Competition for next generation service providers as well as for new infrastructure deployments is particularly intense. The Company has a number of existing competitors, some of which are very large, with significantly greater technological and financial resources, brand recognition, and established relationships with telecommunications service providers. In addition, new competitors may enter the industry as a result of shifts in technology. The Company does not offer any assurances that it will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. TECHNOLOGY DRIVES THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN ITS INDUSTRY, OR IF IT PURSUES TECHNOLOGIES THAT DO NOT BECOME COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTED, CUSTOMERS MAY NOT BUY ITS PRODUCTS OR USE ITS SERVICES. The telecommunications and cable industries use numerous and varied technologies and large service providers often invest in several and, sometimes, incompatible technologies. The industry also demands frequent and, at times, significant technology upgrades. The Company does not have the resources to invest in all of these existing and potential technologies. As a result, the Company concentrates its resources on those technologies it believes have or will achieve substantial customer acceptance and in which it has appropriate technical expertise. However, existing products often have short product life cycles. In addition, the Company's choices for developing technologies may prove incorrect if customers do not adopt the products it develops or if those technologies ultimately prove to be unviable. The Company's operating results depend to a significant extent on the market acceptance of its products and its ability to enhance its existing products, to continue to introduce new products successfully and on a timely basis, and to develop new or enhance existing tools for its services offerings. 8 THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. The Company's future success is dependent on its ability to attract and retain engineering, sales and executive personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel, and the Company may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development and introduction of new products or to replace qualified personnel that may leave its employ. Part of our compensation program includes stock options. If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET FLUCTUATES AND IS IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DECISIONS BY SERVICE PROVIDERS REGARDING THEIR DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR TIMING OF PURCHASES, AS WELL AS DEMAND AND SPENDING FOR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. Although the Company believes the overall market will continue to grow, the rate of growth could vary geographically and across different technologies, and is subject to substantial fluctuations. The specific market segments in which the Company participates may not experience the growth of other segments. As a result, our revenues are difficult to forecast and our quarterly operating results can fluctuate significantly. THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION AND INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH COULD CAUSE IT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES OR PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM SELLING ITS PRODUCTS. Intellectual property litigation can be costly and time-consuming and can divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. A successful claim by a third party of patent or other intellectual property infringement by the Company could compel it to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or force it to pay significant damages and could even require it to stop selling certain products. IF THE COMPANY'S AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS. Under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company's intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the Company's amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. The Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S REPORTED EARNINGS AND OPERATING INCOME. U. S. generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of the Company's business, such as revenue recognition for software, accounting for investments, and treatment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in the Company's products or business could significantly change the Company's reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of this report. ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. The Company may make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures as part of its long-term business strategy. Any such transaction involves significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance the Company's business strategy, that the company doesn't realize a satisfactory return on the investment it makes, or that the Company may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management's attention from its other business activities. These factors could adversely affect the Company's operating results or financial condition. 9 THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS TO PRODUCE SUBASSEMBLIES AND CERTAIN FINISHED PRODUCTS. The Company has outsourced the production of certain subassemblies and finished goods. If a contract manufacturer terminates its relationship with the Company or is unable to fill its orders on a timely basis, or if the Company does not accurately forecast its requirements, the Company may be unable to deliver the affected products to meet its customers' orders, which may adversely impact our revenue and operating results in a quarter.
