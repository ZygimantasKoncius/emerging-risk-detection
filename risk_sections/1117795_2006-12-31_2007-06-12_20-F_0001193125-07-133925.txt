Risk Factors  Fluctuations in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our financial results and Item 10. Additional Information  Exchange Controls. Each of our operating subsidiaries in Mainland China is able to purchase foreign exchange for settlement of current account transactions, as defined in applicable regulations, in order to satisfy its foreign exchange requirements. U.S. GAAP Reconciliation Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. The following table sets forth a comparison of our profit attributable to equity shareholders and shareholders equity in accordance with Hong Kong GAAP and U.S. GAAP. As of or for the year endedDecember 31 2004 2005 2006 (in millions of RMB) Profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders in accordance with: Hong Kong GAAP 41,749 53,549 66,026 U.S. GAAP 45,061 54,504 65,074 Shareholders equity in accordance with: Hong Kong GAAP 233,161 272,824 319,002 U.S. GAAP 198,119 237,252 282,690 Under Hong Kong GAAP, we adopted the purchase accounting method to account for our acquisitions of the eight regional mobile telecommunications companies in July 2002, our acquisition of the ten regional mobile telecommunications companies and other telecommunications assets in July 2004 and our acquisition of Peoples in 2006. Under the purchase accounting method, the acquired results of these companies were included in the results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. Goodwill is the excess of the cost over the fair value of our share of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. In prior years, goodwill arising on the date of our acquisition of the eight regional mobile telecommunications companies in July 2002 and our acquisition of the ten 47 Table of Contents regional mobile telecommunications companies and other telecommunications assets in July 2004 is amortized to the consolidated statements of income on a straight line of twenty years. Effective January 1, 2005, we no longer amortize goodwill due to the adoption of HKFRS 3. See Special Note on Our Financial Information and Certain Statistical Information Presented in This Annual Report. Under U.S. GAAP, because we and the companies acquired from our immediate holding company were deemed to be under common control prior to the acquisitions, the acquisitions were considered a combination of entities under common control. Under U.S. GAAP, combinations of entities under common control are accounted for under the as if pooling-of-interests method, whereby assets and liabilities are accounted for at historical cost and our consolidated financial statements are adjusted retrospectively to include the financial statements of these previously separate companies for all periods presented. The consideration we paid or payable in each acquisition was treated as an equity transaction in the respective years of each acquisition, and goodwill amortization recognized under Hong Kong GAAP in 2004 was reversed for U.S. GAAP purposes. In addition, there are other differences between Hong Kong GAAP and U.S. GAAP for the periods presented, which relate primarily to:  the computation of capitalized interest;  the revaluation of property, plant and equipment and land lease prepayments of the acquired companies under Hong Kong GAAP;  the recognition of deferred income taxes;  the non-recognition under Hong Kong GAAP of certain of our employee housing scheme costs;  the treatment of share options we grant to directors and employees;  the recognition as revenue of connection fees and telephone number selection fees; and  the net savings arising from interconnection, roaming and leased line agreements. Disclosure relating to these differences can be found in note 40 to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 and our condensed consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 prepared and presented under U.S. GAAP have been included in note 40 to our consolidated financial statements to reflect the impact of the significant differences between Hong Kong GAAP and U.S. GAAP.

Compensation The aggregate amount of compensation that we paid to our directors and executive officers in 2006 for services performed as directors, officers or employees was approximately HK$63 million (US$8.2 million). We adopted a share option scheme on October 8, 1997, or the Old Scheme, pursuant to which our directors may, at their discretion, invite our employees, including executive directors, or employees of our subsidiaries, to take up options to subscribe for ordinary shares up to a maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares equal to 10% of our total issued share capital. Pursuant to a resolution passed at the annual general meeting held on June 24, 2002, the Old Scheme was terminated and a new share option scheme, or the Current Scheme, was adopted. The purpose of the Current Scheme is to provide the Company with a flexible and effective means of remunerating and providing benefits to the employees, the executive directors and the non-executive directors of the Company, any of its holdings companies and their respective subsidiaries and any entity in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries holds any equity interest, thereby providing incentives to these participants. Under the Current Scheme, the directors of the Company may, at their discretion, invite the plan participants to take up options to subscribe for the ordinary shares of the Company. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which can be subscribed pursuant to options that are or may be granted under the above schemes equals to 10% of the total issued share capital of the Company as at the date of adoption of the Current Scheme. Options lapsed or cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Old Scheme or the Current Scheme will not be counted for the purpose of calculating this 10% limit. As the Old Scheme was terminated with effect on June 24, 2002, no further options were granted under the Old Scheme thereafter. As at December 31, 2006, the total number of ordinary shares which may be issued on the exercise of the outstanding options granted under the Old Scheme is 14,401,300. As at the same date, the total number of ordinary shares which may be issued on the exercise of the outstanding options granted or to be granted under the Current Scheme is 1,559,974,404. No share options were granted under the Current Scheme during the year ended December 31, 2006. The consideration payable for the grant of option under each of the Old Scheme and the Current Scheme is HK$1.00. For options granted before September 1, 2001 under the Old Scheme, the exercise price of the options was determined by the directors of the Company at their discretion provided that such price may not be set below a minimum price which is the higher of: (i) the nominal value of a share; and 51 Table of Contents (ii) 80% of the average of the closing price of the ordinary share on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the option was granted. For options granted under the Current Scheme, the exercise price of the options are determined by the directors of the Company at their discretion provided that such price may not be set below a minimum price which is the highest of: (i) the nominal value of an ordinary share; (ii) the closing price of the ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the date on which the option was granted; and (iii) the average closing price of the ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the option was granted. Under both the Old Scheme and the Current Scheme, the term of the option is determined by the directors at their discretion, provided that all options shall be exercised within 10 years after the adoption of the scheme (in the case of the Old Scheme) and within 10 years after the date on which the option is granted (in the case of the Current Scheme). As of December 31, 2006, the directors and employees of the Company had options to subscribe for the ordinary shares of the Company granted under both the Old Scheme and, from June 24, 2002 onwards, the Current Scheme. In 2006, 132,654,741 of these options had been exercised. See  Share Ownership below for details on options granted to our directors.

As a result, our corporate governance practices differ in some respects from those required to be followed by U.S. companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Employees See 
