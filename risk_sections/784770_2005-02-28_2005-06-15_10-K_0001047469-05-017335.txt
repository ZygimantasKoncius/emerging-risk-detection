RISK FACTORS Cautionary Statements Statements in this Report that are not historical facts, including all statements about our business strategy or expectations, or information about new and existing products and technologies or market characteristics and conditions, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the factors described below which could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Potential Future Insufficiency of Capital and Financial Resources We require additional financing to meet our ongoing obligations plans through to the end of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2006. Despite intending to obtain it when needed, it may be unavailable when our liquid resources are at an end. Once we obtain financing, terms of the financing itself could have material adverse effects on the market price of the common stock. Problems that we could encounter because of insufficient capital are numerous, but include additional costs and expenses. Some additional costs might be associated with complying with or defending legal actions by or for creditors, or paying fees, charges or costs of creditors. Other costs may include relative inefficiencies or loss of productivity, which may be reflected in the financial results. We could lose lenders, suppliers, vendors, key employees and service providers due to concerns about the Company's liquidity. Many costs and fees could become higher as the Company loses liquidity, and this could accelerate the Company's cash consumption rate. The combined effect of these problems could lead the Company to have to cease operations and/or file for bankruptcy protection. Pending Agreement and Plan of Reorganization Our plans for future financing and growth center around a transaction with QuaTech, Inc. We are committed to the transaction, subject to certain conditions, pursuant to a binding written agreement. Although no assurance exists that we will complete the acquisition, we are continuing to incur substantial costs to attempt to complete the transaction, including but not limited to transaction costs. Should the transaction be terminated, there are additional expenses and costs that we would also incur. We plan to file a registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the QuaTech, Inc. transaction and to combine that registration statement with our proxy statement for our annual shareholders' meeting, which will among other things be held to consider whether to approve the transaction, which involves approving the issuance of shares of our authorized and unissued common stock for all the shares of QuaTech, Inc. and approving more shares, if necessary, for additional financing as described in the proxy statement. Proposed Reclassification Our plans include proposing to our shareholders certain actions, including our proposal to authorize a reverse stock split, in order to achieve compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. A reverse stock split will reduce the reported daily trading volume (in terms of number of shares) of our common stock in proportion to the split ratio. A reverse stock split also will increase substantially the amount of shares of our common stock that are authorized and unissued, making additional shares available for future issuance by our Board of Directors without future stockholder vote. The number of shares of authorized Common Stock (currently 40 million) will not change but the number of shares issued and outstanding (currently million) will be reduced in proportion to the reverse split ratio. Further, no assurance is intended that a reverse stock split will necessarily result in a full proportionate increase in the market price per share of reclassified common stock, and in fact there are numerous examples of reverse splits by other companies failing to maintain a full proportionate increase in the market price per share of the common stock. 33 Product Development and Technological Change The wireless and memory module industries are characterized by rapid technological change and are highly competitive with respect to timely product innovation. Our memory and wireless products are subject to obsolescence or price erosion because competitors are continuously introducing technologies with the same or greater capacity as our technology. As a result, wireless products may have a product life of not more than one to three years. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new wireless products and product enhancements to keep up with technological advances and to meet customer needs. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements, or any significant delays in product development, firmware or software development, or introduction of wireless technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the Company could incur additional operating costs with the introduction of new products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in planned product development or marketing efforts, or that we will have adequate financial or technical resources for planned product development and promotion. Uncertainty of Market Acceptance or Profitability of New Products The introduction of new products, such as our product for the wireless marketplace, could require the expenditure of an unknown amount of funds for research and development, tooling, software development, manufacturing processes, inventory and marketing. In order to successfully develop products, we will need to successfully anticipate market needs and may need to overcome rapid technological change and competition. In order to achieve high volume production, we will need to out-source production to third parties or enter into licensing arrangements and be successful in the management of sub-contractors overseas. We are inexperienced in the wireless industry, and our plans in that industry are unproven. We have limited marketing capabilities and resources and are dependent upon internal sales and marketing personnel and a network of independent sales representatives for the marketing and sale of our products. There can be no assurance that our products will achieve or maintain market acceptance, result in increased revenues, or be profitable. Parts Shortages and Over-Supplies and Dependence on Suppliers The electronics and components industry is characterized by periodic shortages or over-supplies of parts that have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our operations. We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers and contractors for wireless and semiconductor devices used in our products, and we have no long-term supply contracts with any of them. Due to the cyclical nature of these industries and competitive conditions, we, or our sub-contractors, may experience difficulties in meeting our supply requirements in the future. Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries of parts, either due to the loss of a supplier or industry-wide shortages, could delay shipments of our products, increase our cost of goods sold and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Credit Risks and Dependence on Major Customers We will be granting credit to customers in a variety of commercial industries. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition and collateral is not required. Estimated credit losses are provided for in the financial statements. Our inability to collect receivables from any larger customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 34 The model for accounts receivable for wireless customers may change to a larger customer base and smaller average receivables. Although we have a significant customer, many of our receivables may come from smaller, higher risk development companies. Intellectual Property Rights Our ability to compete effectively is dependent on our proprietary know-how, technology and patent rights. We have applied for additional patents in the wireless area. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any issued patents will afford our products any competitive advantage or that any of our products will not be challenged or circumvented by third parties, or that patents issued to others will not adversely affect the sales, development or commercialization of our present or future products. We are involved from time to time in claims and litigation over intellectual property rights, which may adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products. The wireless industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. We believe that it may be necessary, from time to time, to initiate litigation against one or more third parties to preserve our intellectual property rights. In addition, from time to time, we have received, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties' proprietary rights, which claims could result in litigation. Such litigation would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In the event of an adverse result in such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of certain products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to use the infringed technology. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to obtain a license or our failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms could cause us to incur substantial costs and suspend manufacturing products using the infringed technology. If we obtain a license, we would likely be required to make royalty payments for sales under the license. Such payments would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our gross profit. In addition, any litigation, whether as plaintiff or as defendant, would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is ultimately determined in our favor. In addition, the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain. Management of Growth or Diversification Successful expansion or diversification of the Company's operations will depend on the ability to obtain new customers, to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel, to secure adequate sources of supply on commercially reasonable terms and to successfully manage new product introductions. To manage growth or diversification effectively, we will have to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems, procedures and controls. As we expand or diversify, we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion. Failure to manage growth or diversification effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Competition There are companies that offer or are in the process of developing similar types of wireless products, including Lantronix, Digi-International and others. We could also experience competition from established and emerging network companies. There can be no assurance that our products will be competitive with existing or future products, or that we will be able to establish or maintain a profitable price structure for our products. 35 We expect to face competition from existing competitors and new and emerging companies that may enter our existing or future markets with similar or alternative products, which may be less costly or provide additional features. In addition, some of our significant suppliers are also our competitors, many of whom have the ability to manufacture competitive products at lower costs as a result of their higher levels of integration. We also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally. Competition may arise due to the development of cooperative relationships among our current and potential competitors or third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors will emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products, reduce their prices and introduce new products that may offer greater performance and improved pricing, any of which could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products. In addition, our competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that may render our technology or products obsolete or uncompetitive. Product Liability In the course of our business, we may be subject to claims for product liability for which our insurance coverage is excluded or inadequate. Variability of Gross Margin Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 27% for fiscal year ended February 28, 2005 as compared to a negative margin for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004. Any change in the gross margins can typically be attributed to the type of products, and the amount of purchased memory included in sales during the year as well as the amount of royalty income generated during the periods. As we market our products the product mix may be different and result in changes in the gross margin. We expect that our net sales and gross margin may vary significantly based on these and other factors, including the mix of products sold and the manufacturing services provided, the channels through which our products are sold, changes in product selling prices and component costs, the level of manufacturing efficiencies achieved and pricing by competitors. The selling prices of our products may decline depending upon the price changes of our cost of sales, which would have a material adverse effect on our net sales and could, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or increase net sales will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices. Declining product-selling prices may also materially and adversely affect our gross margin unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to offset declines in product selling prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase unit sales volumes, introduce and sell new products or reduce our cost per unit. We also expect that our business may experience significant seasonality to the extent it sells a material portion of our products in Europe (due to vacation cycles) and to the extent, our exposure to the personal computer market remains significant. Our average sales prices have historically declined, and we anticipate that the average sales prices for our products will continue to decline and could negatively impact our gross profit margins. 36 Decline of Demand for Product Due to Downturn of Related Industries We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to factors affecting the wireless, computer, telecommunications and networking industries. From time to time, each of these industries has experienced downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. A decline or significant shortfall in growth in any one of these industries or a technology shift, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products, and therefore, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that our net sales and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected in the future due to changes in demand from individual customers or cyclical changes in the wireless, computer, telecommunications, networking or other industries utilizing our products. Our suppliers, contract manufacturers or customers could become competitors. Many of our customers internally design and/or manufacture their own wireless communications network products. These customers also continuously evaluate whether to manufacture their own wireless communications network products or utilize contract manufacturers to produce their own internal designs. Certain of our customers and prospective customers regularly produce or design wireless communications network products in an attempt to replace products manufactured by us. We believe that this practice will continue. In the event that our customers manufacture or design their own wireless communications network products, such customers could reduce or eliminate their purchases of our products, which would result in reduced revenues and would adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity. Wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers with internal manufacturing capabilities, including many of our customers, could also sell wireless communications network products externally to other manufacturers, thereby competing directly with us. In addition, our suppliers or contract manufacturers may decide to produce competing products directly for our customers and, effectively, compete against us. If, for any reason, our customers produce their wireless communications network products internally, increase the percentage of their internal production, require us to participate in joint venture manufacturing with them, engage our suppliers or contract manufacturers to manufacture competing products, or otherwise compete directly against us, our revenues would decrease, which would adversely impact our results of operations International Sales In fiscal year 2005, approximately 15% of our sales were export sales, primarily to Canada and Western Europe as compared to 12% in fiscal year 2004 and none for 2003. Foreign sales are made in U.S. dollars. The increase was primarily due to the wireless product being available for sale and new customers overseas. International sales may be subject to certain risks, including changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, timing and availability of export licenses, political and economic instability, difficulties in accounts receivable collections, natural disasters, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations, difficulties in managing distributors, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for telecommunications and other products, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties, potentially adverse tax consequences and uncertainties relative to regional, political and economic circumstances. Moreover, and as a result of currency changes and other factors, our competitors may have the ability to manufacture competitive products in Asia or otherwise at lower cost than we would incur to have them manufactured. We are also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products. We cannot predict whether the United States or other countries will implement quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products. Because sales of our products have been denominated to 37 date in United States dollars, increases in the value of the United States dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country, leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country. Future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales. Gains and losses on the conversion to United States dollars of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations. Some of our customers' purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws, which may differ significantly from United States laws. Therefore, we may be limited in our ability to enforce any rights under such agreements and to collect damages, if awarded. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Limited Experience in Business Combinations or Acquisitions We are pursuing a strategy of acquiring additional companies or businesses. We are in the process of one transaction. We may pursue selective acquisitions to complement our internal growth. If the present transaction closes, we will issue stock that would dilute our shareholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, and use other company assets available at the time of acquisition. If and when we make any future combinations or acquisitions, we could do so again. We have limited experience in acquiring other businesses, product lines and technologies. In addition, the attention of our management team may be diverted from our core business if we undertake an acquisition. Potential acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including, among others: Problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies or products; Costs associated with the acquisition; Adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; Sudden market changes; Risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; Potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations; and Potential litigation arising from the acquired company's operations before the acquisition. Our inability to overcome problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions could divert the attention of management, utilize scarce corporate resources and harm our business. In addition, we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed. Cyclical Nature of Wireless and Electronics Industries The wireless and the electronics industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both the producing companies' and their customers' products and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, any upturn in these industries could result in increased demand for, and possible shortages of, components we use to manufacture and assemble our products. Such shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 38 Our reliance on one contract manufacturer exposes us to risks of excess inventory or inventory carrying costs. If our contract manufacturer is unable to respond promptly and timely to changes in customer demand, we may be unable to produce enough products to respond to sudden increases in demand resulting in lost revenues, or alternatively, in the case of order cancellations or decreases in demand, we may be liable for excess or obsolete inventory or cancellation charges resulting from contractual purchase commitments that we have with our contract manufacturers. We regularly provide rolling forecasts of our requirements to our contract manufacturers for planning purposes, pursuant to our agreements, a portion of which is binding upon us. Additionally, we are committed to accept delivery on the forecasted terms for a portion of the rolling forecast. Cancellations of orders or changes to the forecasts provided to any of our contract manufacturers may result in cancellation costs payable by us. By using a contract manufacturer, our ability to directly control the use of all inventory is reduced since we do not have full operating control over their operations. If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our contract manufacturer and manage the costs associated with our contract manufacturer, we may be required to pay inventory carrying costs or purchase excess inventory. If we or our contract manufacturer are unable to utilize such excess inventory in a timely manner, and are unable to sell excess components or products due to their customized nature, our operating results and liquidity would be negatively impacted. Product Returns and Order Cancellation To the extent we have products manufactured in anticipation of future demand and that does not materialize, or in the event a customer cancels outstanding orders, we could experience an unanticipated increase in our inventory. In addition, while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products, and have typically not done so in the past, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers. Product returns would increase our inventory and reduce our revenues. We have had to write-down inventory in the past for reasons such as obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs. We have no long-term volume commitments from our customers that are not subject to cancellation by the customer. Sales of our products are made through individual purchase orders and, in certain cases, are made under master agreements governing the terms and conditions of the relationships. Customers may change, cancel or delay orders with limited or no penalties. We have experienced cancellations of orders and fluctuations in order levels from period-to-period and we expect to continue to experience similar cancellations and fluctuations in the future that could result in fluctuations in our revenues. Additional Capital Funding to Impair Value of Investment We need to raise additional capital. Our potential means to raise capital potentially include public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Our present financial condition mandates that we obtain additional financing for the sake of continuing operations until our revenues from operations have grown. We need to obtain financing in connection with QuaTech, Inc. to complete that transaction. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our research, development, sales and marketing activities, acquisitions, and other costs. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or will be available on terms favorable to us. If we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms, we would not be able to complete our transaction with QuaTech, Inc. and shall not be able to continue developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock. To 39 the extent we raise additional capital by issuing debt, our shareholders would incur additional interest expenses that would reduce earnings and cash flow of the Company Also, plans to borrow and repay the debt are subject to numerous risks. In the event the debt is not repaid as and when due, additional costs and debt would be incurred to satisfy and refinance the obligation, and the debt therefore could grow. If a company's debt coverage costs are excessive, its equity can lose value for reasons including a decline in creditworthiness. Geographic Concentration of Operation For the wireless products none of our manufacturing operations are located in our facility in Garden Grove, California. Our wireless product line is manufactured overseas in Taiwan, with some contract manufacturing conducted locally. Due to the geographic concentration, a disruption of the manufacturing operations, resulting from sustained process abnormalities, human error, government intervention or natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires or floods could cause us to cease or limit our sub-contractors operations and consequently harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, waste water discharge, waste storage, treatment and disposal, and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. Our failure to comply with present and future requirements could harm our ability to continue manufacturing our products. Such requirements could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. The imposition of additional or more stringent environmental requirements, the results of future testing at our facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for remediation at other sites where problems are not presently known to us, could result in expenses in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. Key Personnel The Company may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical sales, marketing and managerial personnel required to operate its business successfully. DPAC's future success depends, in part, upon ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with proper skills is intense. Also, attrition in personnel can result from, among other things, changes related to acquisitions, as well as retirement or disability. The Company may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel in the future. If the Company is unable to retain existing key employees or is unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, business, financial condition and results of operations of DPAC could be materially and adversely affected. Stock Price Volatility and Market Overhang Existing shareholders may suffer with each adverse change in the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock will be affected by a variety of factors in the future. Most obviously, our shares may suffer adversely if and when our future operating results are below the expectations of investors. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of technology companies in particular, experiences extreme price fluctuations. Our common stock market price is made more volatile because of the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock. When trading is sporadic, significant price movement can be caused by a relatively small number of shares. 40 Another factor that may affect our common stock price will be the number of our outstanding shares and, at times, the number and prices of warrants that could be exercised. We have reserved a total of 1,480,292 shares for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants. Holders of our warrants hold registration rights that are intended to make the warrant shares immediately available for public sale upon exercise, and warrants may be exercised at any time until their expiration. It is foreseeable that when a warrant has an intrinsic value, which is usually called being "in-the-money," the holder may desire to exercise the warrant and immediately sell the stock. If our common stock trades at prices higher than a warrant's exercise price, the shares can be sold at a profit. At such times, sales of large numbers of shares received upon exercises of warrants might materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. An additional factor that independently affects the common stock is a potential future adjustment to certain outstanding warrants that, until such provision expires by its own terms on May 5, 2009 will be adjusted to that lower exercise price if we sell stock; however, the number of shares purchasable with the warrant is constant. For example, there are presently 730,794 shares purchasable at $1.235 each under those warrants; but if we were to sell shares of common stock (except in certain instances defined as excluded issuances) at, for instance, $0.40 each, the warrants would become warrants to purchase 730,794 shares at $0.40 each. The adjustments can reduce the warrants' exercise price but not increase it. Other Contingent Contractual Obligations The Company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets. However, during its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include indemnities to all directors and officers pertaining to claims on account of acting as a director or officer. In the event that the Company has, or is claimed to have, any indemnification obligation related to current or former directors or officers, the costs and expenses could be material to the Company and the amount of cost and expense of such an obligation would not necessarily be limited whatsoever. Other indemnities are made to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease; other indemnities are made to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company; and other indemnities involve the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts and are made in favor of the other contractual party. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies and, in certain cases, may be indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments the Company could be obligated to make. The Company may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts, which would customarily be for a limited amount. Product warranty costs are not significant. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company invests excess cash in money market funds, held primarily in one financial institution. Money market funds do not have maturity dates and do not present a significant market risk. For fiscal year 2005, interest expense was not sensitive to the general level of the U.S. interest rates because our debt instruments, consisting principally of capital lease agreements, were based on fixed interest rates. The Company's export sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our Financial Statements are included in this Report commencing at page F-l. 41 The following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data derived from our unaudited financial statements for each of the quarters in our fiscal years ended February 29, 2005 and February 28, 2004, adjusted to reflect reclassifications for discontinued operations. Such financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual Financial Statements and, include all necessary adjustments, which consists only of normal and recurring accruals to present fairly such interim financial information.

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. During our fourth fiscal quarter, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of DPAC Technologies Corp. (the "Company") as of February 28, 2005 and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended February 28, 2005. Our audit also included the information in the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15 as of and for the year ended February 28, 2005. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DPAC Technologies Corp. as of February 28, 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended February 28, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We also audited the adjustments for discontinued operations described in Note 3 that were applied to restate the 2004 and 2003 financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has a experience continuing losses from operations and negative operating cash flow. Additionally, the Company's current cash balances are expected to be sufficient to fund its operations and other obligations through February 28, 2006. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. /s/ Moss Adams, LLP Irvine, California June 2, 2005 F-1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders DPAC Technologies Corp.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THREE YEARS IN THE PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of OperationsDPAC Technologies Corp. (formerly Dense-Pac Microsystems, Inc.) ("DPAC" or the "Company" or "we" or "our") is a provider of wireless connectivity products for industrial, transportation, medical and other commercial applications. The products are designed to enable OEM equipment designers to incorporate 802.11 wireless LAN connectivity into their device, instrument or equipment through the inclusion of the Company's Wireless LAN Node Module in their system design. The Company also sells AirborneDirect plug-and-play wireless products that add 802.11 wireless connectivity to legacy instruments and equipment that have a pre-existing serial or Ethernet data port. During fiscal 2005, the Company sold its Industrial, Defense and Aerospace ("IDA") product line and ceased the sale and production of memory stacking services to providers of high-density memory boards. These product lines comprised the majority of the Company's historical revenues. The results of operations and any remaining assets for these product lines are treated as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements, which have been restated to reflect the discontinued operations treatment for all periods presented. Except where otherwise noted, the financial information contained herein represents our continuing operations, and excludes the discontinued IDA and memory stacking products. Basis of PresentationThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Some historical amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current financial presentation Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during reporting years. Actual results could differ from those estimates New Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123R (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"), which requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on alternative fair value models. The share-based compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. We currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually. Upon adoption, the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition. The provisions of SFAS 123R are effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard. The adoption of this standard will result in an increase in compensation expense and a reduction to net income and net income per common share and is expected to have a material effect on the results of operations. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS 151 requires that these costs be recognized as current period F-7 charges regardless of whether they are abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of manufacturing be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this new standard may have on our financial position or results of operations. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. At February 28, 2005, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were substantially uninsured and were held primarily with one financial institution. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of insured limits may be subject to risk. InventoriesWe value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months. We consider additional facts and circumstances, in order to determine that any condition exists that would confirm or deny the need for recording a write-off. Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally ranging from 3 to 12 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the term of the related lease. The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. ("SFAS No.") 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances, which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, based on management's best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time, to the carrying amount of the assets. If the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows, the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company, during fiscal year 2005 and 2004, determined that an impairment had occurred of its production fixed assets and the fixed assets procured for discontinued product lines. See Notes 3, 4 and 6 for additional information. GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or when a possible impairment is indicated, using the fair value based test prescribed by SFAS 142. Since we operate in a single business segment as a single business unit, the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based on a comparison of the fair value of the entire Company to the accounting value of our net assets. In estimating the fair value of the entire Company, we review the average and closing stock F-8 prices for our Common Stock, as well as other factors including using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the fair value of the entire Company is determined to be less than the accounting value of our net assets, we could be required to record an impairment loss for our goodwill that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such charge was recorded. Pursuant to SFAS 142, the Company performed its annual valuation to determine if an impairment of goodwill had occurred as of February 28, 2005. The Company reviewed the market value of its outstanding common stock, as well as subjective valuations based on projections of revenues, costs of goods sold, operating margins and cash flows. Based on these analyses, the Company concluded that projected future cash flows to be generated from operations were not sufficient to substantiate a fair value of the entire Company to support the accounting value of our net assets. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded that the entire amount goodwill had been impaired and, therefore, recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.5 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. The Company did not record any similar impairment charge during fiscal year 2004. Revenue RecognitionRevenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain products are made to foreign electronic component distributors under agreements, which do not have a right to return unsold products. A reserve for defective products is recorded for other customers based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve. Development revenue is recognized when services are performed and was not significant for any of the periods presented. Advertising ExpensesThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. These costs were not material for the years ended February 28, 2005, February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2003. Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial statements and tax reporting purposes. Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset, SFAS No. 109 requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. During the year ended February 28, 2005, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance associated with its net deferred tax assets. See Note 7 for additional information. Net Income per ShareThe Company computes net income per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution of securities by including other common stock equivalents, including stock options, in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for a period, if dilutive. F-9 The table below sets forth the reconciliation of the denominator of the earnings per share calculation: 2005 2004 2003 Shares used in computing basic net income (loss) per share 23,319,395 21,102,387 21,010,700 Dilutive effect of stock options(1) and warrants(2)   222,600 Shares used in computing diluted net income (loss) per share 23,319,395 21,102,387 21,233,300 (1)312,869, 443,467 and 222,600 potential common shares have been excluded from diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. (2)Excluded from the diluted weighted average common shares for fiscal year 2005 are 2,514,410 warrants issued in conjunction with the private placement of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. These options were excluded because the exercise prices of these options were greater than the average market price of our common stock for the period. There were no warrants of outstanding as February 29, 2004 or February 28, 2003. Stock-Based CompensationPursuant to SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option and purchase plans. As a result, the Company only records compensation expense for stock-based awards granted with an exercise price below the market value of the Company's stock on the measurement date. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, requires the disclosure of pro forma net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share. Under SFAS No. 123, and as amended by SFAS No. 148, the fair value of stock-based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option-pricing models even though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from the Company's stock option awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. The Company's calculations are based on a single-option valuation approach and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the fair values of the awards had been amortized to expense over the F-10 vesting period of the awards, results would have been as follows for the respective fiscal years ended February: 2005 2004 2003 Loss from continuing operations as reported $ (10,703,422 ) $ (10,800,785 ) $ (2,598,888 ) Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects in 2003 54,599 301,560 3,034 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation determined under fair value based method for all awards net of related tax effects (505,378 ) (1,079,562 ) (678,504 ) Pro forma net loss from continuing operations $ (11,154,201 ) $ (11,578,787 ) $ (3,274,358 ) Net loss per share as reported: Basic $ (0.46 ) $ (0.51 ) $ (0.12 ) Diluted $ (0.46 ) $ (0.51 ) $ (0.12 ) Pro forma net loss per share: Basic $ (0.48 ) $ (0.55 ) $ (0.16 ) Diluted $ (0.48 ) $ (0.55 ) $ (0.16 ) The Company's calculations were made using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions: Assumptions 2005 2004 2003 Expected life (months) 35 38 39 Stock volatility 94 % 102 % 106 % Risk-free interest rate 3 % 4 % 5 % Dividends during the expected term None None None As previously discussed, the FASB issued SFAS 123R in December 2004, which will require the Company to begin expensing stock options in the beginning of fiscal year 2007. Significant Outsource ManufacturerThe Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its wireless products but has no long-term supply contracts with any of them. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience difficulties in meeting its supply requirements in the future. Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries of parts, either due to the loss of a supplier or industrywide shortages, could delay shipments of the Company's products, increase its cost of goods sold, and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The wireless product is manufactured overseas in Taiwan, with some contract manufacturing conducted locally. Due to the geographic concentration, a disruption of the manufacturing operations resulting from sustained process abnormalities, human error, government intervention or natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires or floods could cause the Company to cease or limit subcontractors' F-11 operations and consequently harm the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Concentration of Sales and Credit RiskThe Company grants credit to customers based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition and collateral is not required. Estimated credit losses are provided for in the financial statements. A decision by a significant customer to substantially decrease or delay purchases from the Company or the Company's inability to collect receivables from these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Comprehensive IncomeThe Company had no items of other comprehensive income for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003. 2. LIQUIDITY The Company has incurred losses from continuing operations for each of the last three fiscal years. At February 28, 2005, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 million, working capital of $1.5 million and a current ratio of 1.8 to 1. This compares to a cash balance of $4.5 million, working capital of $4.3 million and a current ratio of 2.8 to 1 at February 29, 2004. Management expects the Company will continue to consume cash for the next several quarters. The rate at which cash will be consumed is primarily dependent on the amount of revenues realized during each period. Based on the Company's current cash flow requirements, management believes that our positive cash position, and our current credit facility will not be adequate to continue to maintain liquidity throughout the ensuing fiscal year. This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will seek to close the merger with QuaTech and continue to seek additional equity financing or their financing in order to finance it obligation's as they are due. There can be no assurance that additional financing would be available if and when needed on terms favorable to the Company. 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As a result of the significant decline in the demand for the Company's legacy stacking products experienced during fiscal year 2004 and continuing into fiscal year 2005, the Company implemented a number of restructuring initiatives to focus future endeavors of the Company on the Airborne product line. On June 14, 2004, DPAC sold all of its memory stacking patent and patent applications and related excess inventory associated with our legacy commercial product line for $670,000 in cash. Under the agreement, DPAC accepted agreed upon orders for LP Stacks subject to material and capacity availability through July 30, 2004 and all orders were shipped no later than August 6, 2004. In conjunction with the sale, the Company's memory stacking product line was discontinued. This product line accounted for $16.3 million (or 83%) of the Company's net sales during fiscal year 2004 and $3.9 million (or 56%) of the Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2005. Accordingly, the Company completed the planned shut down of its in-house manufacturing, disposed of all related manufacturing equipment and vacated the portion of its leased facility utilized for F-12 manufacturing purposes during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. The product lines are classified as discontinued operations beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2005. On May 6, 2004, DPAC reached an agreement with a third party to sell DPAC's industrial, defense and aerospace (IDA) memory product line. The agreement transferred all of our relevant licensed rights to the specified technology and product line, and certain inventory and assets for $333,000 in cash and contingent future consideration based on the revenues of the product lines for the next two years. The amount of the additional consideration cannot yet be determined. The entire IDA product line, including royalty revenues, accounted for $3.16 million (or 16%) of the Company's net sales during fiscal year 2004 and $1.7 million (or 24%) of the Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2005. In conjunction with the sale of the memory stacking product line as well as the shut down of the Company's manufacturing process, the Company determined that, after completing shipments of existing IDA orders, it would no longer have continuing significant involvement with the IDA product line. The product line was categorized as discontinued during the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," both the IDA and memory stacking product lines are classified as discontinued operations and the related financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods F-13 presented. Certain financial information regarding these product lines included in discontinued operations is set forth below: Year ended, February 28, 2005 February 29, 2004 February 28, 2003 Revenue $ 5,563,672 $ 19,471,397 $ 34,489,465 Cost of sales and operating expenses 4,886,508 20,811,718 29,359,743 Restructuring and impairment charges 1,159,432 1,783,198 Gain on sale of assets 720,692 Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax effect 238,424 (3,123,519 ) 5,056,765 February 28, 2005 February 29, 2004 Accounts receivable, net $ 164,134 $ 1,351,950 Inventories  394,983 Property, net  1,274,204 Total assets $ 164,134 $ 3,021,137 Current portion of capital leases $ 109,800 $ 160,081 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 20,087 867,832 Accrued restructuring costscurrent 338,065 83,418 Deferred revenue  80,184 Total current liabilities 467,952 1,191,515 Accrued restructuring costs- long term 303,447 106,979 Capital leases, net of current portion 139,978 254,060 Total Liabilities $ 911,377 $ 1,552,554 During the year ended February 28, 2005, the Company recorded net restructuring charges related to discontinued operations of $1.2 million, which included severance charges of $864,000 and a reserve for vacated excess facilities of $295,000. The severance charges are the result of a reduction in workforce of 33 individuals. The accrued severance charges are payable over the period ending December 31, 2006. F-14 A summary of the activity that affected the Company's accrued restructuring costs for discontinued operations during fiscal years 2004 and 2005 is as follows: Employee Severance Equipment Write-downs Facilities and Lease Termination Total Balance at 2/28/03 $  $  $  $  Amounts expensed 503,749 2,001,941 496,000 3,001,690 Amounts paid / incurred (413,352 ) (2,001,941 ) (396,000 ) (2,811,293 ) Balance at 2/29/04 $ 90,397 $  $ 100,000 $ 190,397 Amounts expensed 864,432  295,000 1,159,432 Amounts paid / incurred (560,733 )  (147,584 ) (708,317 ) Balance 2/28/05 $ 394,096 $  $ 247,416 $ 641,512 All of the charges reflected in the above table are included in gain or loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

SHORT-TERM DEBT At February 28, 2005, the Company had $147,000 of short-term debt, with an annual interest rate of 5.5%, payable monthly, through July 2005. The Company has a line of credit with a bank providing for borrowings of up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined, not to exceed $2,000,000. Available borrowings at February 28, 2005 were approximately $200,000. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets and expires in June 2005. There were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at February 28, 2005. The agreement requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants that the Company was in compliance with at February 28, 2005. Such covenants also restrict the Company's ability to pay any dividends on its common stock. 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CommitmentsThe Company leases its office and operation facilities under an operating lease arrangement that expires on April 30, 2007. The facility lease requires additional payments for property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Additionally, the Company leases certain equipment under capital leases. The following table summarizes the future minimum payments under the Company's operating and capital leases at February 28, 2005: Fiscal Year Ending Capital Operating 2006 $ 123,507 $ 286,509 2007 110,265 297,170 2008 36,755 49,028 Total minimum lease payments 270,527 629,708 Less amounts representing interest (20,749 ) Present value of minimum lease payments 249,778  Less current portion (109,800 )  Long-term portion $ 139,978 $  F-16 Rent expense relating to operating leases was approximately $331,000, $381,000 and $531,000 for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Other Contingent Contractual ObligationsDuring its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include: intellectual property indemnities to the Company's customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products; indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease; indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company; indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts; and indemnities to directors and officers of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of California. The Company may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies and, in certain cases, may be indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments the Company could be obligated to make. The Company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets. LitigationThe Company is involved from time-to-time in a variety of other legal and administrative proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the outcome of any currently pending other legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements. 8. IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS As a result of the significant decline in the demand for the Company's stacking products, the Company implemented a number of restructuring initiatives to focus future endeavors of the Company on the Airborne product line and to transition to an outsourced manufacturing model. During fiscal year ended February 28, 2005, the Company recorded net restructuring charges affecting continuing operations of $665,000, which are comprised of severance charges as the result of a reduction in workforce of ten individuals, including the company's prior CFO. The accrued severance charges are payable over the period ending December 2006. F-17 A summary of the activity that affected the Company's accrued restructuring costs of continuing operations during fiscal years 2004 and 2005 is as follows: Employee Severance Balance at 2/29/03 $  Amounts expensed 870,854 Amounts paid / incurred (54,155 ) Balance at 2/29/04 $ 816,699 Amounts expensed 665,086 Amounts paid / incurred (596,663 ) Balance 2/28/05 $ 885,122 All of the charges reflected in the above table are included in restructuring charges of continuing operations in the accompanying financial statements.

The income tax effects of these temporary differences representing significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows at February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004: 2005 2004 Deferred tax assets: Inventories $ 48,491 $ 194,083 Other reserves 429,856 447,071 Impairment and restructuring costs 234,485 Net operating loss carryforwards, general business credit carryforwards and AMT credit carryforwards 10,974,891 7,757,705 Total gross deferred assets 11,453,238 8,633,344 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization (360,134 ) (70,674 ) State taxes (519,990 ) (342,711 ) Total deferred tax liabilities 10,573,114 8,219,959 Valuation allowance (10,573,114 ) (8,219,959 ) Net deferred income taxes $  $  As of February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004, a valuation allowance of $10,573,114 and $8,219,959 has been provided based upon the Company's assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets, as it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to realize these temporary differences. During fiscal year 2004, the Company established a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets, resulting in a charge to 2004 fiscal earnings of $4.8 million. In fiscal year 2003, the Company reversed a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets totaling $5,279,915. Based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets, the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid-in capital of $2,701,701, a reduction of Goodwill in the amount of $254,200, and a net income tax benefit of $2,324,014. The reversal was the F-19 result of the Company's history of operating profitability and the determination by management that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was more likely than not at that time. The fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 valuation allowances were calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Evidence evaluated by management included operating results during the most recent three-year period and future projections, with more weight given to historical results than expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. The Company's net losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets under SFAS 109. This valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and could be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets. As of February 28, 2005, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $27,045,000 and $15,085,000, respectively. Unless utilized, the federal net operating losses begin to expire in 2012, while the state net operating losses begin to expire in 2010. As of February 28, 2005, the Company had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $275,000 and $172,000, respectively. The federal tax credits begin to expire in 2008, while the state tax credits begin to expire in 2005. 10. PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF COMMON STOCK On May 6, 2004, the Company completed a private placement of approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock and warrants for net proceeds of approximately $1.8 million. In conjunction with the sale of stock, the Company issued warrants to purchase additional common stock. The Series A warrants expire in five years and are exercisable for approximately 1.24 million additional shares of common stock to the investors at $1.24 per share. Of these Series A Warrants, 968,836 are called "Restricted" as they were not exercisable until November 5, 2004. The remaining Series A warrants are immediately exercisable. The Series A warrants were not exercised as of November 2004 and have expired. The Series B warrants expire 320 days after July 14, 2004 and are immediately exercisable for approximately 1.03 million additional shares of common stock to the investors at $.97 per share. The placement agent has received warrants to purchase approximately 238,000 shares of common stock at $1.07 per share that were not exercisable until November 5, 2004, and that will expire in five years. The warrants are callable by DPAC under certain conditions. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: (a)expected life equal to the contract life of each warrant, (b)100% volatility and 3.7% risk-free interest rate for the Series A and placement agent warrants, and (c)94% volatility and 1.5% risk-free interest rate for the Series B warrants. This calculation resulted in the following valuations: $700,000 for the Series A warrants, $240,000 for the Series B warrants, and $140,000 for the placement agent warrants. The value ascribed to the warrants has been treated as a reduction to common stock issued in the private placement. F-20 11. EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS Under the terms of the Company's 1996 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), options to purchase 6,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock are available for issuance to employees, officers, directors, and consultants. The plan was modified in fiscal year 2002 to increase the total number of options in the plan by 4% of the number of outstanding shares of common stock each year until the end of the option plan. Options issued under this Plan are granted with exercise prices at fair market value and generally vest at a rate of 25% to 50% per year and expire within 10 years from the date of grant or upon 90 days after termination of employment. At February 28, 2005, 3,028,272 shares were available for future grants under the Plan. During the years ended February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004, the Company granted 125,000 and 24,000 options to non-employees to purchase common shares at an average price of $0.59 and $1.02. Some of these stock options vest over time and are subject to revaluation, where the fair value of the non-vested options is adjusted every reporting period throughout the vesting schedule. The total value of the options granted to non-employees was determined to be $25,424 and $17,727 respectively for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and was recorded as an expense in the accompanying financial statements. Also during fiscal years 2005 and 2004, the Company accelerated vesting on certain employee options in connection with their separation from the Company. As a result of the modification to accelerate the vesting of these stock options, the Company recorded $29,175 compensation expense for fiscal year 2005 and $283,833 for fiscal year 2004 of stock compensation expense representing the difference between the original strike price and the price of the common stock on the modification date. During the year ended February 28, 2003, the Company granted 6,000 options to non-employees to purchase common shares at $1.42 per share. The options vested 100% on January 14, 2003 and expire the earlier of (1) two years after service termination, or (2) 10 years from date of grant. The value of the options was determined to be $5,056 utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant and was recorded as expense in the accompanying financial statements.
