ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our business faces significant risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. If any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Pep Boys If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, our liquidity will suffer and we may be unable to satisfy our obligations. We require significant capital to fund our business. While we believe we have the ability to sufficiently fund our planned operations and capital expenditures for the balance of fiscal year 2007, circumstances could arise that would materially affect our liquidity. For example, cash flows from our operations could be affected by changes in consumer spending habits or the failure to maintain favorable vendor payment terms or our inability to successfully implement sales growth initiatives. We may be unsuccessful in securing alternative financing when needed, on terms that we consider acceptable, or at all. 7 The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to your investment in our securities, including the following risks: · our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future; · a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes; · our failure to comply with financial and operating restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries by our credit facilities could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or our prospects; and · if we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors, we might be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. We depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of these relationships or of our vendors operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our business depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with our vendors. Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships. For example, financial difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them. In addition, our failure to promptly pay, or order sufficient quantities of inventory from our vendors may increase the cost of products we purchase or may lead to vendors refusing to sell products to us at all. A disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We depend on our senior management team and our other personnel, and we face substantial competition for qualified personnel. Our success depends in part on the efforts of our senior management team. Our continued success will also depend upon our ability to retain existing, and attract additional, qualified field personnel to meet our needs. We face substantial competition, both from within and outside of the automotive aftermarket to retain and attract qualified personnel. In addition, we believe that the number of qualified automotive service technicians in the industry is generally insufficient to meet demand. We are subject to environmental laws and may be subject to environmental liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products we sell and use in our service bays, the recycling of batteries, tires and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property. As a result of investigations undertaken in connection with a number of our store acquisitions and financings, we are aware that soil or groundwater may be contaminated at some of our properties. Any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Risks Related to Our Industry Our industry is highly competitive, and price competition in some categories of the automotive aftermarket or a loss of trust in our participation in the do-it-for-me market, could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings. 8 The automotive aftermarket retail and service industry is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with the following types of businesses in each category of the automotive aftermarket: Do-It-Yourself Retail · automotive parts and accessories stores; · automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories; and · mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and select non-automotive merchandise that appeals to automotive Do-It-Yourself customers, such as generators, power tools and canopies. Do-It-For-Me Service Labor · regional and local full service automotive repair shops; · automobile dealers that provide repair and maintenance services; · national and regional (including franchised) tire retailers that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services; and · national and regional (including franchised) specialized automotive (such as exhaust, brake and transmission) repair facilities that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services. Installed Merchandise/Commercial · mass merchandisers, wholesalers and jobbers (some of which are associated with national parts distributors or associations). Tire Sales · national and regional (including franchised) tire retailers; and · mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell tires. A number of our competitors have more financial resources, are more geographically diverse or have better name recognition than we do, which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors. Because we seek to offer competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices we may also be forced to reduce our prices, which could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings and hinder our ability to service our debt. With respect to the service labor category, the majority of consumers are unfamiliar with their vehicles mechanical operation and, as a result, often select a service provider based on trust. Potential occurrences of negative publicity associated with the Pep Boys brand, the products we sell or installation or repairs performed in our service bays, whether or not factually accurate, could cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services in the short or long term, and cause them to choose our competitors for their automotive service needs. 9 Vehicle miles driven may decrease, resulting in a decline of our revenues and negatively affecting our results of operations. Our industry depends on the number of vehicle miles driven. Factors that may cause the number of vehicle miles and our revenues and our results of operations to decrease include: · the weatheras vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather; · the economyas during periods of poor economic conditions, customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair, and during periods of good economic conditions, consumers may opt to purchase new vehicles rather than service the vehicles they currently own and replace worn or damaged parts; · gas pricesas increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles; and · travel patternsas changes in travel patterns may cause consumers to rely more heavily on train and airplane transportation.
