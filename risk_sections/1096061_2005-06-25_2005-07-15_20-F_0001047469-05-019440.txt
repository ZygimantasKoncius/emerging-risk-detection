D. Risk Factors General If you are considering purchasing our shares or American Depositary Receipts, you should carefully read and think about all the information contained in this document, including the risk factors set out below, prior to making any investment decision. State-related entities have a substantial holding. Following a decision by the Greek government, the Hellenic Republic disposed of its entire stake in the Bank on November 12, 2004. Previously, the Hellenic Republic held 1.31% and 6.15% of the total shares of the Bank directly and through DEKA, respectively. As a result, at present the Hellenic Republic does not own any shares of the Bank, either directly or through DEKA. However, the Hellenic Republic continues to exercise a significant degree of indirect influence on the Bank, through certain state-related entities, primarily pension funds (most of whose boards of directors are appointed by the Hellenic Republic), which own shares representing approximately 22.6% of the issued share capital of the Bank. See Item 7.A, "Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsState Interests" and Item 10.J, "Additional InformationRelationship with the Hellenic Republic." The holdings of the state-related entities referred to above are substantial and may allow the Hellenic Republic to have significant influence over decisions submitted to a vote of the Bank's shareholders. The Bank's Articles of Association do not provide for any special voting rights to any class of shares or shareholders and there is no law in Greece that gives control of the Bank to the Hellenic Republic. However, if there is not a full voting participation by all of the Bank's shareholders at a given shareholders' meeting, these state-related entities, despite having less than a majority of ownership in the Bank, may have a voting majority at such meeting. This would allow them to influence the election of members of the Bank's Board of Directors, including the Chairman. Legislation has been passed requiring our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to be nominated directly by our Board of Directors, as opposed to being nominated by the Greek government, as used to be the case. However, if there is a change in the government of Greece, no assurance can be given that members of the Bank's current senior management will continue to serve in their present capacities or that our commercial initiatives and policies will be continued. For example, a general election was held in Greece on March 7, 2004, in which Kostas Karamanlis, the leader of the New Democracy party, was elected Prime Minister with a majority in Parliament, replacing Kostas Simitis of the Socialist party. Following the elections, a majority of the senior management of the Bank was changed. Group initiatives aimed at increasing our profitability may not be successful. In recent years, we have been continuing to develop and implement initiatives to enhance profitability and reduce costs. These initiatives include: applying an early voluntary retirement program in the second half of 2004 reducing the Bank's personnel by approximately 10%. In addition, our principal insurance subsidiary, Ethniki Hellenic General Insurance, implemented a voluntary retirement program, which reduced its personnel by approximately 15%; restructuring the Bank's domestic and international branch network to facilitate cross-sales of the Group's products and services, such as insurance, brokerage, credit cards and mutual funds, through the Bank's branch network; improving our mix of assets by gradually increasing customer lending to sectors with higher interest margins, such as small- and medium-sized enterprises (referred to in this Annual Report as "SMEs"), mortgage and consumer loan sectors; 10 expanding in emerging markets, primarily in the southeastern regions of Europe and the Mediterranean, including Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Cyprus, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia-Montenegro; upgrading our information technology systems; and implementing new systems for effective risk management. Although we have experienced certain benefits to date, which management believes are attributable to these initiatives, we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience such benefits or will obtain all the intended benefits of these initiatives. Our strategy's success depends partly on factors outside our control, such as the development of the Greek economy, political and economic conditions in emerging markets into which we have expanded and intend to expand and the performance of the economies of the other countries that have adopted the euro as their currency. We could have significant pension liabilities in the future. In common with certain large companies in Greece that are, or were formerly, in the public sector, the employees of the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries participate in employee-managed pension funds rather than in standard, state-sponsored social security programs. These employee-managed pension funds and state sponsored social security programs have experienced actuarial and even operating (i.e., cashflow) deficits. The Bank makes significant employer contributions to these employee pension schemes. In recent years, the Greek government has introduced legislation addressing the growing actuarial and operating deficits of Greek pension schemes. Legislation passed in 1992 provides that public and ex-public employers, including the Bank, are not liable for the annual operating deficit of their company-specific main pension funds beyond the amount of 1992 deficits. In 2002, the Hellenic Republic passed legislation under which it provided that the plans that operate in the form of public law entities, including the Bank's employees' Main Pension Plan, would merge with the State sponsored Main Social Security Fund by the end of 2008. In June 2005, the Greek government passed a new law permiting certain bank employee pension schemes to merge into state-sponsored pension funds, as originally provided in the 2002 legislation by the end of 2005. The new law applies to the Bank's employees' Main Pension Plan and Auxiliary Pension Plan. Under the new law, merger of the funds will only occur at the option of the relevant employer and the relevant pension fund. Although the stated purpose behind the new law is to provide assistance to existing pension plans in covering any actuarial or operating deficit, the new law does not address the payment of pension deficits in detail, but rather delegates the matter to Presidential Decrees and Ministerial Decisions to be issued pursuant to the law after conducting special financial studies. Because the Bank's employees' Main Pension Plan had an aggregate GRD 8.6 billion (EUR 25.2 million) deficit in 1992, under the 1992 legislation the Bank is not responsible for operating deficits over EUR 25.2 million per year after 1992 with respect to the Main Pension Plan. It is currently unclear what effect the new law could have on the Bank if the Main Pension Plan and Auxiliary Pension Plan were merged into state-sponsored funds. In addition to the Main Pension Plan, the Bank and several of its subsidiaries offer certain other post-retirement benefit plans, including medical benefit plans. The Bank believes that it has no current legal obligation to make up any deficits under any of its funds. There can be no assurance that the new law or any future changes to existing law regarding pensions and pension liabilities will not require the Bank or certain of its subsidiaries to make higher contributions or provide funds to cover current or future operating deficits of its pension plans above existing limits, or that further reforms or changes will not be effected. For more information on the Group's pension plans, see Note 36 to the U.S. GAAP financial statements included in this Annual Report. 11 The Greek banking sector has been subject to significant strikes. From June 7 to June 30, 2005, the Union of Greek Bank Employees (OTOE) was on strike over proposed pension reform legislation under consideration by the Greek Parliament. The legislation was proposed to address the levels of pension fund deficits affecting pension schemes of certain Greek banks. See "We may have significant pension liabilities in the future" in this Item 3.D. The legislation, which was passed on June 30, 2005, permits the employee-managed pension schemes of certain banks, including those of the Bank, to merge into state sponsored pension funds, and could affect the pension benefits of certain Bank employees who have been employed since 1993. The Bank believes that the strikes could have an adverse impact on the Bank's operations for the current financial year. We face significant competition from Greek and foreign banks. The Group faces significant competition from Greek banks and financial services companies that provide products and services similar to our own. Deregulation has led to increased competition in the Greek banking sector. Consolidation among Greek banks has also led to increased competition resulting from the increased efficiency and greater resources of such merged entities. We also face competition from foreign banks, many of which have resources significantly greater than our own. Notwithstanding our leading position in Greece, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with domestic and international banks in the future. Our ability to reduce staff is limited. Part of our strategy is to increase profitability by making our operations more efficient. Our ability to reduce staff, in order to improve efficiency and reduce our cost base is limited by: Greek labor laws; our long-standing practice of dismissing employees only "for cause;" and our desire to maintain good relations with our employees. As a result, we have depended, and will continue to depend, on hiring restrictions and attrition to achieve staff reductions. In 2004, the Bank made a total of 492 new hirings. During the year, 1,884 individuals retired from the Bank out of which 1,511 took advantage of an extended voluntary early retirement scheme. As a result, the total staff of the Bank was reduced by 1,392 employees (or 9.5% of the Bank's staff) in 2004. In an effort to further improve the efficiency of our international operations, we also reduced staff in our international subsidiaries by 161 employees during 2004. We will continue to assess whether we will be able to reduce our staff to levels that will contribute to improved profitability. Our delinquent loans in Greece are not considered non-performing until later than would be the case in the United States. Until January 1, 2002, the Bank ceased to accrue interest on residential mortgages in Greece when they were delinquent for 360 days. This period was reduced to 180 days following new rules enacted by Greek Law 2937/2001 that took effect from that date. In respect of commercial loans in Greece, we cease to accrue interest on such loans when they are delinquent for 180 days, and on consumer and credit card loans, when they are delinquent for 100 days (90 days' delinquency plus a 10-day grace period). In each case, this is longer than would be the case if such loans were extended in the United States where loans are generally considered non-performing if they are delinquent for 90 days. Non-performing loans have had a negative impact on our operations and may continue to do so. Non-performing loans continue to negatively impact our operating results, as they have in the past. Non-performing loans represented approximately 5.2% of our total loan portfolio as at December 31, 12 2004. Our level of non-performing loans is higher than that of many other banks in the EU. Key factors that have historically contributed to our high level of non-performing loans include: recession in the Greek economy, which affected many borrowers in the early 1990s; government influence over lending policies, including: government and central bank regulations requiring lending to specific sectors of the economy; requirements that the Bank extend loans to troubled companies considered to be important to the Greek national interest; over-reliance on borrowers' collateral, rather than cash flows, as a measure of creditworthiness for approving and monitoring loans; and inadequate procedures for monitoring troubled loans. Also, as a result of certain tax and legal considerations, non-performing loans generally remain on our balance sheet significantly longer than for other banks in the EU. To improve the overall quality of our loan portfolio, we have enhanced our methods of providing for losses inherent in our portfolio and increased the level of write-offs we take for non-performing loans. We began gradually introducing revised credit approval and monitoring procedures in 1998 to help improve the quality of our loan assets and mitigate against future non-performing loans. These new procedures focus on the borrower's cash flow and ability to repay. However, we cannot assure you that these credit approval and monitoring procedures will reduce the amount of loans that become non-performing in the future, or that these future non-performing loans will not have a material negative impact on our operating results in future periods. In addition, a downturn in the global economy is outside our control and would likely result in a higher proportion of non-performing loans. See Item 4.E, "Selected Statistical DataCredit QualityNon-Performing Loans, Loan Loss Provisions and Loan Loss Experience." Political and economic developments in Greece and abroad could adversely affect our operations. Our financial condition, results of operations and prospects as well as the market price and liquidity of the Bank's shares may be adversely affected by events outside our control, namely: changes in Greek government policy; EU Directives in the banking sector and other areas; political instability or military action affecting Europe and/or other areas abroad; and taxation and other political, economic or social developments in or affecting Greece and the Balkans. It is possible that events affecting us, especially in the various regions in which we operate or have significant investments, could occur, which are outside the control even of the Hellenic Republic. For example, our operations in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continue to be adversely affected by the political instability in the region and the resulting economic downturn. As at December 31, 2004, 36.7% of our loan portfolio in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, virtually all of which is held by our subsidiary Stopanska Banka is classified as non-performing and we have made provisions for approximately 26.7% of the total portfolio of Stopanska Banka. We cannot assure you that the percentage of non-performing loans in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the other jurisdictions in which we operate will not increase or that we will not be required to take further provisions for such loans in the future. In addition, the Romanian economy, where our subsidiary, Banca Romaneasca, operates, continues to show the characteristics of a developing economy. The banking industry in Romania is also highly influenced by fluctuations of the exchange rate of the ROL against other currencies and general economic conditions in Romania. 13 We cannot assure you that other such events and forces outside of our control in the jurisdictions in which we operate and/or invest will not similarly have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Exchange rate fluctuations could have a significant impact on the value of our shares. The market price of the Bank's shares traded on the Athens Exchange (which is referred to in this Annual Report as the "ATHEX") is denominated in euro. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and other currencies may affect the value of the Bank's shares or ADRs in the local currency of investors in the United States and other countries that have not adopted the euro as their currency. For example, although the Bank's ADRs are traded in U.S. dollars, the underlying shares are traded in euro and exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the U.S. dollar may affect the trading price of the Bank's ADRs. Additionally, cash dividends on the Bank's shares are paid in euro and, therefore, are subject to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to an investor's local currency, including U.S. dollars. The euro's value against the U.S. dollar increased by approximately 15.5% between its introduction on January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2004. Subsequently, the euro has depreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 10% to June 15, 2005. Weakness or volatility of the euro against other currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, could have a significant impact on the value of the Bank's shares. The ATHEX is less liquid than other major exchanges. The principal trading market for the Bank's shares is the ATHEX. The ATHEX is less liquid than major markets in Western Europe and the United States. As a result, shareholders may have difficulty assessing the past performance of the shares based on the Bank's prior trading record on the ATHEX. In 2004, average daily trading value on the ATHEX was approximately €141 million, while in the first six months of 2005 it was approximately €188.3 million. As at December 31, 2004, the aggregate market value of all shares listed on the ATHEX was approximately €92 billion. The market value of the Bank's shares listed on the ATHEX on that date was €8 billion, representing approximately 8.7% of the capitalization of all companies listed on the ATHEX. We cannot make assurances about the future liquidity of the market for the Bank's shares. Our share price has been, and may continue to be, volatile. The market price of the Bank's shares has been subject to volatility in the past, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; the condition of the Greek economy and the economies of the other countries that have adopted the euro as their currency pursuant to EMU; potential or actual sale of large numbers of the Bank's shares into the market; our competitors' positions in the market; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; conditions and trends in the banking sector in Greece and elsewhere in Europe; our earnings releases and the earnings releases of our competitors; and the general state of the securities markets (with particular emphasis on their Greek and financial services sectors). During the period from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2004, the ATHEX Composite Index increased by 23.1%. Additionally, during the period from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2005, the same index 14 increased by 9.8%. Investors may not be able to trade large amounts of shares during or following periods of volatility. Regulation of the Greek banking industry is changing. Regulation of the banking industry in Greece has changed in recent years pursuant to changes in Greek law, largely to comply with applicable EU directives. In addition, the Bank of Greece, the central bank in Greece, has in recent years introduced regulatory changes in the Greek banking sector. In January 1999, the Bank of Greece introduced new provisioning policies that require Greek banks to make specific provisions depending on the status and the type of a given loan and the number of days the loan has been in arrears. These provisioning policies were amended in January 2003 and January 2005 and generally require Greek banks, including the Bank, to increase their provisions for capital adequacy purposes. We cannot predict what regulatory changes may be imposed in the future, either as a result of regulatory initiatives in the European Union or by the Bank of Greece. If we are required to make additional provisions or increase our reserves, as may result from the proposed New Basle Capital Accord (discussed below) and other potential regulatory changes, this could adversely affect our results of operations. Our capital adequacy requirements may change as a result of the New Basle Capital Accord. In 1988, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision adopted capital guidelines (which are referred to in this Annual Report as the "Basle guidelines") based on the relationship between a bank's capital and its credit risks. The Basle guidelines have been implemented by banking regulators in most industrialized countries, including the Hellenic Republic. The Basle guidelines are intended to strengthen the soundness of the international banking system and reduce competitive inequality among international banks by harmonizing the definition of capital and the basis for the evaluation of asset risks and by establishing a uniform target capital adequacy ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. In 1996, the Basle Committee amended the 1988 Basle guidelines in order to address market risk, such as foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. In April 2003, the Basle Committee released its third consultative paper on the new capital adequacy standards in order to overhaul the existing regime, contemplating a "New Basle Capital Accord." The New Basle Capital Accord proposals currently include diverse methodologies for the calculation of capital requirements in respect of credit risk and the newly introduced operational risk (the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events). The New Basle Capital Accord was finalized by the Basle Committee in June 2004 and is expected to become effective in the various countries that participate in the Basle Committee at the end of 2006. If New Basle Capital Accord proposals are fully adopted by the European Union, the Bank may be required by its regulators to maintain higher levels of capital, which could decrease our operational flexibility and may increase our financing costs. Consequently, we cannot assure you that the New Basle Capital Accord will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future. Preemptive rights may not be available to U.S. holders of shares or ADRs. Under Greek law and our Articles of Association, prior to the issuance of any new shares, we must offer holders of our existing shares preemptive rights to subscribe and pay for a sufficient number of shares to maintain their existing ownership percentages. These preemptive rights are generally transferrable during the subscription period for the related offering and may be quoted on the ATHEX. U.S. holders of shares or ADRs may not be able to receive (and trade) or exercise preemptive rights for new shares or for shares underlying ADRs unless a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (which is referred to in this Annual Report as the "Securities Act") is effective with respect to such rights or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. Our decision to file a registration statement with respect to these shares or ADRs will depend on the costs 15 and potential liabilities associated with any such registration statement, as well as the perceived benefits of enabling U.S. holders of shares and ADRs to exercise their preemptive rights and any other factors we may consider appropriate at the time. If U.S. holders of shares or ADRs are not able to receive (and trade) or exercise preemptive rights granted in respect of their shares or the shares represented by their ADRs in any rights offering by us then they might not receive the economic benefit of such rights. In addition, their proportional ownership interests in NBG will be diluted.
