Risk Factors An investment in our securities involves a number of risk and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the cautionary statement under the caption “SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995” in Item 7 of this report and the other information included in this report, before purchasing our securities. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Interest Rates The U. S. Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates at 14 consecutive meetings and, while hinting the tightening cycle is about over, has not clearly specified at what rate it plans to stop. Overall economic growth has slowed; however, business investment and manufacturing continue to perform strongly. Should the Fed decide to continue with several more rate increases, prospects for business investment and manufacturing could deteriorate sufficiently to impact sales opportunities. In the Eurozone, any additional interest rate increases there could halt an economic recovery that just started in the last half of 2005, jeopardizing a modest improvement in sales. Production Capacity The ongoing recovery in the world economy, as well as in Caterpillar sales, has extensively used available productive capacity in many industries and stressed the world's transportation system. Our forecast for 2006 assumes continued good world economic growth, as well as another increase in our sales. As a result, capacity in a number of industries could become even tighter and more vulnerable to disruptions, such as labor disagreements, weather or lack of raw materials. Such disruptions could result in material cost spikes, disruptions in production, or increased inefficiencies, all of which would impair our ability to efficiently meet customer demand. Metal and Energy Prices The increase in metals and energy prices since 2002 has significantly boosted demand for machines and engines. Factors causing higher prices, tight supplies and growing demand, are expected to remain in place in 2006. However, metals and energy prices are volatile and a sudden drop in demand, perhaps resulting from weaker economic growth, could cause a collapse in prices. Such an event would weaken economic growth in many developing countries and reduce investments in new production capacity for metals and energy. Item 1B.
