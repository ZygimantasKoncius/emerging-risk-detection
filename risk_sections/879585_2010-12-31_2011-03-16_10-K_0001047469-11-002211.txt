ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Report, you should carefully consider the risks described below that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. These risks are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Risks relating to our U.S. operations If we have difficulties integrating our newly acquired U.S. retail wireless business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our Alltel Acquisition is the largest and most significant acquisition we have undertaken. As part of that, we have established a headquarters for this business in Little Rock, Arkansas, recruited a management team to operate the wireless assets as a stand-alone business, and added approximately 800 employees that work at our headquarters and in the acquired service markets, many of whom are former employees of Alltel Corporation. We have devoted and will continue to devote a significant amount of time and attention to integrating these operations with our existing U.S. wireless network and technical operations team and transitioning all systems and processes to our own, most of which we must put in place prior to the completion of the transition. Among the challenges we face in doing so are (1) the need to integrate a large number of new employees, (2) the need to separate our acquired network from the legacy Alltel network and transition or "re-home" some of the acquired field network facilities to newly built, or other newly acquired, switching and other core network facilities and (3) integrating and aligning numerous business and work processes, including customer billing, by building and designing our own processes and the information systems necessary to track and handle those processes. The integration process poses challenges not found in many acquisitions because of the fact that we have acquired assets and customers that were part of a much larger organization and we need to operate those assets on a much smaller scale and design systems and processes with that in mind. We are currently dependent on transition services provided by Verizon Wireless for the operation of the Alltel assets, including critical billing and information technology systems and customer services. We currently expect these transition services to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Significant unexpected difficulties in transitioning billing, inventory, point-of-sale systems or other systems could materially and negatively impact our customers' experience leading to widespread dissatisfaction, higher rates of customer churn, unsatisfactory employee relations, increased expense and reduced collected revenue. If any of the above events were to occur or if we have other difficulties with the transition process, it could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Intense competition in the U.S. retail wireless industry and our smaller scale, relative to larger national or regional wireless carriers, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Competition in the U.S. retail wireless industry is currently intense and could intensify further in the future due to the general effects of a weak economy, as well as due to wireless industry factors such as increased market saturation and aggressive price reductions. Our main competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are much larger than us. These carriers possess greater resources and much greater economies of scale that gives them a significant cost advantage in many areas. The national carriers can deploy new network technologies and mobile handsets and devices more rapidly and at a lower cost. The national and larger regional carriers typically also have broader radio spectrum holdings, giving them the ability to launch multiple technologies and to devote more 20 Table of Contents bandwidth to a given voice or data service. Due to our smaller scale, we may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources, which could adversely affect our revenues and costs of doing business. In particular, our business depends on our access to new handsets and other devices and to a lesser extent, content for data, music or video services, being developed by vendors. Because of their buying power and the relationships they have created with vendors, the large national carriers have a significant advantage in pushing the development of new technologies and taking advantage of those technologies. For example, in the past, they have entered into deals with device vendors giving them the exclusive right to sell the latest mobile devices for a period of time. If we are unable to obtain new handsets being developed by vendors at favorable pricing and quantities as a result of our smaller purchasing resources or obtain timely access to content for data, music or video services, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Due to the non-contiguous nature of our newly acquired U.S. wireless network, if we are unable to expand our network and obtain the roaming services we need from other carriers to operate competitively, our profitability and other results of operations could be adversely affected. The wireless assets that we acquired were historically operated as part of a national network whose customers valued nationwide coverage and support. As a result of the regulatory-required divestiture of these assets, many of our retail markets are now non-contiguous, are currently undergoing a separation from the legacy Alltel network and are anticipated to require network expansion, improvements and roaming support to ensure ongoing nationwide coverage. We believe nationwide coverage remains important to a large portion of our customer base. Many of our competitors have regional or national networks that enable them to offer automatic roaming services to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer. We currently have roaming agreements in place with several larger carriers, including Verizon Wireless, our main competitor, and expect to enter into additional roaming agreements with other carriers. This enables us to offer our customers competitively priced regional and international rate plans that include areas for which we do not own wireless licenses. We expect that we will be highly dependent on the roaming services we use from a mix of our competitors and other carriers. If we are unable to obtain or maintain roaming agreements with other wireless carriers that contain pricing and other terms that are competitive and acceptable to us and that satisfy our quality and interoperability requirements, we may no longer be able to offer these regional and international rate plans and the coverage area and pricing we offer to our customers may not be as attractive relative to the offers from our competitors and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Our customers are also accustomed to seamless handoffs between wireless markets as they travel, particularly in former Alltel markets that we did not acquire and where we are now dependent on roaming support. Any failure to recreate these seamless handoff points while successfully building out and enhancing our U.S. wireless network and necessary support facilities and systems in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies customer expectations for quality and coverage, could have an adverse effect on our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Any difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay expansion of operations and product capabilities in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. 21 Table of Contents If we experience a high rate of wireless customer turnover, our revenues could decline and its costs could increase. Many wireless providers in the U.S. have experienced and have sought to prevent a high rate of customer turnover. We expect that the transition away from Alltel's much larger, nearly nationwide network to our smaller regional network could cause increased customer turnover, especially within the first year or two of our operations. Increased customer turnover may occur as a result of many different factors, including problems with our ongoing transition, limited network coverage, reliability issues such as blocked or dropped calls, handset performance and availability issues, price competition for service plans or handset devices, customer care problems such as billing errors or poor customer service, aggressive marketing campaigns by competitors and other competitive factors. In addition, customers could elect to switch to another carrier that has service offerings utilizing a newer network technology. We cannot assure you that our strategies to address customer turnover will be successful. If we experience a high rate of wireless customer turnover or seek to prevent significant customer turnover or fail to replace lost customers, our revenues could decline and our costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry may adversely affect us. We face rapid and significant changes in technology. In particular, the telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological changes, including the following: evolving industry standards; the allocation of new radio frequency spectrum in which to license and operate advanced wireless services; ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology and shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements; changes in end-user requirements and preferences; the development and adoption of VoIP telephony services; convergence between video and data services; development of data and broadband capabilities; and migration to next-generation services, including the deployment of LTE or "4G" network technology, which may require the purchase of additional spectrum. For us to keep up with these technological changes and remain competitive, at a minimum we will be required to continue to make significant capital expenditures. Our retail wireless customers have an increased demand for data services and our value to our wholesale wireless customers depends in part on our network's ability to support the services that such carriers' customers demand. For example, advanced mobile high-speed wireless data services, which allow customers to use the wireless network to send and receive data files and access the Internet at speeds approaching fixed broadband, have become increasingly popular. As demand for advanced mobile data services continues to grow, we may have difficulty satisfying our retail customers and those of our wholesale roaming partners without substantial upgrades, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. New technologies may be protected by patents or other intellectual property laws and therefore may not be available to us. Also, alternative technologies may be developed that provide communications services or alternative services superior to those available from us. Rapid changes in technology in our market may adversely affect our business. For example, to accommodate the demand by our wholesale wireless customers for next-generation advanced wireless products such as high-speed data and streaming video, we may be 22 Table of Contents required to purchase additional spectrum. In addition, usage of wireless voice or broadband services in excess of our expectations could cause service disruptions and result in higher operating costs and capital expenditures to address capacity needs. In each of our markets, providing more and higher speed data services through our wireless or wireline networks may require us to make substantial investments in additional telecommunications transport capacity connecting our networks to the Internet, and in some cases such capacity may not be available to us or be available on attractive terms. We cannot assure you that we will gain access to spectrum or capacity at a reasonable cost or at all. Failure to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with carriers offering these new technologies in our markets. We rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of handsets, accessories, equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure. If these suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors, we could fail to obtain sufficient quantities of the products and services we require to operate our businesses successfully. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our handset lineup, network infrastructure and our back-office IT systems infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering these network components on a timely basis, our subscriber or revenue growth and operating results could suffer significantly. We source wireless devices from a small number of equipment manufacturers and depend on access to compelling devices at reasonable prices as well as timely delivery of devices to meet market demands. The inability to provide a competitive device lineup, as discussed with respect to increased competition risks above, could materially impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. We are also reliant upon a limited number of network equipment manufacturers, including Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia in the United States. If it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement suppliers or vendors on economically attractive terms on a timely basis. Our network capacity and customer service systems may not be adequate and may not expand quickly enough to support our customer growth. Our financial and operational success depends on ensuring that we have adequate network capacity to accommodate anticipated new customers and the related increase in usage of our network. This includes capacity on our wireless and wireline networks and capacity on our inter- and intra-network transport facilities. Our failure to expand and upgrade our networks and transport facilities to meet the increased usage could impair our quality of service, cause a decline in customer satisfaction and have a material adverse effect on our business. Our retail wireless network capacity plans generally rely on the following: the ability to obtain and construct additional cell sites and other infrastructure equipment; the ability to secure adequate transport capacity between our cell sites and our network switching and routing platforms and between those platforms and the Internet and other carriers. the ability to obtain additional spectrum if required; and the ability to obtain the capital to expand and upgrade our network. 23 Table of Contents In addition, we must implement, manage and monitor effective procedures for customer activation, customer service, billing and other support services. Reliance on our customer service and handset procurement functions increases as we add new customers and offer new services and pricing plans. Our failure to timely and efficiently meet the demands for these services could decrease or slow subscriber growth or delay or otherwise impede billing and collection of amounts owed, which would adversely affect our revenue. We cannot make assurances that our customer service systems and network capacity will expand and adapt quickly enough to keep up with our anticipated customer growth and changes in services, and failure to do so would impair our ability to compete, which would adversely affect our results and financial operations. Our wireless and wireline revenues depend on the reliability and performance of our network infrastructure. We must operate our wireless and wireline networks so as to minimize any disruption that may occur to our services. The ongoing transition of our U.S. retail wireless business, especially with respect to the separation of our acquired network from the legacy Alltel network and conversion of legacy Alltel information and technology systems and platforms to our own, creates a great risk of disruption to our services. In addition, the continued operation and growth of our networks and the implementation of new technologies and services involve operating risks that may disrupt our services and cause losses in revenue. Other risks that may also cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers include power loss, capacity limitations, software defects and breaches of security by computer viruses, break-ins or otherwise. Disruptions in our networks and the unavailability of our services could lead to a loss of customers, damage to our reputation and violation of the terms of our licenses and contracts with customers. These failures could also lead to significant negative publicity, regulatory problems and litigation. A significant portion of our U.S. wholesale wireless revenue is derived from a small number of customers that could build or acquire overlapping networks. Our U.S. wholesale wireless business, which accounted for approximately 26% of our consolidated revenue in 2010, generates a substantial majority of its revenues from three national wireless service providers. In 2010, four national wireless service providers together accounted for substantially all of the wholesale wireless portion of revenue. Our relationships with our roaming customers generally are much more financially significant for us than for our customers, which can give our customers significant leverage in negotiating pricing and other terms. If our markets are not included in our roaming partners' home calling areas and are instead subject to the imposition of additional roaming charges, we could see a loss of roaming minutes and revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we fail to keep any of our roaming customers satisfied with our service offerings or economic terms and lose their business or are unable to renew or enter into new agreements with these customers on beneficial terms (including pricing) to us, we could suffer a substantial loss of revenue, which would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if these customers build or acquire wireless networks in our service areas we may lose revenue and scale. Should any of these customers take such actions over a significant portion of the areas we serve, it may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, the acquisition by Verizon Wireless of Alltel Corporation assets, and subsequent acquisition of Alltel assets by AT&T, has already resulted in each of AT&T and Verizon gaining their own infrastructure in markets where they were formerly served by us. This is expected to continue to result in a significant loss of revenue and operating income in future periods, which, if not offset by growth in other revenues we generate, could materially reduce overall operating profits. 24 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Wireless and Wireline Services in Guyana Our exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in Guyana is subject to significant political and regulatory risk. Since 1991, our subsidiary Guyana Telephone and Telegraph, Ltd. ("GT&T") has operated in Guyana pursuant to a license from the Government of Guyana to be the exclusive provider of domestic fixed and international voice and data services pursuant to a license with an initial term ending in December 2010, which is renewable at our sole option for an additional 20 year term. In November 2009, we notified the Government of Guyana of our election to renew our exclusive license for an additional 20 years. Since 2001, the Government of Guyana has stated its intention to introduce additional competition into Guyana's telecommunications sector. Since that time, we have met on several occasions with the Government of Guyana to discuss potential modifications of our exclusivity and other rights under the existing agreement. In early October 2010, the Government of Guyana released to existing telecommunications providers in Guyana certain materials, including drafts of legislation, regulations, and licenses ("Draft Laws"), that, if enacted, would permit other telecommunications carriers to receive licenses to provide domestic fixed services and international voice and data services in Guyana, in contravention of our existing exclusive license. The Draft Laws would also introduce material changes to many other features of Guyana's existing telecommunications regulatory regime. In exercising our option to renew our licenses in 2009, we reiterated to the Government that we would be willing to voluntarily relinquish the exclusivity aspect of our licenses, but only as part of an overall settlement agreement with the Government. At this time, we do not know when or if the Draft Laws will be adopted by the Government of Guyana, or if changes will be made to the substance of the Draft Laws, including the termination of our exclusivity rights. Although we believe that we would be entitled to damages or other compensation for any involuntary termination of the exclusive license, we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in a proceeding to enforce our rights or that our actions would effectively halt any unilateral action by the Government. On December 15, 2010, we received correspondence from the Government of Guyana indicating that our licenses had been renewed until such time that new legislation is in place with regard to the Government's intention to liberalize the sector; however, we believe our exclusive license to be valid until such time as we enter into a negotiated settlement with the Government. See "BusinessRegulation of Our GT&T Subsidiary." We are dependent on GT&T for a significant, although much diminished, portion of our revenues and profits. A loss of exclusivity on international voice and data service would result in a reduction in the international call traffic that we handle and could also result in a decline in international calling rates and termination fees. Any modification, early termination or other revocation of the exclusive domestic fixed and international voice and data license could adversely affect a substantial portion of our revenues and profits and diminish the value of our investment in Guyana. Any significant decline in the price or volume, including as a result of bypass activities, of international long distance calls to Guyana could adversely affect our financial results. We collect payments from foreign carriers for handling international long distance calls originating from the foreign carriers' countries and ending in Guyana. The payments, which are based on volume and payment rates, are pursuant to arrangements we have with the foreign carriers and are subject to the actions of telecommunications regulators, such as the U.S. FCC. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our revenues from our inbound and outbound international long distance services in Guyana were $27.9 million (or 5% of our consolidated revenue for 2010). More than half of these revenues and profits were from collecting payments for international long distance calls into Guyana from other countries. 25 Table of Contents Any decrease in the payment rate or the volume of inbound long distance calls would reduce the amount of the payments we collect. We believe the volume of international long distance voice traffic is increasingly being threatened by customers and illegal operators bypassing our international exchange through various means, including sending voice traffic as Voice over Internet Protocol (or VoIP). In 2008 and through 2010, this activitywhether by known carriers or small "black market" operatorsincreased significantly. Further reductions in the payment rates or a decline in inbound international long distance volume, through VoIP, competition or otherwise, would adversely affect our revenues and profits, and would deprive us of a critical source of U.S. currency as payments from foreign carriers to GT&T are in U.S. dollars. Other Risks Relating to Our Businesses and Industry The loss of certain licenses would adversely affect our ability to provide wireless and broadband services. In the United States, wireless, PCS and microwave licenses are valid for ten years from the effective date of the license. Licensees may renew their licenses for additional ten-year periods by filing renewal applications with the FCC. Our wireless licenses in the U.S. expire between 2011 and 2020. The renewal applications are subject to FCC review and are put out for public comment to ensure that the licensees meet their licensing requirements and comply with other applicable FCC mandates. Failure to file for renewal of these licenses or failure to meet any licensing requirements could lead to a denial of the renewal application and thus adversely affect our ability to continue to provide service in that license area. Furthermore, our compliance with regulatory requirements such as enhanced 911 and CALEA requirements may depend on the availability of necessary equipment or software. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may have an adverse effect on our licenses or operations and could result in sanctions, fines or other penalties. Regulatory changes may impose restrictions that adversely affect us or cause us to incur significant unplanned costs in modifying our business plans or operations. We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local regulations and foreign government regulations, all of which are subject to change. As new telecommunications laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our business plans or operations. We cannot be certain that we can do so in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate, the assessment of penalties or fines or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Our operations in the United States are subject to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (or 1996 Act). The interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the 1996 Act and the FCC rules implementing the 1996 Act continue to be heavily debated and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, although legislation has not yet been introduced, there have been indications that Congress may substantially revise the 1996 Act and other regulation in the next few years. In particular, the FCC is currently considering long-term Universal Service Fund ("USF") reform and has recommended, among other things, to cap universal service support for all competitive eligible telecommunications carriers and change the way USF support is disbursed to program recipients. It is not possible to predict whether or when any of proposed reforms will be adopted, however, implementation of some of the proposals could significantly affect the amount of USF support the Company receives and could have an adverse effect on our business. While we believe we are in compliance with federal and state regulatory requirements, our interpretation of our obligations may differ from those of regulatory authorities. Both federal and state regulators require us to pay various fees and assessments, file periodic reports and comply with various rules regarding our consumer marketing practices and the contents of our bills, on an on-going basis. If 26 Table of Contents we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to fines or potentially be asked to show cause as to why our certificate of authority to provide service should not be revoked. Increased competition may adversely affect growth, require increased capital expenditures, result in the loss of existing customers and decrease our revenues. We face competition in the markets in which we operate. For example: In the United States, we compete with national and regional retail wireless providers that offer both prepaid and postpaid services whose scale, resources and U.S. network footprint are generally significantly greater than ours. If we cannot continue to provide competitive pricing or updated mobile voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements or the expansion of our own network, we could experience increased churn, net subscriber reductions or reduced revenue in our U.S. retail wireless business. The greatest competitive risk to our wholesale roaming business is the possibility that its current customers may elect to build or enhance their own networks within the rural market in which we currently provide service, which is commonly known as "over-building." If our roaming customers, which generally have greater financial resources and access to capital than we do, determine to over-build, their need for our roaming services will be significantly reduced or eliminated. In Guyana, we have faced competition from Digicel, a wireless service provider operating across the region that has been very aggressive in acquiring a substantial share of the market. In Bermuda and Turks and Caicos, we compete with the incumbent wireless service provider and Digicel, as well. In New England and New York State, in addition to other competitive voice and data communications service providers, we compete with much larger regional carriers, each of which has greater financial and other resources. Over the last several years, an increase in competition has contributed to a decline in prices for communication services, including local and long distance telephone service, data services and mobile wireless services. Increased competition may decrease prices further. In addition, increased competition could reduce our customer base, require us to invest in new facilities and capabilities and reduce revenues, margins and returns. Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position. Our operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean may face adverse financial consequences and operational problems due to foreign political or economic changes, such as changes in national or regional political or economic conditions, or laws and regulations that restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds. In addition, we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Any of these changes could adversely affect our revenues or financial position. If we lose our senior management, our business may be adversely affected; we rely on local management to run our operating units. The success of our business is largely dependent on our executive officers and the officers of our operating units, as well as on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified technical and management personnel. We believe that there is, and will continue to be, strong competition for qualified personnel in the communications industry and in our markets, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. The 27 Table of Contents loss of key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently maintain "key person" life insurance on any of our key employees and none of the executives at our parent company are under employment agreements. We rely heavily on local management to run our operating units. Many of the markets we operate in are small and somewhat isolated and therefore it is particularly difficult attracting and retaining talented and qualified managers and staff in those markets. A global economic recession, or difficult and volatile conditions in the capital and credit markets, could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. Our operations and performance depend on general economic conditions. The global economy could continue to experience an economic downturn due to the crisis in credit markets, slower economic activity, increased unemployment, concerns about inflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence and other adverse business conditions. Such fluctuations in the global economy could cause, among other things, deterioration and continued decline in spending and increase in the cost of labor and materials. As a result, our operating results could be materially impacted. An economic recession could have a significant adverse impact on consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending, which may result in decreased sales and earnings for us. For example, among other things: A decrease in tourism could negatively affect revenues and growth opportunities from operations in the islands and in a number of areas covered by U.S. rural wireless operations that serve tourist destinations. We rely on the population of Guyanese living abroad who initiate calls to Guyana or are responsible for remittances to relatives living in Guyana. A prolonged economic downturn in the U.S. or Canadian economies could continue to affect inbound calling and, therefore, our revenue in Guyana. The impact, if any, that these financial market events, or any governmental actions intended to address these events, might have on us and our business is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. The occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes may materially disrupt our operations. Many of the areas in which we operate, which have experienced severe weather conditions over the years including hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, damaging storms and floods. Some areas in which we operate may also be at risk of earthquakes. Such events may materially disrupt and adversely affect our business operations. A major hurricane passed directly over Bermuda in 2003 causing major damage to our network and to the island's infrastructure. In 2008, a hurricane caused extensive damage on a small portion of the U.S. Virgin Islands and a separate hurricane negatively affected operations in the Turks and Caicos. Guyana has suffered from severe rains and flooding in two of the last five years. While these events have not had a significant negative impact on the operating results or financial condition of the affected businesses or our overall business, we cannot assure you that these types of events will not have such an impact in the future or that the insurance coverage we maintain for these risks will adequately compensate us for all damage and economic losses resulting from natural catastrophes. 28 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Capital Structure Our debt instruments include restrictive and financial covenants that limit our operating flexibility. Our credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe such actions are in our best interest. These include restrictions on our ability to do the following: incur additional debt; create liens or negative pledges with respect to our assets; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock; make investments, loans or advances or other forms of payments; issue, sell or allow distributions on capital stock of specified subsidiaries; enter into transactions with affiliates; or merge, consolidate or sell our assets. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facility or any subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default. Such default may allow our creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, these creditors may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds. If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the credit facility, the lenders could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets. In connection with the incurrence of the indebtedness under the credit facility, the lenders received a pledge of our share of the capital stock of all of our subsidiaries, and that of future direct and indirect subsidiaries with some limited exceptions. Additionally, the lenders under our credit facility generally have a lien on all of our U.S. assets and certain of our non-U.S. assets. As a result of these pledges and liens, if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the credit facility (including meeting or exceeding certain financial measurements), the lenders would be entitled to foreclose on and liquidate substantially all of our assets, to the extent required to pay our obligations under the credit facility. As a result, the holders of our securities may lose a portion of, or the entire value of, their investment in our securities. Our Chairman is our largest stockholder and will continue to exert significant influence over us. Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., our Chairman and the father of our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns, together with related entities and affiliates approximately 36% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he is able to exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions. In addition, as our Chairman, he has and will continue to have significant influence over other matters brought before our Board of Directors, such as proposed changes in our strategy or business plans and our major financing decisions. His interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. 29 Table of Contents Low trading volume of our stock may limit our shareholders ability to sell shares and/or result in lower sale prices. During the first quarter of 2011 through March 1, 2011, the average daily trading volume of our common stock was approximately 95,000 shares. As a result, shareholders may have difficulty selling a large number of shares of our common stock in the manner or at a price that might be attainable if our common stock were more actively traded. In addition, the market price of our common stock may not be reflective of its underlying value. We may not pay dividends in the future. Our stockholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if, and when, they are declared by our Board of Directors. We have paid quarterly dividends in the past, but may cease to do so at any time. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, our capital stock. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that may further restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends. We may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable state laws, our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, covenants contained in our financing agreements, management's assessment of future capital needs and other factors considered by our Board of Directors.
