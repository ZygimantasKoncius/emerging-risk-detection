Item 1A. Risk FactorsIn the normal course of business, our operations, financial condition and results of operations are routinely subjected to a variety of risks. Our actual financial results could differ materially from projected results due to some or all of the factors discussed below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as those discussed in the “Competition,” “Our Stores,” “Distribution,” and “Government Regulation” sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, current global economic conditions may amplify many of these risks.A decline in consumer spending, change in consumer preferences, or failure to successfully manage and execute our marketing initiatives could reduce our sales or profitability and harm our business.Our sales depend on consumer spending, which is influenced by factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the availability of discretionary income and credit, consumer confidence, tax or interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, healthcare costs, weather, and unemployment levels. Global or national political unrest or uncertainty may also impact the price paid by consumers for goods, services and commodities and reduce consumer spending and confidence, and reduce our sales or profitability. We may experience declines in sales or changes in the types of products sold during economic downturns. Any material decline in the amount of consumer spending could reduce our sales, and a decrease in the sales of higher-margin products could reduce profitability and, in each case, harm our business. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences, and thereby cultivate a growing, loyal customer base, improve customer traffic, and increase the average transaction amount. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, and spending patterns, as well as pet ownership trends and pet care needs could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our business depends in part on the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives. We may not be able to successfully execute such initiatives to realize the intended benefits and growth prospects due to factors outside of our control, such as increased competition or deterioration of general economic conditions, thus limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and expand our business. Also, if we are unable to accurately predict our customers' preferred method of communication or their acceptance of our marketing initiatives, we could fail to drive sales growth, thereby impacting our business and financial performance.The pet products and services retail industry is very competitive and continued competitive forces may adversely impact our business and financial results.The pet products and services retail industry is very competitive. We compete with supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and other mass and general retail merchandisers, many of which are larger and have significantly greater resources than we have. We also compete with a number of specialty pet supply stores and independent pet stores, veterinarians, catalog retailers, and e-commerce retailers. The pet products and services retail industry has become increasingly competitive due to the expansion of pet-related product offerings by certain supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and other mass and retail merchandisers, and the entrance of other specialty retailers into the pet food and pet supply market, some of which have developed store formats similar to ours. We may face greater competition from these or other retailers in the future, and changes in their merchandising and operational strategies could impact our sales and profitability. In particular, if supermarket, warehouse club, or other mass and retail merchandise competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we would likely reduce our prices on similar product offerings in order to remain competitive, which may result in a decrease in our market share, sales, operating results, and profitability and require a change in our operating strategies.We also have been able to compete successfully by differentiating ourselves from our competitors through providing a careful combination of product assortment, competitive pricing, service offerings, and unique customer experience. If changes in consumer preferences decrease the competitive advantage attributable to these factors, or if we fail to otherwise positively differentiate our customer experience from our competitors, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.8Table of ContentsWe may be unable to continue to open new stores and enter new markets successfully. If we are unable to successfully reformat existing stores and open new stores, our results of operations could be harmed, and comparable store sales at our existing stores may decrease due to age or the impact of opening new stores in the same area, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Also, store development may place increasing demands on management and operating systems and may erode sales at existing stores.We currently operate stores in most of the major market areas of the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Our ability to be successful with our store development efforts is dependent on various factors, some of which are outside our control, including: •Identifying store sites that offer attractive returns on our investment notwithstanding the impact of cannibalization of our existing stores;•Competition for those sites; •Successfully negotiating with landlords to achieve acceptable lease terms and obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory, or private approvals;•Timely construction of stores; •Our ability to attract and retain qualified store personnel; and•Our ability to reformat existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our investment.To the extent we are unable to accomplish any of the above, our ability to open new stores and hotels or reformat existing ones may be harmed and our future sales and profits may be adversely affected. In addition, we can make no assurances that we will be able to meet the forecasted level of sales or operate our new stores or PetsHotels profitably.As a result of new store openings in existing markets, and because older stores will represent an increasing proportion of our store base over time, our comparable store sales performance may be materially impacted in future periods. In addition, opening new stores in a market will attract some customers away from other stores already operated by us in that market and diminish their sales.Our store development plans place increased demands on existing systems, procedures, and management and could result in operational inefficiencies and less effective management of our business and associates, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance. An increase in construction costs and/or building material costs could also adversely affect our financial performance.Our leases are typically signed approximately nine months before a store opens. As a result, we may be unable to timely adjust our store opening schedule to new economic conditions or a change in strategy.Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to seasonal changes associated with the pet products and services retail industry and the timing of expenses, new store openings, and store closures.Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. We typically realize a higher portion of net sales and operating profits during our fourth quarter, as compared to our other quarters, due to increased holiday traffic. As a result of this seasonality, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area, sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions, which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year. As a result of our expansion plans, the timing of new store and PetsHotel openings and related preopening costs, the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and PetsHotels, and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate. Controllable expenses could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter in a year. Finally, because new stores tend to experience higher payroll, advertising, and other store-level expenses as a percentage of net sales than mature stores, new store openings also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established.9Table of ContentsA disruption, malfunction, or increased costs in the operation, expansion, or replenishment of our distribution centers or our supply chain could impact our ability to manage our inventory, deliver products to our stores, or increase our expenses, which could harm our sales and results of operations.Our vendors generally ship merchandise to our distribution centers, which then allocate the merchandise to our stores. Any interruption or malfunction in our distribution operations, including, but not limited to, disruptions to the transportation infrastructure, disruptions caused by weather, catastrophic events, disease, contamination, or trade barriers, the loss of a key vendor that provides transportation of merchandise to or from our distribution centers, the failure of a key vendor to deliver on its commitments, or a material increase in our transportation and distribution costs, including, but not limited to, costs resulting from increases in the price of fuel and other energy costs or other commodities, could harm our sales and results of operations. We seek to optimize inventory levels to operate our business successfully. Nonetheless, we are exposed to inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, vendor reliability, changes in customer preferences or demand, and changes in consumer spending patterns with respect to our products. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid over or under stocking products that we sell. Demand for products, however, can change between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale and we may be unable to accurately forecast such changes. Any of the events above could result in out-of-stock or excess merchandise inventory levels that could harm our sales and the results of operations. We operate five fish distribution centers and have one fish distribution center that is operated by a third-party vendor. An interruption or malfunction in these operations or in the fulfillment of fish orders could harm our sales and results of operations. Operating the fish distribution centers is a very complex process, and if we lose the third-party operator, we can make no assurances that we could contract with another third party to operate the fish distribution center on favorable terms, if at all, or that we could successfully operate all of the fish distribution centers ourselves. In addition, our growth plans require the development of new distribution centers to service the increasing number of stores. If we are unable to successfully expand our distribution network in a timely manner, our sales or results of operations could be harmed. If our information systems fail to perform as designed or are interrupted for a significant period of time, our business could be harmed.The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. In particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage our financial and operational data, process payroll, manage the supply chain, and maintain our in-stock positions. We possess disaster recovery capabilities for our key information systems, and take measures intended to prevent security breaches and computer viruses. However, the failure of our information systems to perform as designed, due to failure to manage disasters, security breaches, computer viruses or any other interruption of our information systems for a significant period of time could disrupt our business.We continue to invest in our information systems. Enhancing or replacing our major financial or operational information systems could result in disruption of normal operating processes and procedures and have a significant impact on our ability to conduct our core business operations. We can make no assurances that enhancing or replacing our information systems will remain within estimated costs, that the systems will be implemented without material disruption, or that the systems will be as beneficial as predicted. If our predictions or estimates are inaccurate, the results of our operations could be harmed.If we fail to protect the integrity and security of customer and associate information, our business could be adversely impacted.The increasing costs associated with implementation and on-going operation of our information security systems, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy and information security laws, and costs resulting from potential data loss, could adversely impact our business. We also routinely possess sensitive customer and associate information, and, while we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information from security breaches, data loss, and computer viruses, if our security procedures and controls were compromised, unintentionally or through cyber-attacks, it could harm our business, consumer confidence, reputation, operating results, and financial condition, result in litigation, and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches.The disruption of the relationship with or the loss of any of our key vendors, including our vendors with whom we have exclusive relationships, a decision by our vendors to make their products available in supermarkets or through warehouse clubs and other mass and retail merchandisers, the inability of our vendors to provide quality products in a timely or cost-effective manner, the availability of generic products, or risks associated with the suppliers from whom products are sourced, could harm our business.Sales of natural pet food for dogs and cats comprise a significant portion of our net sales. Currently, most major vendors of natural pet food do not permit their products to be sold in supermarkets, warehouse clubs, or through other mass and retail merchandisers. If any natural pet food or pet supply vendor were to make its products available in supermarkets, warehouse clubs 10Table of Contentsand other mass or retail merchandisers, our business could be harmed. In addition, if the grocery brands currently available to such retailers were to gain market share at the expense of the natural brands sold only through specialty pet food and pet supply outlets, our business could be harmed.We purchase a substantial amount of pet supplies from a number of vendors with limited supply capabilities, and two of our largest vendors account for a material amount of products sold. We can make no assurances that we will be able to find new qualified vendors who meet our standards, or that our current pet supply vendors will be able to accommodate our anticipated needs or comply with new or existing regulatory requirements. In addition, we purchase a substantial amount of pet supplies from vendors outside of the United States. Effective global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We can make no assurances that our international vendors will be able to satisfy our requirements including, but not limited to, timeliness of delivery, acceptable product quality, and accurate packaging and labeling. Any inability of our existing vendors to provide products meeting such requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner could harm our business. While we believe we have good relationships with our vendors, we have no material long-term supply commitments from our vendors and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time. Many factors relating to our vendors and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control, including the stability of their political, economic, and financial environments, their abilities to operate in challenging economic environments or meet our standards and applicable United States and local legal requirements, the availability of labor and raw materials, labor unrest, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, trade restrictions, transport availability and cost, inflation, and other factors. In addition, Canadian and United States foreign trade policies, tariffs, and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, limitations on the import of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries, and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These factors affecting our vendors and our access to products could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Our expanded offering of proprietary-branded products may not improve our financial performance and may expose us to product liability claims.We offer various proprietary-branded products, for which we rely on third-party manufacturers. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, or the quality of the products may not meet our expectations. In such events, we may have increased exposure for quality-related claims or losses caused by such products. In addition, our proprietary-branded products compete with other manufacturers' branded items that we offer. As we continue to evaluate the number and types of proprietary-branded products that we sell, we may adversely affect our relationships with our vendors, who may decide to reduce their product offerings through us and increase their product offerings through our competitors. An increase in our proprietary-branded product offerings also exposes us to risk that third parties will assert infringement claims against us with respect to such products, and we may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights on our proprietary-branded products. Finally, if any of our customers are harmed by our proprietary-branded products, they may bring product liability and other claims against us. Any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.Food safety, quality, and health concerns could affect our business.We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of vendor-supplied food products and hardgood products. All of our vendors are required to comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent upon them to ensure such compliance. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether valid or not, may discourage consumers from buying the products in our stores, or cause vendor production and delivery disruptions. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in product liability claims against our vendors or us, expose us or our vendors to governmental enforcement action or private litigation, or lead to costly recalls and a loss of consumer confidence, any of which could have an adverse effect on our sales, operations, and financial performance.Our inability to attract, train, and retain qualified leaders and associates could harm our business.Our success is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train, manage, and retain a strong management team and quality store and distribution center associates, including skilled store managers and qualified services personnel such as pet trainers and groomers. There is a high level of competition for these employees and our ability to operate our stores and expand our services depends on our ability to attract and retain these personnel. Competition for qualified store management and services personnel could require us to pay higher wages or other compensation to attract a sufficient number of employees. Turnover, which has historically been high among entry-level or part-time associates at our stores and distribution centers, increases the risk that associates will not have the training and experience needed to provide competitive, high-quality customer service. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, and changes in employment legislation. If we are unable to retain qualified associates or our labor costs increase significantly, our business operations and financial performance could be adversely impacted. 11Table of ContentsOur international operations may result in additional market risks, which may harm our business.We operate stores outside of the United States. As these operations grow, they may require greater management and financial resources. International operations require the integration of personnel with varying cultural and business backgrounds and an understanding of the relevant differences in the cultural, legal, and regulatory environments. Our results may be increasingly affected by the risks of our international activities, including:• Fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • Changes in international staffing and employment issues; • Tariff and other trade barriers; • Greater difficulty in utilizing and enforcing our intellectual property rights;• Failure to understand the local culture and market; • The burden of complying with foreign laws, including tax laws, and financial accounting and reporting standards; and• Political and economic instability and developments. Our business may be harmed if the operation of veterinary hospitals at our stores is limited or fails to continue.We, Banfield, and the third-party operators of our other veterinary hospitals are subject to statutes and regulations in various states, territories, and provinces regulating the ownership of veterinary practices, or the operation of veterinary hospitals in stores, that may impact our ability to host and Banfield's ability to operate veterinary hospitals within our facilities. A determination that we, or Banfield, are in violation of any of these applicable statutes and regulations could require us, or Banfield, to restructure our operations to comply, or render us, or Banfield, unable to operate veterinary hospitals in a given location. If Banfield were to experience financial or other operating difficulties that would force it to limit its operations, or if Banfield were to cease operating the veterinary hospitals in our stores, our business may be harmed. We can make no assurances that we could contract with another third party to operate the veterinary hospitals on favorable terms, if at all, or that we could successfully operate the veterinary hospitals ourselves. In addition, due to our equity investment in Banfield, any significant decrease in Banfield's financial results may negatively impact our financial position. We face various risks as an e-commerce retailer.We may require additional capital in the future to sustain or grow our e-commerce business. We have engaged a third party to maintain our e-commerce website, petsmart.com, and process all customer orders placed through that site. Business risks related to our e-commerce business include our ability to keep pace with rapid technological developments and change; our ability to accurately anticipate pet parent e-commerce expectations; failure in our, or any third-party processor's, security procedures and operational controls; failure or inadequacy in our, or any third-party processor's, systems or ability to process customer orders; government regulation and legal uncertainties with respect to e-commerce; and collection of sales or other taxes by one or more states, territories, or foreign jurisdictions. If any of these risks materialize, it could impair our ability to deliver a positive omnichannel experience to our pet parents, and therefore, have an adverse effect on our business. Our business could be harmed if we were unable to effectively manage our cash flow and raise any needed additional capital on acceptable terms.We expect to fund our currently planned operations with existing capital resources, including cash flows from operations and the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. If, however, we are unable to effectively manage our cash flows or generate and maintain positive operating cash flows and operating income in the future, we may need additional funding. We may also choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Our revolving credit facility and stand-alone letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our financial assets. This could limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional financing and may make additional debt financing outside our revolving credit facility and stand-alone letter of credit facility more costly. If additional capital were needed, an inability to raise capital on favorable terms (including any limitation caused by disruption in the broader financial markets) could harm our business and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities convertible into equity, the issuance of these securities could result in dilution or accretion to our stockholders.12Table of ContentsFailure to successfully integrate any business we acquire could have an adverse impact on our financial results.We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations, and general operating procedures. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet or exceed our expectations, and therefore, affect our financial performance.Failure to protect our intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results. Our trademarks, servicemarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, domain names, and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized reproduction, or other misappropriation of our intellectual property, could diminish the value of our brands or goodwill and cause a decline in our revenue or operating results. Protecting our intellectual property outside the United States could be time-consuming and costly, and the local laws and regulations outside the United States may not fully protect our rights in such intellectual property. Any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business.Laws and regulations at the local, regional, state, federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new legislation that affect employment/labor (including minimum wage requirements, overtime, terms and conditions of employment, working conditions, and citizenship requirements); veterinary practices, or the operation of veterinary hospitals in stores; that may impact our ability to operate veterinary hospitals in certain facilities; the transportation, handling, and sale of small pets; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and biohazardous materials; the distribution, import/export, and sale of products; providing services to our customers; contracted services with various third-party providers; environmental regulation; credit and debit card processing; the handling, security, protection, and use of customer and associate information; the licensing and certification of services; and product safety, could have an adverse impact, directly or indirectly, on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business.We seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate. Given varying and uncertain interpretations of these laws and regulations and the fact that the laws and regulations are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion, we can make no assurances that we would be found to be in compliance in all jurisdictions. We also could be subject to costs, including fines, penalties, or sanctions and third-party claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, the above-referenced laws and regulations.We may be subject to various types of litigation and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. From time to time the Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including those related to federal or state wage and hour laws, product liability, consumer protection, advertising, employment, intellectual property, tort and other matters. We may also be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of our proprietary brand products. We may incur losses relating to claims filed against us, including costs associated with defending against them, and there is risk that any such claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage, or affect our ability to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Insurance costs continue to be volatile, and affected by natural catastrophes, fear of terrorism, financial irregularities, and fraud at other publicly traded companies, and fiscal viability of insurers. We believe that commercial insurance coverage is prudent for risk management, and insurance costs may increase substantially in the future. In addition, for certain types or levels of risk, such as risks associated with earthquakes, hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, we may determine that we cannot obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices. Therefore, we may choose to forgo or limit our purchase of relevant commercial insurance, choosing instead to self-insure one or more types or levels of risks. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. We maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant 13Table of Contentschanges in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Fluctuations in the stock market, as well as general economic and market conditions, may impact our operations, sales, financial results, and market price of our common stock.Over the last several years, the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations. The market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to the impact on our operations, sales and financial results of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:• General economic changes; • Actions taken by our competitors, including new product introductions and pricing changes;• Changes in the strategy and capability of our competitors;• Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions; • The prospects of our industry; • Natural disasters, hostilities, and acts of terrorism; and• National or regional catastrophes or circumstances, such as a pandemic or other public health or welfare scare.In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, including but not limited to those listed above, may harm the market price of our common stock. Further, a change in an analyst's published opinion or rating of our business could impact the market price of our common stock.We have implemented some anti-takeover provisions that may prevent or delay an acquisition of us that may not be beneficial to our stockholders.Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws include provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change in management or control that our stockholders may not believe is in their best interests. These provisions include:•The ability of our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series with rights, obligations and preferences determined by the Board of Directors;• No right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;• No right of stockholders to act by written consent; • Certain advance notice procedures for nominating candidates for election to the Board of Directors; and• No right to cumulative voting. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation requires a 66 2/3% vote of stockholders to:• Alter or amend our bylaws; • Remove a director without cause; or • Alter, amend, or repeal certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation.We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and the application of Section 203 could delay or prevent an acquisition of PetSmart.Item 1B.
