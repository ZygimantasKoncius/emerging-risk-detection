See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions of previous estimates are comprised of 65 MMBOE of negative price revisions offset by 37 MMBOE of positive technical revisions. The Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2009 were determined using the average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices during the 12-month 26 Table of Contents period ending December 31, 2009 of $61.14 per barrel of oil and $3.87 per Mcf of gas, compared to $44.60 per barrel of oil and $5.71 per Mcf of gas as of December 31, 2008. Tabular proved reserves disclosures. On a BOE basis, 58 percent of the Companys total proved reserves at December 31, 2009 were proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31, 2009, and using the Companys production information for the year then ended, the reserve-to-production ratio associated with the Companys proved reserves was in excess of 20 years on a BOE basis.

(b) See Unaudited Supplementary Information included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding the impact of the Reserve Ruling and ASU 2010-03 on the Companys proved reserves and Standardized Measure. Proved undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has 4,582 proved undeveloped well locations (all of which are expected to be developed within the five years ended December 31, 2014), representing a decrease of 395 proved undeveloped well locations (eight percent) since December 31, 2008. The decrease in proved undeveloped well locations during 2009 is primarily attributable to decreases in Raton basin well locations due to gas price revisions that rendered certain locations uneconomic under proved reserve pricing guidelines and 114 undeveloped well locations that were drilled and completed as developed wells during 2009, at a net cost of $76.3 million. During 2008, the Company initiated cost reduction initiatives that included minimizing drilling activities until margins improved as a result of (i) commodity price increases and/or (ii) well cost reductions. Associated therewith, the Company significantly curtailed development expenditures during the first nine months of 2009. As a result of the successes realized from the aforementioned cost reduction initiatives and increases in 2009 oil prices, the Company implemented a plan to resume oil- and liquids-rich-gas-focused drilling activities during 2010 and has targeted its 2010 capital budget at $800 million to $900 million, excluding acquisitions, effects of asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs. The Companys proved undeveloped well locations as of December 31, 2009 include 1,675 well locations that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. Approximately 93 percent of the Companys proved undeveloped well locations that have remained undeveloped for five years or more are comprised of locations in the Spraberry field of West Texas in the Permian Basin. The Company recorded four proved undeveloped well locations and 2 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves in the United States under the reliable technology and reasonable certainty provisions of the Reserve Ruling, which would not have been recorded under the rules existing prior to the Reserve Ruling. 27 Table of Contents The following table represents the estimated timing and cash flows of developing the Companys proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, (a) EstimatedFutureProduction(MBOE) FutureCashInflows FutureProductionCosts FutureDevelopmentCosts Future NetCash Flows 2010 1,874 $ 88,586 $ 19,008 $ 293,305 $ (223,727 ) 2011 6,693 280,931 53,081 619,957 (392,107 ) 2012 12,705 500,917 94,827 902,030 (495,940 ) 2013 18,289 721,328 136,294 1,052,605 (467,571 ) 2014 24,025 958,942 178,621 1,171,222 (390,901 ) Thereafter 311,151 12,005,180 3,935,060 194,532 7,875,588 374,737 $ 14,555,884 $ 4,416,891 $ 4,233,651 $ 5,905,342 (a) Beginning in 2010 and thereafter, the production and cash flows represent the drilling results from the respective year plus the incremental effects of proved undeveloped drilling. Description of Properties United States Approximately 88 percent of the Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2009 are located in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin area, the Hugoton and West Panhandle fields in the Mid-Continent area and the Raton field in the Rocky Mountains area. These fields generate substantial operating cash flow and the Spraberry and Raton fields have a large portfolio of low-risk drilling opportunities. The cash flows generated from these fields provide funding for the Companys other development and exploration activities both domestically and internationally.

Permian Basin Spraberry field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. According to the Energy Information Administration, the Spraberry field is the second largest oil field in the United States. The field is approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are produced primarily from three formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. In addition, the Company continues to complete the majority of its wells in the Wolfcamp formation, at depths ranging from 9,200 feet to 11,300 feet with successful results. The Company believes the Spraberry field offers excellent opportunities to grow oil and gas production because of the numerous undeveloped drilling locations, many of which are reflected in the Companys proved undeveloped reserves, and the ability to contain operating expenses and drilling costs through economies of scale. During 2008, the Company initiated a program to test 20-acre infill drilling performance, as part of its announced recovery improvement initiatives. The Company drilled and completed eleven 20-acre wells in 2008 and completed nine additional 20-acre wells in 2009 with encouraging results. During 2010, the Company is commencing a Spraberry field waterflood project that is located on approximately 7,000 acres within an existing Spraberry unit. Drilling, conversion and facility work should be completed during the first half of 2010 with water injection commencing during the second half of 2010. The 20-acre well spacing and waterflood initiatives described above are being implemented to increase the Spraberry field recovery percentage in those areas of the field that are expected to be conducive for these undertakings. However, the ultimate incremental recovery rates associated with these initiatives cannot be precisely predicted at this time. During 2009, the Company drilled 48 wells in the Spraberry field and acquired approximately 32,000 gross acres, bringing its total acreage position to approximately 884,000 gross acres (755,000 net acres). In support of the cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2008, the majority of the Companys 2009 drilling program was limited to wells necessary to hold acreage. As a result of successes realized from the Companys cost reduction initiatives and rising oil prices during the first half of 2009, the Company began increasing its rig count and drilling expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2009, with 12 rigs running in the Spraberry field at the end of the year. The Company plans to increase its rig count throughout 2010, with approximately 425 wells planned for the year. The Company intends to continue to expand its drilling program past 2010, with plans to increase its rig count to 40 rigs by 2012, during which the Company expects to drill approximately 1,000 wells per year. The Company plans to acquire Company-owned rigs to support about 25 percent of the planned 40-rig program. 29 Table of Contents Mid-Continent Hugoton field. The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The gas is produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from 2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Companys gas in the Hugoton field has an average energy content of 1,025 Btu. The Companys Hugoton properties are located on approximately 285,000 gross acres (247,000 net acres), covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells in the Hugoton field, approximately 990 of which it operates, and partial royalty interests in approximately 220 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the gathering and processing facilities, primarily through the Satanta plant, which processes its production from the Hugoton field. This ownership allows the Company to control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its Hugoton field gas and NGL production. The Companys Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing approximately 65 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e., gas production at the wellhead before processing or field fuel use and before reduction for royalties). Pioneer successfully led a cooperative effort with other operators in this field to effect rule changes which will enable further field development in future years. As part of the rule changes, the state-regulated production allowables were canceled as of December 31, 2007, and the Company received regulatory approval to commingle production from the Panoma and Council Grove formations. A commingling program was initiated in 2008 with positive results and the Company is evaluating expanding this project further. To capitalize on these rule changes, future completion designs have been developed along with an optimization plan for the existing field compression system. West Panhandle field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas. These stable, long-lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Companys gas in the West Panhandle field has an average energy content of 1,365 Btu and is produced from approximately 675 wells on more than 250,000 gross acres (240,000 net acres) covering over 375 square miles. The Company controls 100 percent of the wells, production equipment, gathering system and the Fain gas processing plant for the field. As this field is operated at or below vacuum conditions, Pioneer continually works to improve compressor and gathering system efficiency. Rocky Mountains The Raton Basin properties are located in the southeast portion of Colorado. Exploration for CBM in the Raton Basin began in the late 1970s and continued through the late 1980s, with several companies drilling and testing more than 100 wells during this period. The absence of a pipeline to transport gas from the Raton Basin prevented full scale development until January 1995, when Colorado Interstate Gas Company completed the construction of the Picketwire lateral pipeline system (the Picketwire Lateral). Since the completion of the Picketwire Lateral, production has continued to grow, resulting in expansion of the systems capacity by its operator, the most recent expansion of which was in 2005. The Company owns approximately 318,000 gross acres (231,000 net acres) in the center of the Raton Basin with current production from coal seams in the Vermejo and Raton formations. The Companys gas in the Raton Basin has an average energy content of 1,003 Btu. The Company owns the majority of the well servicing and fracture stimulation equipment that it utilizes in the Raton field, allowing it to control costs and insure availability. In the Raton field, the Company sells its gas at a Mid-Continent index price, which generally provides higher realized gas prices as compared to the Rockies-based indexes. During December 2009, the Company entered into a ten-year firm transportation contract that commences upon completion of a new 675-mile pipeline spanning from Opal, Wyoming to Malin, Oregon. Upon completion of the pipelines construction, which is currently anticipated during the first quarter of 2011, the Company will have 75,000 MMBtu per day of throughput capacity under this agreement. The Companys Raton Basin production volumes averaged 31,046 BOEPD for 2009. Production for 2009 experienced a 6 percent decline as compared to 2008 production. The Company continues to realize the benefits of its cost reduction initiatives in the Raton Basin, decreasing total production costs by 17 percent, as compared to 2008, contributing to a reduction of production costs (excluding production and ad valorem taxes) per BOE to $9.42 for 2009, as compared to $10.71 per BOE for 2008. The Company has been able to maintain relatively stable production, with low rates of decline, through initiatives such as compressor upgrades and optimization of compressor configurations. 30 Table of Contents The production decline for 2009, as compared to 2008, is due to the small capital investment in the field for 2009. The Company drilled seven development wells in the Raton CBM field in 2009 and completed projects to enhance its gathering and compression facilities in the area. Onshore Gulf Coast Drilling in the South Texas area in 2009 was sharply curtailed in support of the Companys cost reduction initiatives. The 2009 drilling activity was primarily focused on delineating the Eagle Ford Shale formation within the Companys existing 310,000 gross acre lease position. Production volumes averaged 12,016 BOEPD in 2009, representing a 5 percent decline from 2008 daily production. A total of three wells were completed during 2009 in the onshore Gulf Coast area of operations. One Eagle Ford Shale exploration well, the Frederich Gas Unit No. 1, was spud in 2008 and completed as a discovery and brought on production during 2009. Another Eagle Ford Shale well, the Sinor Ranch No. 5, was completed as a discovery during 2009. Additionally, two Eagle Ford wells began drilling and remained in progress on December 31, 2009. The Crawley Gas Unit No.1 was completed as a discovery in early January 2010 and an additional Eagle Ford Shale well was in progress as of December 31, 2009 and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2010. Over 2,000 square miles of 3-D seismic data originally acquired to assess Edwards formation drilling opportunities has been used for identifying and prioritizing Eagle Ford Shale well locations. In addition, the 3-D seismic coverage is being used to generate prioritized Edwards formation drilling. Numerous Edwards formation development well locations remain to be drilled in the previously discovered Moray, Sawfish, Skipjack and Amberjack fields. In addition there are several as yet undrilled exploration prospects. The Company continues to maintain a strong leasehold position in South Texas through lease renewals and acquisitions. The Company has announced plans to seek a joint venture partner for all or a portion of its Eagle Ford Shale acreage position. The Company expects to receive bids from potential joint venture partners during the second quarter of 2010 and close a transaction by mid-year. There can be no assurance that a joint venture transaction can be consummated on terms acceptable to the Company. Barnett Shale During 2009, the Companys production volumes averaged 3,002 BOEPD, representing a 24 percent increase over 2008 daily production. The Company participated in the drilling of four successful exploration and development wells on non-operated properties. Another three non-operated wells were drilled, but were not completed as of December 31, 2009. During 2009, the Company enhanced its Barnett Shale acreage position through leasing and acquisitions and acquired approximately 130 square miles of 3-D seismic data. During 2009, the Company focused on improving operational efficiencies, including completing several compressor and artificial lift optimization projects, completing well workovers and enhancing the capacity of water disposal systems. The Companys total lease holdings in the Barnett Shale play now approximate 65,000 gross acres, most of which is supported by 3-D seismic data. Alaska Oooguruk. In 2002, the Company acquired a 70 percent working interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaskas North Slope, and in 2003 drilled three exploratory wells to test a possible extension of the productive sands in the Kuparuk River field in the shallow waters offshore the North Slope of Alaska. Although all three of the wells found the sands filled with oil, they were too thin to be considered commercial on a stand-alone basis. However, the wells also encountered thick sections of oil-bearing Jurassic-aged sands, and the first well flowed at a rate of approximately 1,300 Bbls per day. In January 2004, the Company farmed-into a large acreage block to the southwest of the Companys discovery. In 2004, Pioneer completed an extensive technical and economic evaluation of the resource potential within this area. As a result of this evaluation, the Company performed front-end engineering and permitting activities during 2005 to further define the scope of the project. In early 2006, the Company announced that it had approved the development of the Oooguruk field in the project area. 31 Table of Contents The Company constructed and armored a gravel drilling and production island site in 2006. Installation of a subsea flowline and production facilities to carry produced liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River Unit was completed in 2007. Pioneer assembled the drilling rig on location and commenced drilling the first of an estimated 33 horizontal development and injector wells in December of 2007. During 2008, the Company completed two producing wells, one injection well and one disposal well. The Company commenced production from the Oooguruk development project during the second quarter of 2008. During 2009, development and extension drilling progressed and net production averaged approximately 4,600 Bbls per day for the year. Development drilling is expected to continue throughout 2010 and beyond. Cosmopolitan. In 2005, the Company acquired an interest in the Cosmopolitan Unit in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. Through a series of transactions, the Company now owns 100 percent of the Cosmopolitan Unit. The previous operator of the Cosmopolitan Unit had an oil discovery for which economic viability was not determined. During 2005 and 2006, the Company completed and interpreted a 3-D seismic shoot. During 2007, the Company drilled the Hansen #1A L1 well, a lateral sidetrack from an existing wellbore, to appraise the resource potential of the unit. The initial unstimulated production test results were encouraging and additional permitting and facilities planning ensued during 2008 to further evaluate the units resource potential. During 2009, the Company progressed engineering studies and commenced a workover of the Hansen #1A-L1 well. During 2010, the Company plans to complete the Hansen #1A-L1 workover, fracture stimulate the well, flow test the well, evaluate the production flow rate information from the fractured well test, progress project permitting and develop plans for a second well to further delineate the extent of the units resource potential. International The Companys international operations are located offshore South Africa and onshore in southern Tunisia.

The Sable oil field began producing in August 2003 and was shut in at the end of the third quarter of 2008. Over its five-year life, the Sable oil field performed better than expected, recovering approximately 23.6 million gross barrels of oil. During the life of the Sable oil field, the majority of the gas produced in conjunction with the oil 32 Table of Contents production was injected back into the reservoir. The Company had a 40 percent working interest in the oil production from the Sable field. In 2005, the Company sanctioned the non-operated South Coast Gas development project, which included a subsea tie-back of gas from the Sable field and five additional gas accumulations to an existing production facility on the F-A platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a gas-to-liquids plant. Pioneer has a 45 percent working interest in the project. As part of sanctioning of the South Coast Gas project, the Company signed a six-year contract for the sale of its gas and condensate production from the project. The contract contains an obligation for the purchaser to take or pay for a total of 91.4 Bcf and associated condensate if the anticipated deliverability estimates are achieved. The price for both gas and condensate is indexed to Brent oil prices. First production from the South Coast Gas project was achieved in the third quarter of 2007. A significant portion of the gas reserves associated with the South Coast Gas project are in the Sable field. In the third quarter of 2008, Sable oil production was shut in and operations to convert Sables gas injection well to a producing well commenced. Gas sales from the Sable gas well were initiated in mid-October 2008 and the other South Coast Gas wells resumed production in late-October. The Sable gas well is the most productive well in the South Coast Gas project. Tunisia The Company holds interests in four separate onshore permits located in the southern portion of Tunisia. These permits cover a gross area of approximately 12,740 square kilometers containing two production concessions targeting the Acacus formation with additional future upside exploration potential from this and other formations. Jenein Nord Permit and Cherouq Concession. The Jenein Nord Permit covers approximately 1,240 square kilometers. Since 2004, the Company has conducted seismic data acquisition and exploration drilling over the area. As a result of a seismic data acquisition and exploration drilling program, the Company has achieved a significant number of hydrocarbon discoveries. Based on the success, the Company, along with the government oil agency, Enterprise Tunisienne dActivities Petrolieres (ETAP), submitted a joint application on November 10, 2007 to the Directeur Général de lEnergie for the development of a portion of the permit area called the Cherouq Concession. On December 17, 2007, the Consultative Committee of Hydrocarbons, the advisory committee to the Directeur Général de lEnergie, approved the Cherouq Concession, resulting in the Company and ETAP each holding a 50 percent working interest in the concession. The concession covers approximately 760 square kilometers of the Jenein Nord Permit. Since the second half of 2006, the Company has drilled fourteen wells in the concession, with first production being achieved in late 2007. As of December 2009, gross production from the Cherouq Concession has been approximately 5.9 million barrels. The Company plans to install an artificial lift system and commence drilling operations in the first half of 2010. The Company had one exploratory well suspended and classified as in progress as of December 31, 2009 on the Jenein Nord permit. Borj El Khadra Permit and Adam Concession. The Borj El Khadra Permit, including the Adam Concession, covers approximately 3,725 square kilometers. Production from the Adam Concession began in May 2003, for which the Company has a 20 percent and 40 percent working interest on exploitation and exploration activities, respectively. During 2009, the Company continued its exploratory and appraisal activities on the Adam Concession by drilling three wells, of which one was a successful Adam concession development well and two were unsuccessful Borj El Khadra Permit exploratory wells. The Company plans to drill up to three additional wells in the Adam Concession during 2010. On the Borj El Khadra Permit the Company intends to acquire an additional 850 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data and drill an exploration well. The Company had two Borj El Khadra Permit exploratory wells and one Adam concession extension well suspended and classified as in progress as of December 31, 2009. El Hamra Permit. The El Hamra exploration permit covers approximately 4,000 square kilometers, of which the Company is operator with a 50 percent working interest during the exploration period. During 2010, the Company plans to further interpret the seismic data in order to develop existing geological prospects. 33 Table of Contents Anaguid Permit. The Anaguid exploration permit covers approximately 3,800 square kilometers. In 2007, the Company acquired an additional 15 percent interest in the Anaguid exploration permit, thereby increasing its interest to 60 percent (during the exploration period) and resulting in the transfer of operations to Pioneer. During 2009, the Company prepared a plan of development to request approval to convert a portion of the existing exploration permit into a production concession. The Company plans to drill up to two additional Anaguid exploration wells during 2010 and had one exploratory well suspended and classified as in progress as of December 31, 2009. Selected Oil and Gas Information The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information from continuing operations for the Company as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. 34 Table of Contents Production, price and cost data. The following tables set forth production, price and cost data with respect to the Companys properties for 2009, 2008 and 2007. These amounts represent the Companys historical results from continuing operations without making pro forma adjustments for any acquisitions, divestitures or drilling activity that occurred during the respective years. The production amounts will not agree to the reserve volume tables in the Unaudited Supplementary Information section included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data due to field fuel volumes and production from discontinued operations being included in the reserve volume tables.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion) and to conform to the current year presentation. (b) The Companys oil and gas revenues for 2009, as compared to those of 2008, declined by $617.6 million (or 28 percent) due to declines in commodity prices, partially offset by a two percent increase in sales volumes. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussions about oil and gas revenues and factors impacting the comparability of such revenues. (c) On January 31, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge accounting for its derivative contracts and began using the mark-to-market (MTM) method of accounting for derivatives. Under the MTM method of accounting, the Company recognized $195.6 million of derivative losses, net in its total costs and expenses of 2009, including $191.5 million of noncash MTM losses. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Notes B and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information about the Companys derivative contracts and associated accounting methods. (d) During 2009, the Company recorded $119.3 million of pretax income for the recovery of excess royalties paid on oil and gas production from its deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties during the period from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005, and a $17.5 million pretax gain, primarily from the sale of substantially all of its Gulf of Mexico shelf properties. The Companys Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater properties were sold effective July 1, 2009 and January 1, 2006, respectively. The results of operations of these properties, and certain other properties sold during the periods presented are classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP. See Notes B and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about the Companys discontinued operations. (e) Income from continuing operations per share and net income attributable to common stockholders per share amounts have been restated for the January 1, 2009 adoption of FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1 (FSP EITF 03-6-1) to exclude the earnings of participating securities in the determination of net income (loss) per share. See Notes B and Q of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion about this change in GAAP. 43 Table of Contents Item 7.

The decrease in earnings attributable to common stockholders is primarily due to:  A $617.6 million pretax decline in oil and gas revenues as a result of commodity price declines, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes;  A $185.4 million pretax increase in net derivative losses, primarily due to rising oil and NGL prices since the Companys January 31, 2009 change from hedge accounting to the mark-to market (MTM) accounting method; and  A $161.8 million pretax increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense, primarily due to (i) negative price revisions resulting from lower commodity prices during 2009 as compared to 2008 and (ii) negative reserve price revisions in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the SECs new reserve reporting rules; partially offset by:  A $108.3 million decrease in pretax oil and gas production costs and production and ad valorem taxes, primarily due to successes realized from the Companys cost reduction initiatives and commodity price declines, respectively;  A $93.3 million increase in after-tax income from discontinued operations, primarily due to $119.3 million of pretax income recognized for the recovery of excess deepwater Gulf of Mexico royalties paid during 2003 through 2005 and a $17.5 million pretax gain from the divestiture of substantially all of the Companys Gulf of Mexico shelf properties during 2009; and  A $76.4 million increase in pretax Alaskan Petroleum Production Tax credit dispositions.  Daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased on a per BOE basis by three percent to 115 MBOEPD during 2009, as compared to 112 MBOEPD during 2008. Approximately 1,100 BOEPD of 2009 annual production was lost due to unplanned third-party pipeline repairs in Alaska and the Mid-Continent area and to longer-than-anticipated gas-to-liquids plant maintenance shutdowns in South Africa.  Average reported oil, NGL and gas prices from continuing operations decreased during 2009 to $72.49 per Bbl, $29.76 per Bbl and $3.99 per Mcf, respectively, as compared to respective prices of $74.53 per Bbl, $51.31 per Bbl and $7.64 per Mcf during 2008.  Average oil and gas production costs and ad valorem and production taxes per BOE from continuing operations decreased during 2009 to $9.08 and $2.35, respectively, as compared to respective per BOE costs of $10.32 and $4.01 during 2008, primarily as a result of cost reduction initiatives and commodity price declines.  Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $490.8 million to $543.1 million for 2009, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2008, primarily due to the decrease in oil and gas revenue.  Long-term debt was reduced by $138.2 million during 2009.  Pioneer Southwest issued 3.1 million common units during 2009 for net proceeds of $61.0 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of common units were used to reduce Pioneer Southwests credit facility indebtedness.  The Company issued $450 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2020 during November 2009 and used the net proceeds to reduce credit facility indebtedness. Significant Events Commodity prices. Beginning in the second half of 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, the United States and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic slowdown, which led to a substantial decline in worldwide energy demand. During this same time period, North American gas supply was increasing as a result of the rise in domestic unconventional gas production. The combination of lower energy demand due to the economic slowdown and higher North American gas supply resulted in significant declines in prices for oil, NGL and gas. While oil and NGL prices started to steadily improve beginning in the second quarter of 2009, gas prices remained volatile throughout 2009 due to high storage levels and increasing gas supply. The outlook for a 44 Table of Contents worldwide economic recovery in 2010 remains uncertain and therefore, the timing of a recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, it is likely that commodity prices during 2010 will continue to be volatile. Although the Company has entered into derivative contracts on a large portion of its production volumes through 2012, a sustained lower commodity price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which the Company could enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Companys cash flows would be reduced for affected periods. Significant or extended price declines could also adversely affect the amount of oil, NGL and gas that the Company can produce economically. The duration, timing and magnitude of any period of lower commodity prices cannot be predicted. A sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows, which could negatively affect the Companys liquidity, financial position and future results of operations. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $27.4 million of cash on hand and $1.2 billion of liquidity under its credit facility that matures in 2012. As of December 31, 2009, the Company also had $331.7 million of net accounts receivable and was a party to derivative financial instruments, of which approximately $92.3 million represented assets. Management is closely monitoring the credit standings of its customers; counterparties, including its banks; derivative counterparties and purchasers of the commodities the Company produces and sells. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Notes F and J, respectively of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information about the Companys credit facility and derivative contracts. Cost reduction initiatives. During the second half of 2008, the Company increased its emphasis on reducing capital spending, operating costs and administrative expenses to support its goal of delivering net cash flow from operating activities in excess of capital requirements in 2009 and to enhance and preserve financial flexibility. These initiatives included minimizing drilling activities until margins improved as a result of (i) commodity prices increasing and/or (ii) well cost reductions. As a result, the Company significantly reduced its 2009 rig activity and has realized and continues to pursue reductions in operating expenses and well costs to align costs with a lower commodity price environment. Rigs were terminated or stacked in the Spraberry, Raton, Edwards Trend and Barnett Shale areas and in Tunisia. Since the third quarter of 2008, when drilling and completion costs peaked, the Company has achieved a reduction of approximately 30 percent in the cost of drilling and completing a well in the Spraberry field. The Companys asset teams have also reduced 2009 lease operating expense per BOE from continuing operations by 13 percent during 2009, as compared to 2008. The cost savings reflect reductions in electricity, water disposal and compression rental costs and expanded use of Pioneers internal well services in the Spraberry field. During 2009, the Companys capital costs (excluding acquisitions, effects of asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs) were $312.9 million, as compared to $1.2 billion during 2008, representing a 74 percent decrease. As a result of the successes realized from the aforementioned cost reduction initiatives and increases in 2009 oil prices, the Company implemented a plan to resume oil- and liquids-rich-gas-focused drilling activities during 2010 and has preliminarily targeted its 2010 capital budget to be in a range of $800 million to $900 million (excluding acquisitions, effects of asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs). Historically, the Companys capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increased oil, NGL and gas prices. These costs may rise faster than increases in the Companys revenue, thereby negatively impacting the Companys profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned. Sale of assets to Pioneer Southwest. On August 31, 2009, the Company completed a sale of oil and gas properties in the Spraberry field to Pioneer Southwest pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement having an effective date of July 1, 2009. Associated therewith, Pioneer received $168.2 million of cash, including customary closing adjustments, and transferred net obligations associated with certain commodity price derivative positions and certain other liabilities to Pioneer Southwest. Proceeds were used to reduce Pioneers credit facility indebtedness and Pioneer Southwest funded the purchase with cash on hand and borrowings under its credit facility. Pioneer Southwest equity offering. On November 16, 2009, Pioneer Southwest completed a public offering of 3,105,000 common units representing limited partner interests (the Equity Offering). Net proceeds from the Equity Offering of $61.0 million were used to reduce Pioneer Southwests credit facility borrowings. Following the Equity Offering, Pioneer owns a 61.9 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. 45 Table of Contents Senior note issuance. In November 2009, the Company issued $450 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2020 for net proceeds of $438.6 million. The net proceeds were used to reduce the Companys credit facility indebtedness. Modernization of oil and gas reporting. During 2009, the SEC issued the Reserve Ruling and the FASB issued ASU 2010-03. The Reserve Ruling and the ASU 2010-03 are effective for annual reports on Forms 10-K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. The key provisions of the Reserve Ruling and ASU 2010-03, which impact the Companys disclosures and consolidated financial statements, are as follows:  Amending the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require the use of an average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices during the 12-month period ending on the balance sheet date rather than the period-end commodity prices;  Adding to and amending other definitions used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves, such as reliable technology and reasonable certainty;  Broadening the types of technology that a reporter may use to establish reserves estimates and categories; and  Changing disclosure requirements and providing formats for tabular reserve disclosures.
