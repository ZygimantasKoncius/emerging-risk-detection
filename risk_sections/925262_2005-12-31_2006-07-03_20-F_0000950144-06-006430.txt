Risk Factors. General The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations have been organized to present the following:  a brief overview of our company and the principal factors that influence our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity;  a review of our financial presentation and accounting policies, including our critical accounting estimates;  a discussion of the principal factors that influence our results of operations and liquidity;  a discussion of developments since the end of 2005 that may materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity;  a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003;  a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including our changes in financial position for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and our long-term indebtedness;  a discussion of our capital expenditures and our contractual commitments; and  a discussion of the principal differences between Mexican GAAP and U.S. GAAP as they relate to our financial statements. Overview We are a vertically integrated producer of paper and packaging products with an extensive distribution network that links our strategically located facilities with our customers. We believe that these factors, as well as our investment in modern manufacturing technology and our access to raw materials as Mexicos only producer of unbleached virgin kraft pulp and one of Mexicos largest users of recycled paper, based on information published by 29 the Mexican National Chamber for the Pulp and Paper Industry, allow us to be one of the industrys lowest cost producers. Our results of operations have been influenced and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including:  the substantial reduction in our production capacity and product offerings as a result of the disposition of Pronal and the molded pulp division of Empaques de Cartón Titán, or Titán, and our disposition of our Chihuahua particleboard plant;  the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness, which affects our net financial expenses;  the Mexican and U.S. market prices of corrugated containers, containerboard and newsprint, which significantly affect our net revenue;  the level of production capacity in the United States and Mexico for the products that we sell and our capacity utilization rate, which significantly affects the cost of producing our products and may lead to the impairment of our assets;  the Mexican and U.S. market prices of OCC and ONP, the principal raw materials in our paper manufacturing operations, which significantly affect the cost of producing our products;  the growth rates of Mexican GDP and U.S. GDP, which affect the demand for our products, and consequently our sales volume;  the exchange rate of the peso against the dollar, which affects our net sales in pesos and our financing costs;  inflation rates in Mexico; and  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. Our financial condition and liquidity are and will be influenced by a variety of factors, including:  our financial restructuring following our defaults on our unsecured debt in November 2002;  our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;  prevailing domestic and international interest rates and movements in exchange rates, which affect our debt service requirements;  our limited ability to borrow funds from Mexican and international financial institutions or to sell our debt securities in the Mexican and international securities markets, primarily as a result of covenants included in our restructured indebtedness; and  our capital expenditure requirements, which consist primarily of maintenance of our operating facilities. Financial Presentation and Accounting Policies Consolidated Financial Statements We have prepared our audited consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for the three years ended December 31, 2005 in accordance with Mexican GAAP, which differs in significant respects from U.S. GAAP. Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements provides a description of the principal 30 differences between Mexican GAAP and U.S. GAAP applicable to our company and a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP of our consolidated net income (loss) and total stockholders equity as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for the three years ended December 31, 2005. Business Segments We manage our business and report our results on a product basis in three segments. Our reportable segments are:  Paper  This segment includes our production and sale of containerboard (linerboard and corrugating medium), newsprint and uncoated free sheet. This segment includes the operating results of the Grupo Durango division and the Grupo Pipsamex division in Mexico and Durango McKinley Paper Companys paper operations in the United States.  Packaging  This segment includes the production and sale of corrugated containers, multi-wall sacks and paper tubes. This segment includes the operating results of the packaging division in Mexico and the U.S.  Other  This segment includes the production and sale of plywood. In 2005, paper products accounted for 42.9% of our net sales to third parties, packaging products accounted for 55.9% of our net sales to third parties and other products accounted for the remaining 1.2% of our net sales to third parties. Discontinued Operations In connection with our financial and operating restructuring, during 2003 we authorized the discontinuation and/or sale of some subsidiaries or significant assets. The related assets, liabilities and operating results are presented in our audited consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. In 2003, our discontinued operations consisted of (1) the molded pulp division of Titán, which we sold on February 27, 2003, (2) Pronal, which we sold on November 14, 2003, and (3) the Chihuahua particleboard plant of Ponderosa. In 2004, our discontinued operations consisted of the Chihuahua particleboard plant of Ponderosa. In 2005, our discontinued operations consisted of the Chihuahua particleboard plant of Ponderosa, which we sold on July 15, 2005. Critical Accounting Estimates We have identified the most critical accounting estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and that management believes are important to a more complete understanding of our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In order to provide an understanding about how we form our judgments and estimates about certain future events, including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates, and the sensitivity of those judgments to different variables and conditions, we have included comments related to the following critical accounting estimates under Mexican GAAP. Allowance for doubtful accounts We have attempted to reserve for expected credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate. It is possible, however, that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time. We continually review and refine the estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these accounts receivable. 31 Deferred taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves our estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred assets, inventories, property, machinery and equipment, accrued expenses and tax loss carryforwards, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards, we first consider the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences that are expected to generate taxable income during the tax loss carryforward periods. Subsequently, we consider any tax planning strategies if prudent and feasible. Property, plant and equipment Fixed assets and intangible assets are assigned useful lives, which impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense. The assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. Changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change. We also evaluate the carrying value of property, plant and equipment to be held and used and any assets to be disposed of when events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as temporary shut downs of plants or permanent closures. Such reviews have been necessary in recent years. Prior to December 31, 2003, Mexican GAAP required the calculation of impairment of long-lived assets by comparing the unamortized carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future expected cash flows to be generated by the assets, without interest charges. Under these rules, if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss was recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets. We recorded impairment losses for our long-lived assets of Ps 656.1 million during 2003 in other income (expenses)  net in our statement of operations and reserved these amounts against the value of our property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet. The deferred income tax effect for this reserve resulted in a benefit of Ps 210.0 million during 2003, which was recorded in income tax benefit (expenses) in our statement of operations. On January 1, 2004, we adopted Bulletin C-15, Impairment of the Value of Long-Lived Assets and Their Disposal, issued by MIPA, or Bulletin C-15. Bulletin C-15 establishes general criteria for the identification and, if applicable, recording of losses from impairment or the decrease in value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill. Bulletin C-15 requires the calculation of impairment of long-lived assets by comparing the unamortized carrying amount of the asset to the net present value of future expected net cash flows. Under Bulletin C-15, if the net present value of future expected net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss was recognized for the difference between the net present value of future expected net cash flows and carrying value of the assets. We recorded a favorable adjustment of Ps 113.8 million and a charge of Ps 479.1 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, in other income (expenses). For U.S. GAAP purposes, beginning on January 1, 2002, we follow SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 provides criteria for when and in what circumstances an impairment loss (write-down) should be recorded and the manner in which the write-down should be measured. An evaluation of impairment is undertaken whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Under SFAS 144, the impairment criteria is met when the carrying value of assets exceeds the sum of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related assets. If it is determined that an asset is impaired, it is written down to its fair value, if available or the present value of expected future cash flows. 32 The estimates of undiscounted cash flows and the net present value of future expected net cash flows takes into consideration expectations of future macroeconomic conditions as well as our companys internal strategic plans. Therefore, inherent in the estimated future cash flows is a certain level of risk that we have considered in our valuation; nevertheless, actual future results may differ. For assets to be disposed of, our company assesses whether machinery or equipment can be used at other facilities and if not, estimates the proceeds to be realized upon sale of the assets. Our company has recorded impairment losses related to certain unused assets and such losses may potentially occur in the future. We reviewed the fair value less disposal cost of the long-lived assets for which management has committed to a plan of disposal, principally Ponderosas Chihuahua particleboard plant in 2003, and recorded impairment losses for these assets of Ps 381.8 million during 2003 in income (loss) from discontinued operations  net in our statement of operations. The deferred income tax effect for this reserve resulted in a benefit of Ps 122.1 during 2003, which was recorded in income (loss) from discontinued operations  net in our statement of operations. Pension plans, seniority premiums and indemnities The determination of our obligations for pension plans, seniority premiums and indemnities are dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Those assumptions are described in note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements and include, among others, the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and our future expense. Negative goodwill Until December 31, 2004, negative goodwill is amortized under the straight-line method over a period not to exceed two years, which in our opinion, approximates the period in which the acquired subsidiaries are integrated into our company. Determination of the period that it takes an acquired subsidiary to be integrated into our company involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. Effective January 1, 2005, Statement B-7, Business Acquisitions, establishes, among other things, that the purchase method should be used to account for business acquisition. In addition, it modifies the accounting treatment of goodwill, ceasing its amortization, but subjecting it to annual impairment test. Statement B-7 also provides specific guidance for the accounting for acquisition of minority interest and transfer of assets of stock among entities under common control. Leasing operations are registered under Statement D-5, Leasing. We capitalize leased asset related to industrial machinery and equipment. These assets are depreciated under the depreciation rates of the common acquired assets. Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Liquidity Our Financial Restructuring In November 2002, we defaulted on payments of principal and interest under our unsecured indebtedness. As a result of the factors described below, we did not generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make a total of US$52.2 million of principal or a total of US$34.7 million of interest payments that were due on our unsecured indebtedness during 2002. In 2003, we did not pay a total of US$77.3 million of principal or a total of US$78.3 million of interest that was due on our unsecured indebtedness. In 2004, we did not pay a total of US$66.4 million of principal or a total of US$72.9 million of interest that was due on our unsecured indebtedness. Our liquidity crisis was caused by, among other things: 33  the substantial capital expenditures required to expand our production capacity, which resulted in a substantial debt service burden and led to our default on our unsecured indebtedness, which has restricted our access to the capital markets;  the economic slow-down in the U.S. and Mexico, which resulted in a reduction in the demand for manufactured products requiring the goods supplied by our company;  a significant drop in international market prices for paper and packaging products;  the significant increase in raw material costs and other production costs;  the devaluation of the peso against the dollar from 2002 to 2004; and  a significant delay in the implementation of our planned divestiture of certain non-strategic assets. In December 2002, we retained financial advisors to advise us in evaluating debt-restructuring alternatives to implement a long-term solution to our capital structure and debt service requirements. We also began discussions with our bank creditors and certain holders of our debt securities. On May 18, 2004, we filed a voluntary petition for concurso mercantil (commercial reorganization) under the LCM with the Mexican court. None of our subsidiaries filed for concurso mercantil or other bankruptcy protection in Mexico. On August 25, 2004, the Mexican court declared that we had satisfied all of the requirements to be a debtor under the LCM. We continued to negotiate with our creditors, and on August 13, 2004, we reached an agreement in principle with creditors collectively holding approximately 68% of our unsecured debt regarding the terms of a proposed plan of reorganization and a proposed plan support agreement. On November 17, 2004, the Mexican court certified the list of recognized claims in our commercial reorganization proceeding. On December 23, 2004, the conciliator (conciliadora) appointed by the Mexican Federal Institute of Commercial Reorganization Specialists (Instituto Federal de Especialistas de Concursos Mercantiles) in our commercial reorganization proceeding submitted our plan of reorganization to the holders of recognized claims that were party to our plan support agreement. The plan of reorganization provided that, in exchange for their debt, our unsecured financial creditors would receive new debt equal to approximately 85% of the outstanding principal amount of our unsecured debt. In addition to the new debt, the plan of reorganization provided that our unsecured financial creditors would receive a number of our Series B Shares representing an aggregate of approximately 17% of our capital stock on a fully diluted basis. The plan was executed by our company and the holders of a majority of the recognized claims on December 23, 2004. The conciliator submitted our executed plan of reorganization to the Mexican court on January 11, 2005, and it was approved by the Mexican court on February 7, 2005. On February 23, 2005, our plan of reorganization was consummated. As a result:  Bank creditors of our company with claims against our company in the amount of US$136.3 million (Ps 1,611.3 million) received 2,392,957 of our Series B Shares, representing 2.16% of our issued and outstanding capital stock, and the principal amount of the debt outstanding with respect to these claims was amended and restated under the Restructured Credit Agreement. Under the Restructured Credit Agreement, notes in an aggregate principal amount of US$116.1 million (Ps 1,294.6 million) were issued to the holders of these claims. These notes bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, and the principal amount of these notes will be amortized quarterly until the maturity of these notes on December 30, 2012.  Unsecured creditors of our company with claims against our company in the amount of US$510.3 million (Ps 5,689.9 million) related to our 2003 notes, 2006 notes, 2008 notes, 2009 notes and ECP note received 16,412,961 of our Series B Shares, representing 14.84% of our issued and outstanding capital stock, and an aggregate principal amount of US$433.8 million (Ps 4,836.5 million) of our 2012 notes in respect to these claims. The 2012 notes bear interest at a rate of 7.50% per annum until December 31, 2005, 8.50% per 34 annum from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and 9.50% per annum thereafter, payable quarterly in arrears, and mature on December 30, 2012. Our obligations under the Restructured Credit Agreement and the 2012 notes are guaranteed by the following subsidiaries: (1) Administración Corporativa de Durango, S. A. de C. V., or ACD, (2) Empaques de Cartón Titán, S.A. de C.V. or Titán (3) Envases y Empaques de México, S. A. de C. V., or Eyemex, (4) Cartonpack, S.A. de C.V., or Cartonpack, (5) Industrias Centauro, S.A. de C.V., or Centauro, (6) Compañía Papelera de Atenquique, S. A. de C. V., or Atenquique, (7) Ponderosa Industrial de México, S.A. de C. V. or Ponderosa, (8) Porteadores de Durango, S. A. de C. V., (9) Compañía Norteamericana de Inversiones en Celulosa y Papel, S. A. de C. V., (10) Reciclajes Centauro, S. A. de C. V., (11) Durango Internacional, S.A. de C. V. and (12) Durango International, Inc. In addition, our obligations under the Restructured Credit Agreement and the 2012 notes are secured by (1) the shares of Grupo Pipsamex and Durango McKinley Paper Company, (2) the real property of ACD, Titán, Eyemex, Cartonpack, Centauro, Atenquique and Ponderosa, and (3) certain assets of Titán and Eyemex. Disposition of Certain of Our Operations Our results of operations have been affected during the last three years by our disposition of some of our operations. As a result of these dispositions, our net sales, gross profit and operating income have decreased significantly and we have recorded significant other expenses and losses from discontinued operations. Disposition of Molded Pulp Division On February 27, 2003, our subsidiary, Titán, sold the assets of its molded pulp division for approximately US$53.7 million (Ps 650.8 million), resulting in a gain of Ps 364.1 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations  net in the statement of operations for 2003. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, Titán transferred to the buyer some accounts receivable and trade accounts payable, in order to enable the buyer to continue with the production and selling of molded products. As a result of this sale, the capacity of our packaging segment was reduced by 40 thousand short tons and we ceased producing molded pulp products. Disposition of Pronal On November 14, 2003, our subsidiary, Grupo Pipsamex, sold its subsidiary, Pronal, for US$28.0 million (Ps 354.2 million), resulting in a loss of Ps 486.4 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations  net in the statement of operations for 2003. As a result of this sale, the capacity of our paper segment was reduced by 160 thousand short tons and we ceased being the sole Mexican producer of newsprint. A portion of the proceeds of this sale was pledged to Bancomext under the terms of our loan agreements with Bancomext, and was included in our balance sheet as restricted cash as of December 31, 2003. On September 29, 2004, we used this restricted cash to prepay a portion of our loans to Bancomext. Disposition of Mexico City Warehouse On November 25, 2003, our subsidiary, Grupo Pipsamex, sold a warehouse located in Mexico City for US$11.5 million (Ps 140.4 million). As part of the sale, Grupo Pipsamex reserved the right to use a portion of the warehouse representing approximately one third of the entire property for a period of five years at no cost. This sale generated a loss of Ps 210.7 million, which is recorded in other expenses  net in our statement of operations for 2003. A portion of the proceeds of this sale is pledged to Bancomext under the terms of our loan agreements with Bancomext, and was included in our balance sheet as restricted cash as of December 31, 2003. On September 29, 2004, we used this restricted cash to prepay a portion of our loans to Bancomext. Disposition of Chihuahua Particleboard Operations During 2003, our management authorized a plan to sell a plant located in Chihuahua, which is primarily engaged in the manufacturing of particleboard. Based on negotiations with a potential buyer, we reduced the book value of 35 the net assets to be sold by Ps 381.8 million, which reduction is included in the net loss of discontinued operations in the statement of operations for 2003. On July 15, 2005, our subsidiaries, Ponderosa and Compañía Forestal de Durango S.A. de C.V., sold the assets of our Chihuahua particleboard plant for US$30 million. As a result of this sale, the capacity of our other segment was reduced by 200 thousand short tons, we ceased producing particleboard and, as of the date of this annual report, we no longer have any discontinued operations. Effect of Level of Indebtedness and Interest Rates At December 31, 2005, our total outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis was Ps 6,762.7 million. As a result of our substantial indebtedness, our company incurred interest expenses of Ps 592.4 million in 2005, Ps 1,158.3 million in 2004 and Ps 1,228.1 million in 2003. In addition, because substantially all of our indebtedness is denominated in dollars and the peso depreciated significantly against the dollar during 2003, our company incurred foreign exchange losses of Ps 892.8 million in 2003. These interest expenses and foreign exchange losses were substantial factors in our losses from continuing operations in 2004 and 2003. Our debt obligations with variable interest rates expose our company to market risks from changes in the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR. As a result of our defaults on our unsecured debt, Standard & Poors Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., or Standard & Poors, and Moodys Investors Service, or Moodys, have ceased rating our company and our debt instruments. As a result of the cessation of these ratings agencies coverage of our company and debt instruments, our access to sources of short-term and long-term financing has been severely restricted. Pricing of Our Products In 2005, paper products accounted for 42.9% of our net sales to third parties and packaging products accounted for 55.9% of our net sales to third parties. The pricing of our products is influenced by a number of factors, including:  industry capacity utilization and significant increases in capacity in the industry;  recycled fiber prices;  demand for packaging products as a result of the level of growth of the Mexican and U.S. economies;  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the peso and the dollar; and  prevailing inflation rates. Containerboard. Our prices for containerboard primarily reflect international paper prices. During 2003, our average price per short ton for containerboard declined by 5.7%, principally due to the slow economic recovery in the United States and Mexico. During 2004, our average price per short ton for containerboard increased by 15.2%, principally as a result of increased economic activity in Mexico and the United States. During 2005, our average price per short ton for containerboard declined by 12.7%, principally as a result of the contraction of the manufacturing industry in Mexico during 2005. Uncoated Free Sheet. Our prices for uncoated free sheet primarily reflect international paper prices. During 2003, our average price per short ton for uncoated free sheet decreased by 2.2%, principally due to the slow economic recovery in the United States and Mexico. During 2004, our average price per short ton for uncoated free sheet increased by 5.1%, principally as a result of increased economic activity in the United States and Mexico. During 2005, our average price per short ton for uncoated free sheet increased by 4.3%, principally reflecting the recovery of international prices of uncoated free sheet. 36 Newsprint. Our prices for newsprint primarily reflect international paper prices. We were the only producer of newsprint in Mexico from the end of 1998, when we acquired Grupo Pipsamex, until November 2003, when we sold Pronal. During 2003, our average price per short ton for newsprint decreased by 5.3%, principally due to the slow economic recovery in the United States and Mexico. During 2004, our average price per short ton for newsprint increased by 7.7%, principally as a result of the recovery of the international price of newsprint. During 2005, our average price per short ton for newsprint increased by 8.9%, principally reflecting the recovery of international prices of newsprint. Packaging products. In general, the prices of our packaging products fluctuate in accordance with international prices. As a result of generally low prices for packaging products in the United States, competition in Mexico from imports has increased. During 2003, our average price per short ton for corrugated containers decreased by 2.5%, principally due to the slow economic recovery in the United States and Mexico. During 2004, our average price per short ton for corrugated containers decreased by 0.2%. During 2005, our average price per short ton for corrugated containers decreased by 2.0%, principally due to the contraction of the manufacturing industry in Mexico during 2005. Cyclicality Affecting the Paper and Packaging Industry, Capacity Utilization and Pricing Global consumption of containerboard and newsprint has increased significantly over the past 30 years. Due to this growth in consumption, producers have experienced periods of insufficient capacity for these products. Periods of insufficient capacity, including some due to raw material shortages, have usually resulted in increased capacity utilization rates and international market prices for our paper products, leading to increased operating margins. These periods have often been followed by periods of capacity additions, which have resulted in declining capacity utilization rates and international selling prices, leading to declining operating margins. We expect that these cyclical trends in international selling prices and operating margins relating to global capacity shortfalls and additions will likely persist in the future, principally due to the continuing impact of four general factors:  cyclical trends in general business and economic activity produce swings in demand for paper and packaging products;  during periods of reduced demand, the high fixed cost structure of the capital intensive paper industry generally leads producers to compete aggressively on price in order to maximize capacity utilization;  significant capacity additions, whether through plant expansion or construction, can take two to three years to implement and are therefore necessarily based upon estimates of future demand; and  as competition in paper and packaging products is generally focused on price, being a low-cost producer is critical to improved profitability. This favors producers with larger plants that maximize economies of scale but construction of high capacity plants may result in significant increases in capacity that can outstrip demand growth. Since mid-1995, the North American paper and packaging industry has experienced a prolonged down cycle characterized by continued price pressures, excess capacity and the inability of many industry participants to earn satisfactory returns on capital. To maintain reasonable capacity utilization, U.S. paper producers have generally maintained high export levels over the past three years, including in the exports to Mexico. Capacity expansion plans in the North American paper and packaging industry have been reduced to their lowest levels in over 20 years. In addition, large amounts of capacity have been permanently closed since the beginning of 2001. Capacity Utilization Our operations have high fixed costs. Accordingly, to obtain low unit production costs and maintain adequate operating margins, we seek to maintain a high capacity utilization rate at all of our production facilities. 37 The table below sets forth capacity utilization rates with respect to the production facilities for some of our principal products for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Containerboard 100 % 99 % 99 % Newsprint and uncoated free sheet 96 % 93 % 94 % Corrugated containers 72 % 71 % 70 % Multi-wall sacks 66 % 59 % 56 % Effects of Fluctuations in Raw Materials Prices Fluctuations in the market price of OCC and ONP, which are the primary raw materials used in our paper making activities have significant effects on our costs of goods sold and the prices that we are able to charge our customers for our paper and packaging products. In addition, our cost of goods sold is significantly affected by energy costs. Recycled Fiber Costs OCC and ONP are the primary raw materials used in the production of our paper products. In 2005, OCC and ONP represented approximately 40% of the total cost of goods sold of our paper segment and approximately 30% of our consolidated cost of goods sold. The cost of OCC and ONP varies in accordance with international market prices, which fluctuate depending upon the supply of OCC and ONP and the demand for finished paper. Mexican OCC or ONP prices tend to follow price movements in the United States, but are generally lower because Mexican OCC or ONP is lower in quality. We believe that we are one of Mexicos largest users of recycled paper and operate recycling centers in the United States in Albuquerque and Phoenix. In 2005, approximately 39% of the OCC and ONP used in our United States paper production were collected by our recycling centers. We purchase the remainder of our OCC and ONP requirements in the open market. Because the primary raw material of our packaging segment is containerboard produced by our paper segment or other paper producers with cost structures similar to ours, fluctuations in the international market price of OCC and ONP result in similar fluctuations in the cost of the primary raw materials of the packaging segment. We attempt to revise the prices for our products, which are generally denominated in dollars or are dollar-linked, to reflect changes in the international market prices of these products, which in turn reflect fluctuations in the international market prices of OCC and ONP. However, as a result of the imbalance between supply of and demand for paper and packaging products, during 2003 we were not able to successfully pass through the increased prices of OCC and ONP to our customers. The international market price of OCC and ONP has fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect that it will continue to do so in the future. The international market price of OCC and ONP has been subject to significant upward pressures during the past several years as a result of significantly increased demand for OCC and ONP in Asia, particularly China. Significant increases in the price of OCC and ONP and, consequently, the cost of producing our products, reduces our gross margins and negatively affects our results of operations to the extent that we are unable to pass all of these increased costs on to our customers and could result in reduced sales volumes of our products. Conversely, significant decreases in the price of OCC and ONP and, consequently, the cost of producing our products, would likely increase our gross margins and our results of operations and could result in increased sales volumes if this lower cost leads us to lower our prices. We do not currently hedge our exposure to changes in the prices of OCC and ONP. Energy Costs 38 In 2005, energy cost represented approximately 19% of our cost of production. In particular, our paper mills consume significant amounts of electric power. We purchase approximately 70% of the electric power needs of our Mexican operations from the Federal Electricity Commission (Comisión Federal de Electricidad), the Mexican state-owned electric company, under long-term contracts and we produce the remainder at our own power plants. These long-term contracts guarantee the supply of electric power at prices that have historically increased by the Mexican inflation rate. In the United States, our McKinley mill is supplied 100% by a rural electric cooperative at formula prices under a long-term contract. Our U.S. converting facilities purchase electric power from local utilities. Mexican and United States Demand for Our Products We sell paper and packaging products in Mexico and the United States. The following is our geographic segment sales information for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in million of constant pesos) Mexico Ps 10,555.4 Ps 10,016.5 Ps 8,072.0 United States 2,291.4 2,358.6 2,072.7 Eliminations (4,703.5 ) (4,335.8 ) (2,817.4 ) Total Ps 8,143.3 Ps 8,039.3 Ps 7,327.3 In 2005:  approximately 68% of our net sales of paper to third parties was to customers in Mexico, and the remainder was to customers in the United States; and  approximately 88% of our net sales of packaging products to third parties was to customers in Mexico, and the remainder was to customers in the United States. As a Mexican company with most of our operations in Mexico, we are significantly affected by economic conditions in Mexico. Our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by the growth rate of Mexicos GDP because our products are used in the packaging of a wide range of consumer, agricultural, manufacturing and industrial products. In addition, because a significant portion of our operations are in the United States and a large portion of our packaging products are used in Mexico to package consumer, agricultural, manufacturing and industrial products destined for the United States, our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by the growth rate of the United States GDP. Mexican GDP growth has fluctuated significantly, and we anticipate that it will likely continue to do so. Mexican GDP grew by 1.4% in 2003, 4.2% in 2004 and 3.0% in 2005 . Our management believes that economic growth in Mexico would positively affect our future net sales and results of operations. However, a recession in Mexico would likely reduce our future net sales and negatively impact our results of operations. Effects of Fluctuations in Exchange Rates between the Peso and the Dollar Our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by the rate of depreciation or appreciation of the peso against the dollar because:  a substantial portion of our net sales are denominated in dollars or linked to dollars;  we have significant amounts of dollar-denominated liabilities that require us to make principal and interest payments in dollars;  the operations of our subsidiary, Durango McKinley Paper Company, are conducted in the United States; 39  our costs for some of our raw materials, principally imports of OCC and OPP to Mexico and certain chemicals required in our production processes, are incurred in dollars or are dollar-linked; and  we are permitted to deduct our foreign exchange losses in calculating our taxable income and, conversely, are required to treat foreign exchange gains as taxable income. Approximately 25% of our sales were made in dollars during 2005 with the balance primarily dollar-linked. Historically, costs of production in Mexico have been incurred in pesos, although substantially all of the costs and expenses of Durango McKinley Paper Company are incurred in dollars. During 2005, approximately 18% of our consolidated cost of goods sold was incurred in dollars or was dollar-linked. The primary dollar costs of our Mexican operations are incurred for imports of OCC and ONP. Fluctuations in the peso affect the cost of imported OCC and ONP and other dollar-linked or imported raw materials. The peso depreciated by 7.6% in 2003, appreciated by 0.8% against the dollar in 2004 and appreciated by 4.6% in 2005. Depreciation of the peso against the dollar generally results in our receiving more pesos for our dollar sales but our dollar-based costs increase. The net effect on our operating income is generally positive because the percentage of our net sales denominated in dollars or dollar-linked is significantly higher than the percentage of our costs and expenses that are denominated in dollars or dollar-linked. In addition, depreciation of the pesos against the dollar generally benefits Mexican traditional exporters and maquiladora exporters that consume our packaging products. Conversely, appreciation of the peso against the dollar generally results in our receiving fewer pesos for our dollar sales but our dollar-based costs decrease. The net effect on our operating income is generally negative because the percentage of our net sales denominated in dollars or dollar-linked is significantly higher than the percentage of our costs and expenses that are denominated in dollars or dollar-linked. In addition, appreciation of the peso against the dollar generally reduces the sales of Mexican traditional exporters and maquiladora exporters that consume our packaging products. At December 31, 2005, substantially all of our indebtedness was denominated in dollars. As a result, when the peso depreciates against the dollar:  the interest costs on our dollar-denominated indebtedness in pesos increases, which negatively affects our results of operations;  the amount of our dollar-denominated indebtedness in pesos increases, and our total liabilities in pesos increase; and  our financial expenses increase as a result of foreign exchange losses that we must record. For example, the 7.6% devaluation of the peso in 2003 substantially increased our financial expenses and were substantial factors in our net losses for those years. Conversely, when the peso appreciates against the dollar:  the interest costs on our dollar-denominated indebtedness in pesos decreases, which positively affects our results of operations;  the amount of our dollar-denominated indebtedness in pesos decreases, and our total liabilities in pesos decrease; and  our financial expenses tend to decrease as a result of foreign exchange gains that we must record. We do not have in place hedging arrangements with respect to devaluation risk because we do not believe them to be cost effective for our company. 40 Effects of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by the rate of inflation in Mexico because:  most of our costs and expenses are incurred in pesos in Mexico and are subject to inflationary pressures while most of our sales are denominated in dollars or are dollar-linked and are made at prices set by reference to international market prices; and  our monetary assets and liabilities are restated to give effect to the rate of Mexican inflation, as expressed by the NCPI, and as a result we record monetary position gains and losses that depend on our net monetary asset (liability) position and the rate of Mexican inflation. A component of our net comprehensive financing cost includes our gain or loss from monetary position, which refers to the gains or losses, due to the effects of inflation, from holding net monetary liabilities or assets. A gain from monetary position results from holding net monetary liabilities during periods of inflation as the purchasing power represented by nominal peso liabilities declines over time. Accordingly, since our monetary liabilities, including debt and other payables, exceeded our monetary assets, including cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable, in 2003, 2004 and 2005 we recorded a gain from monetary position for those periods. The table below shows Mexican inflation according to the NCPI and our gain on monetary position for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions of constant pesos, except percentages) Inflation 3.3 % 5.2 % 4.0 % Gain from monetary position Ps 198.7 Ps 469.4 Ps 399.5 Effect of Taxes on Our Income In accordance with Mexican tax law, we are subject to federal income tax, tax on assets and employee statutory profit sharing. Income Taxes and Employee Statutory Profit Sharing The income tax rate was 34% in 2003, 33% in 2004 and 30% in 2005. Mexican income taxes take into consideration the taxable and deductible effects of inflation. As a result of an amendment to the Income Tax Law that became effective on November 13, 2004, the income tax rate will be 29% and 28% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. These reductions in the income tax rate resulted in a decrease in the value of our deferred income tax liability of Ps 23.3 million in 2004 and Ps 17.2 million in 2005, which increases were charged to income tax benefit (expenses) in our statement of operations. Like other Mexican companies, we are required by law to pay our employees, in addition to their agreed compensation and benefits, profit sharing in an aggregate amount equal to 10% of our taxable income (calculated without reference to inflation adjustments). Prior to 2002, the payment of employee statutory profit sharing was deductible in certain instances. This deduction was completely eliminated in 2002, but is scheduled to be reinstated in 2006. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences resulting from comparing the book and tax values of assets and liabilities plus any future benefits from tax loss carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by any benefits about which there is uncertainty as to their realizability. Asset Taxes Taxes on assets are calculated by applying a rate of 1.8% on the net average of the majority of our restated assets less certain liabilities and is payable only to the extent that it exceeds income tax payable for the applicable period. 41 If in any year the asset tax exceeds the income tax payable, the asset tax payment for such excess may be reduced by the amount by which income taxes exceeded asset taxes in the three preceding years and any required payment of asset taxes may be credited against the excess of income taxes over asset taxes of the following ten years. The asset taxes paid that are expected to be recoverable are recorded as an advance payment of income taxes and decrease the deferred income tax liability on our balance sheet. Tax Loss Carryforwards and Recoverable Asset Taxes Tax loss carryforwards and recoverable asset taxes for which the deferred income tax asset and prepaid income tax, respectively, have been partially recognized may be recovered subject to certain conditions. Due to a deterioration in the circumstances used to assess the realization of the benefit of tax loss carryforwards and recovery of tax on assets paid, the valuation allowance for benefit of tax loss carryforwards and recoverable tax on assets was increased by Ps 183.2 million in 2005 and Ps 181.4 million in 2004 and charged to results of operations. Restated amounts as of December 31, 2005 and expiration dates are: Tax Loss Recoverable Year of expiration Carryforwards Asset Taxes (millions of constant pesos) 2006 Ps 158.3 Ps 28.6 2007 107.6 28.4 2008 149.2 27.5 2009 70.6 21.5 2010 63.6 25.9 2011 87.2 24.1 2012 361.2 64.1 2013 1,128.2 59.7 2014 384.3 6.4 2015 1,038.0 1.0 Total Ps 3,548.2 Ps 287.2 Recent Developments Recapitalization of Series A Shares and Series B Shares On January 25, 2006 and February 20, 2006, respectively, our board of directors and shareholders approved a recapitalization of our company under which we created a new sole series of common stock, no par value, and each of our outstanding Series A Shares and Series B Shares will be converted into one newly issued share of common stock. Following this recapitalization:  each of our outstanding CPOs will represent a financial interest in one share of our common stock;  each of our outstanding ADSs will continue to represent two CPOs; and  we expect that our common stock will be listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. We expect that the new common stock will be publicly traded over the Mexican Stock Exchange, subject to the approval of the CNBV and to the registration of the new common stock with the National Stock Registry of the CNBV. If approved and registered by the CNBV, we expect that the recapitalization and public trading of the new common stock will become effective within 15 days following the date on which the CNBV grants its approval. Debt Reduction Program On February 27, 2006, we announced a debt reduction program to be undertaken during 2006. As of June 27, 2006, we have prepaid US$66.4 million of our outstanding debt and made amortization and payments at maturity of 42 an additional US$4 million. The following are the most significant pre-payments made under this debt redection program:  we have prepaid US$47.0 million to Bancomext under certain outstanding loan agreements;  we have prepaid US$10.0 million to Bank of Albuquerque, representing the full amount outstanding under our loan agreement with Bank of Albuquerque;  we have prepaid US$4.8 million to GE Capital Leasing under our capital leases, representing the full amount outstanding under these leases; and  we have prepaid US$4.6 million to GE Capital Corporation under an outstanding capital lease. We have financed these prepayments through the issuance and sale of capital stock of Pipsamex to our majority stockholders, the proceeds from the divestiture of some minor non-strategic assets and operating cash flow. Pipsamex Capital Increase On March 6, 2006, Pipsamex issued and sold 2,177,042,255 shares of its series B capital stock, representing 13.3% of Pipsamex outstanding capital stock to NKM Corporativo, S.A. de C.V., a company owned and controlled by the Rincón family, for Ps 314.6 million. The proceeds of this sale were used to fund our debt reduction program. Tizayuca Mill Lease Agreement On March 31, 2006, we purchased land and an industrial facility in Tizayuca, Hidalgo at which a paper mill and converter are located for US$10.0 million. Effective March 31, 2006, we entered into an operating lease agreement under which we lease machinery and equipment with installed capacity of 200,000 short tons of linerboard and 100,000 short tons of corrugated boxes located at the Tizayuca industrial facility. The lease agreement has a term of 7.5 years and requires payments over its term of US$66.0 million. We have an option to purchase the machinery and equipment for fair market value on the seventh anniversary of the commencement of this lease. Results of Operations The following discussion of our results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Mexican GAAP. The discussion of the results of our business segments is based upon financial information reported for each of the three segments of our business, as detailed in note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In the following discussion, references to increases or decreases in any year are made by comparison with the corresponding prior year, except as the context otherwise indicates. The following table sets forth consolidated financial information for each of the three years ended December 31, 2005.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions of constant pesos, except percentages) Paper Sales to third parties Ps 3,490.1 Ps 3,554.5 Ps 2,987.6 Intersegment sales 4,199.8 4,029.7 2,655.0 Total sales 7,689.8 7,584.2 5,642.6 Operating income (loss) 122.5 55.5 (122.6 ) Operating margin (%) 3.5 % 1.6 % (4.1 )% Depreciation and amortization 276.6 293.1 285.7 Packaging Sales to third parties Ps 4,552.8 Ps 4,374.2 Ps 4,251.0 Intersegment sales 413.3 306.0 144.9 Total sales 4,966.2 4,680.2 4,395.9 Operating income 236.7 398.9 467.5 Operating margin (%) 5.2 % 9.1 % 11.0 % Depreciation and amortization 133.4 137.4 128.8 Other Sales to third parties Ps 100.4 Ps 110.5 Ps 88.7 Intersegment sales 90.4 0.1 17.5 Total sales 190.8 110.6 106.2 Operating income (loss) 10.1 1.2 (15.8 ) Operating margin (%) 10.0 % 1.1 % (17.8 )% Depreciation and amortization 11.6 7.7 12.0 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales Net sales increased by 1.3% in 2005, primarily due to the 4.1% increase of net sales to third parties of our packaging segment. The effect of this increase was partially offset by the 1.8% decrease of net sales to third parties of our paper segment and the 9.2% decrease of net sales to third parties of our other segment. Net sales to third parties of our packaging segment increased by 4.1% in 2005, primarily as a result of: 44  a 3.1% increase in net sales to third parties of corrugated containers, principally due to a 5.2% increase in our sales volume of corrugated containers, the effects of which were partially offset by a 2.0% decline in our average sales price for corrugated containers; and  a 12.0% increase in net sales to third parties of multi-wall sacks, principally due to a 5.4% increase in our sales volume of multi-wall sacks and a 6.2% increase in our average sales price for multi-wall sacks. Net sales to third parties of our paper segment decreased by 1.8% in 2005, due to:  a 12.3% decrease in net sales to third parties of containerboard, principally due to a 12.7% decrease in our average sales price for containerboard, the effects of which were partially offset by a 0.4% increase in our sales volume of containerboard; and  to a lesser extent, a 2.0% decrease in net sales to third parties of newsprint, principally due to a 9.9% decrease in our sales volume of newsprint, the effects of which were partially offset by an 8.9% increase in our average sales price for newsprint. The effects of these decreases was partially offset by a 14.6% increase in net sales to third parties of uncoated free sheet, principally due to a 4.3% increase in our average sales price for uncoated free sheet and a 9.8% increase in our sales volume of uncoated free sheet. Net sales to third parties of our other segment decreased by 9.2% in 2005, primarily due to 16.9% decrease in our sales volume of our other products. The effects of this decrease were partially offset by a 9.3% increase in our average sales price for our other products. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased by 3.0% in 2005, primarily due to increased sales volumes of packaging products. Average prices for recycled fiber, consisting of OCC and ONP, which accounted for approximately 30% of our cost of goods sold in 2005, increased by 15.9% in nominal dollar terms to US$169 per short ton in 2005 from US$146 per short ton in 2004. Our energy cost, which represented approximately 19% of our cost of production in 2005, increased by 11.9%, primarily as a result of increased production volumes and increased prices for energy. On a unit cost basis, energy cost increased by 9% in 2005. Our labor cost, which represented approximately 11% of our cost of production in 2005, decreased by 1%, primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of our employees at the higher end of our wage scale. On a unit cost basis, labor costs decreased by 3% in 2005. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit decreased by 8.9% in 2005, primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales of our paper and other segments. Gross margin decreased to 12.9% in 2005 compared to 14.3% in 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 2.4% in 2005, and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales decreased to 8.3% in 2005 compared to 8.6% in 2004, primarily as a result of our greater control of our selling, general and administrative expenses which decreased despite our increased net sales. Operating Income Operating income decreased by 19.0% in 2005, primarily as a result of the 8.9% decrease in our gross profit that principally resulted from our increased cost of sales. Operating margin declined to 4.5% in 2005 compared to 5.7% in 2004. 45 Operating income in our paper segment increased to Ps 122.5 million in 2005 from Ps 55.5 million in 2004. Operating margin of this segment increased to 3.5% in 2005 compared to 1.6% in 2004, principally due to price increases for newsprint and uncoated free sheet that exceeded the increases in the unit costs of these products. Operating income in our packaging segment decreased by 40.7%, primarily as a result of the decline in the average prices of our packaging products in 2005. Operating margin of this segment declined to 5.2% in 2005 compared to 9.1% in 2004, principally due to the decline in the average price of corrugated cartons. Operating income in our other segment was Ps 10.1 million in 2005 compared to Ps 1.2 million in 2004, primarily as a result of higher average prices for our other products. Operating margin of this segment increased to 10.0% in 2005 compared to 1.1% in 2004. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income, net was Ps 5.2 million in 2005 compared to other expense, net of Ps 417.9 million in 2004. In 2005, other income, net arose primarily as a result of a Ps 113.8 million gain recorded as a result of the revaluation of long-lived assets in use at five of our mills and plants. The effect of this gain, was partially offset by a Ps 65.7 million restructuring expense recorded in 2005 in connection with our financial restructuring. In 2004, other expenses  net arose primarily as a result of:  a Ps 479.1 million expense recorded as a result of the impairment of long-lived assets in use at five of our mills and plants;  a Ps 333.5 million expense recorded as a result of the amortization in full of the debt issuance expenses relating to our 2003 notes, 2006 notes, 2008 notes and 2009 notes; and  a Ps 149.4 million restructuring expense recorded in 2004 in connection with our financial restructuring. These expenses were partially offset by other income of Ps 641.5 million we recorded as a result of our purchase of notes issued by our company in the aggregate principal amount of US$48.1 million (Ps 554.2 million) for US$7.5 million (Ps 88.9 million). Net Comprehensive Financing Cost Net comprehensive financing cost decreased by 97.2% in 2005, primarily due to (1) a 48.9% decrease in interest expense in 2005, principally as a result of the restructuring of a portion of our outstanding debt in February 2005, which reduced the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our debt and the average applicable interest rate, and (2) an increase in our foreign exchange gain to Ps 334.6 million in 2005 compared to Ps 62.6 million in 2004 as a result of a 4.6% appreciation of the peso in 2005 compared to the 0.8% appreciation of the peso in 2004. These effects were partially offset by a 57.7% decrease in monetary position gain in 2005, principally due to the reduction of Mexican inflation to 3.3% in 2005 compared to 5.2% in 2004, and the reduction of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our debt. Income Tax and Employee Statutory Profit Sharing Benefit (Expenses) Income tax and employee statutory profit sharing expense was Ps 304.7 million in 2005 as compared to a benefit of Ps 502.7 million in 2004, principally due to tax benefits accrued in 2004 as a result of the impairment of certain of our long-lived assets. Our effective tax rate decreased to 84.9% in 2005 compared to 94.4% in 2004. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations increased by 3.1% in 2005. In 2004 and 2005, our discontinued operations were the operations of our Chihuahua particleboard mill, which we sold on July 15, 2005. In 2005, income from discontinued operations was composed of: 46  income of Ps 59.3 million generated by our discontinued operations;  a Ps 65.2 million income tax and employee statutory profit sharing benefit recorded with respect to our discontinued operations; and  a Ps 15.8 million loss recorded on the sale of our Chihuahua particleboard plant. In 2004, income from discontinued operations was composed of:  income of Ps 70.4 million generated by our discontinued operations; and  a Ps 35.2 million income tax and employee statutory profit sharing benefit recorded with respect to our discontinued operations. Consolidated Net Income Net income was Ps 163.9 million in 2005 compared to Ps 63.9 million in 2004. Net income as a percentage of net sales increased to 2.0% in 2005 compared to 0.8% in 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Sales Net sales increased by 9.7% in 2004 due to:  the 19.0% increase of net sales to third parties of our paper segment;  the 2.9% increase of net sales to third parties of our packaging segment; and  the 24.7% increase of net sales to third parties of our other segment. Net sales to third parties of our paper segment increased by 19.0% in 2004 due to:  a 25.8% increase in net sales to third parties of containerboard, principally due to a 15.2% increase in our average sales price for containerboard and a 9.3% increase in our sales volume of containerboard;  a 30.1% increase in net sales to third parties of newsprint, principally due to a 20.9% increase in our sales volume of newsprint and a 7.7% increase in our average sales price for newsprint; and  a 2.2% increase in net sales to third parties of uncoated free sheet, principally due to a 5.1% increase in our average sales price for uncoated free sheet, which was partially offset by a 2.7% decrease in our sales volume of uncoated free sheet. Net sales to third parties of our packaging segment increased by 2.9% in 2004, primarily as a result of:  a 2.5% increase in net sales to third parties of corrugated containers, principally due to a 2.7% increase in our sales volume of corrugated containers, the effects of which were partially offset by a 0.2% decline in our average sales price for corrugated containers; and  an 8.7% increase in net sales to third parties of multi-wall sacks, principally due to a 11.0% increase in our sales volume of multi-wall sacks, the effects of which were partially offset by a 2.1% decline in our average sales price for multi-wall sacks. 47 Net sales to third parties of our other segment increased by 24.7% in 2004, primarily due to a 15.2% increase in our average sales price for our other products and an 8.2% increase in our sales volume of our other products. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased by 9.4% in 2004, primarily due to increased sales volumes of paper products. Average prices for recycled fiber, consisting of OCC and ONP, which accounted for approximately 30% of our cost of sales in 2004, increased by 17.7% in nominal dollar terms to US$146 per short ton in 2004 from US$124 per short ton in 2003. Our energy cost, which represented approximately 17% of our cost of production in 2004, increased by 10.1%, primarily as a result of increased production volumes and increased prices for energy. On a unit cost basis, energy cost increased by 4% in 2004. Our labor cost, which represented approximately 12% of our cost of production in 2004, increased by 4%, primarily as a result of increases in wages paid to our employees. On a unit cost basis, labor costs decreased by 2% in 2004. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit increased by 11.9% in 2004, primarily as a result of the increase in net sales of our paper and packaging segments. Gross margin increased to 14.3% in 2004 compared to 14.0% in 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses remained stable at Ps 694.1 million in 2004 compared to Ps 698.2 million in 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales decreased to 8.6% in 2004 compared to 9.5% in 2003 as a result of our greater control of our selling, general and administrative expenses which remained stable despite our increased net sales. Operating Income Operating income increased by 38.4% in 2004, primarily as a result of the 11.9% increase in our gross profit that principally resulted from our increased net sales. Operating margin increased to 5.7% in 2004 compared to 4.5% in 2003. Operating income in our paper segment was Ps 55.5 million compared to operating loss of Ps 122.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of the increase in average sales prices of our paper products and this segments increased net sales in 2004. Operating margin of this segment increased to 1.6% in 2004 compared to (4.1)% in 2003, principally due to price increases for containerboard and newsprint and uncoated free sheet that exceeded the increases in the unit costs of these products. Operating income in our packaging segment decreased by 14.7%, primarily as a result of the decline in the average prices of our packaging products, partially offset by the increased sales of this segment. Operating margin of this segment declined to 9.1% in 2004 compared to 11.0% in 2003, principally due to increases in the unit costs of corrugated containers. Operating income in our other segment was Ps 1.2 million compared to operating loss of Ps 15.8 million in 2003, primarily as a result of higher average prices for our other products and this segments increased net sales in 2004. Operating margin of this segment increased to 1.1% in 2004 compared to (17.8)% in 2003. Other Expenses  Net Other expenses  net decreased by 74.5% in 2004. In 2004, other expenses  net arose primarily as a result of:  a Ps 479.1 million expense recorded as a result of the impairment of long-lived assets in use at five of our mills and plants;  a Ps 333.5 million expense recorded as a result of the amortization in full of the debt issuance expenses relating to our 2003 notes, 2006 notes, 2008 notes and 2009 notes; and 48  a Ps 149.4 million restructuring expense recorded in 2004 in connection with our financial restructuring. These expenses were partially offset by other income of Ps 641.5 million we recorded as a result of our purchase of notes issued by our company in the aggregate principal amount of US$48.1 million (Ps 554.2 million) for US$7.5 million (Ps 88.9 million). In 2003, other expenses  net arose primarily as a result of:  a Ps 656.1 million expense recorded as a result of the impairment of long-lived assets in use at five of our mills and plants;  a Ps 342.5 million expense recorded as a result of our assumption of the Bank of America, N.A. loan agreement and the JPMorgan letters of credit relating to the call of our guarantees of these instruments following the defaults on these instruments by Durango Georgia Receivables Company and Durango Paper Company, respectively;  a Ps 296.6 million restructuring expense recorded in 2003 in connection with our financial restructuring, including our payment of US$12.0 million in fees related to certain forbearance agreements; and  a Ps 217.0 million expense reflecting our loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment, principally the sale of Grupo Pipsamexs warehouse in Mexico City. Net Comprehensive Financing Cost Net comprehensive financing cost decreased by 66.3% in 2003, primarily due to (1) the Ps 62.6 million foreign exchange gain we recorded in 2004 compared to the Ps 892.8 million foreign exchange loss we recorded in 2003 as a result of a 0.8% appreciation of the peso in 2004 as compared to a 7.6% depreciation of the peso in 2003, and (2) a 10.1% decrease in interest expense in 2004, primarily as a result of our ceasing to accrue interest on our outstanding unsecured debt after the Mexican court declared us to be in commercial reorganization under the LCM on August 25, 2004, the effect of which was partially offset by our accrual of interest on this debt at default rates in 2004 prior to August 25, 2004. Income Tax and Employee Statutory Profit Sharing Benefit Income tax and employee statutory profit sharing benefit was Ps 502.7 million in 2004 as compared to Ps 0.4 million in 2003, principally due to the change in the valuation allowance for recoverable deferred income tax assets and recoverable tax on assets. Our effective tax rate increased to 94.5% in 2004 compared to 0.02% in 2003. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was Ps 105.5 million in 2004 compared to loss from discontinued operations of Ps 597.0 million in 2003. In 2004, our discontinued operations were the operations of our Chihuahua particleboard mill, which were held for sale at December 31, 2004. In 2003, our discontinued operations were:  the operations of our molded pulp division, which we sold for US$53.7 million on February 27, 2003;  the operations of Pronal, which we sold for US$28.0 million on November 14, 2003; and  the operations of our Chihuahua particleboard mill, which were held for sale at December 31, 2003. In 2004, income from discontinued operations was composed of:  income of Ps 70.4 million generated by our discontinued operations; and 49  a Ps 35.2 million income tax and employee statutory profit sharing benefit recorded with respect to our discontinued operations. In 2003, loss from discontinued operations was composed of:  a Ps 612.9 million loss incurred by our discontinued operations, including a Ps 381.8 million impairment charge assessed against the Chihuahua particleboard mill;  a Ps 486.4 million loss recorded on the sale of Pronal;  a Ps 364.1 million gain recorded on the sale of our molded pulp division; and  a Ps 138.2 million income tax and employee statutory profit sharing benefit recorded with respect to our discontinued operations. Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Net income was Ps 63.9 million in 2004 compared to net loss of Ps 3,640.8 million in 2003. Net income as a percentage of net sales was to 0.8% in 2004 compared to a net loss as a percentage of net sales of 49.7% in 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal cash requirements consist of the following:  working capital requirements;  servicing our indebtedness; and  capital expenditures related to investments in operations, major maintenance and expansion of plant facilities. Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of:  cash flows from operating activities;  short-term and long-term borrowings; and  sales of debt securities in domestic and international capital markets. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of Ps 700.4 million and Ps 859.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had working capital of Ps 2,018.0 million and Ps 2,104.5 million, respectively. We believe that cash generated by our operating activities will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future operating performance and our ability to service our debt are subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Changes in Financial Position Net Resources Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Operating activities provided net resources of Ps 143.1 million in 2005, Ps 849.0 million in 2004 and used net resources of Ps 482.6 million in 2003. The significant factors that led to the provision of net resources by operating 50 activities in 2005 were our consolidated net income from continuing operations of Ps 55.1 million, net of items not requiring or providing resources, principally:  depreciation and amortization of Ps 421.6 million;  deferred income tax expense of Ps 241.1 million, primarily as a result of the revaluation of long-lived assets in use at five of our mills and plants; and  a Ps 113.8 million gain as a result of the revaluation of long-lived assets in use at five of our mills and plants. These effects were supplemented by (1) a Ps 92.2 million decrease in other current assets, and (2) a Ps 90.4 million increase in trade accounts payable. The effects of these items were partially offset by:  a Ps 307.7 million loss from discontinued operations, net of items that did not require resources;  a Ps 135.6 million decrease in accrued expenses and taxes, other than income taxes;  a Ps 100.2 million decrease in other liabilities, net; and  a Ps 90.0 million increase in inventories. The significant factors that led to the provision of net resources by operating activities in 2004 were our consolidated loss from continuing operations of Ps 41.6 million, net of items not requiring or providing resources, principally:  impairment of long-lived assets of Ps 479.1 million related to five of our mills and plants;  depreciation and amortization of Ps 438.2 million,  amortization of debt-issuance cost of Ps 338.1 million related to our 2003 notes, 2006 notes, 2008 notes and 2009 notes as a result of our financial restructuring, and  deferred income tax benefit of Ps 531.3 million, primarily as a result of the impairment of our long-lived assets. These effects were supplemented by (1) a Ps 135.6 million decrease in trade accounts receivables, net, primarily as a result of greater efficiency in our collection process, (2) net income of discontinued operations, net of items not requiring the use of resources, of Ps 105.5 million, and (3) a Ps 73.2 million decrease in inventories. The effects of these items were partially offset by a Ps 222.7 million decrease in trade accounts payable. The significant factors that led to the use of net resources from operating activities in 2003 were our consolidated net loss of Ps 3,043.8 million, net of items not requiring or providing resources, principally:  impairment of long-lived assets of Ps 656.1 million related to five of our mills and plants;  depreciation and amortization of Ps 426.4 million;  loss related to Durango Paper Company of Ps 342.5 million; and  loss on sale of property, plant and equipment of Ps 217.0 million principally related to the sale of Grupo Pipsamexs warehouse in Mexico City. The effects of our net loss were supplemented by (1) net loss of discontinued operations, net of items not requiring the use of resources, of Ps 194.3 million, (2) a Ps 98.3 million increase in trade accounts receivable, net principally 51 as a result of the increase in recoverable taxes; and (3) a Ps 88.3 million decrease in other liabilities, net resulting from an increase in deferred income of Grupo Pipsamex. The effects of these items were partially offset by:  a Ps 998.3 million increase in interest payable as a result of our failure to pay interest payments due on our unsecured indebtedness during 2003;  a Ps 93.6 million increase in trade accounts payable resulting from our decision to delay payments to certain of our trade creditors in order to conserve our cash resources;  a Ps 81.9 million increase in liabilities of discontinued operations; and  a Ps 52.5 million decrease in inventories, principally resulting from a decrease in spare parts and finished products. Net Resources Used in Financing Activities Financing activities used net resources of Ps 555.1 million in 2005, Ps 625.7 million in 2004 and Ps 60.7 million in 2003. In 2005, net resources used in financing activities on a consolidated basis primarily consisted of (1) a Ps 3,989.0 million decrease in short-term and long-term debt, partially offset by (2) a Ps 290.7 million increase in capital stock and a Ps 2,973.7 million increase in additional paid-in capital, reflecting the effects of our issuance of Series B Shares in connection with our financial restructuring. These effects were supplemented by payments of long-term debt of Ps 170.5 million, primarily payments on our capital leases and secured debt. In 2004, net resources used in financing activities on a consolidated basis primarily consisted of payments of Ps 798.9 million of long-term debt, primarily payments on our capital leases and secured debt. The effects of these payments were partially offset by the incurrence of Ps 101.1 million of short-term and long-term debt, primarily as a result of the effects of the application of inflation accounting. In 2003, net resources used in financing activities on a consolidated basis primarily consisted of payments of Ps 441.3 million on our long-term debt, primarily payments on our capital leases and secured debt. The effects of these payments were partially offset by the incurrence of Ps 282.0 million of short-term and long-term debt, primarily as a result of the effects of the application of inflation accounting. Net Resources Generated by (Used in) Investing Activities Investing activities generated net resources of Ps 248.5 million in 2005, used net resources of Ps 61.4 million in 2004, and generated net resources of Ps 990.4 million in 2003. In 2005, net resources generated by investing activities on a consolidated basis primarily consisted of (1) Ps 334.4 million received as proceeds from the sale of our Chihuahua particleboard plant, and (2) Ps 74.8 million received as proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The effects of these transactions were partially offset by (1) Ps 134.8 million of acquisitions of machinery and equipment, and (2) Ps 54.0 million of investment in subsidiaries. In 2004, net resources used in investing activities on a consolidated basis primarily consisted of our acquisition of machinery and equipment for Ps 214.2 million. The effects of these transactions were partially offset by the termination of restrictions placed on Ps 171.2 million of the proceeds of the sales of Pronal and Grupo Pipsamexs Mexico City warehouse as a result of the prepayment of a portion of our indebtedness to Bancomext in connection with the restructuring of our debt to Bancomext on September 30, 2004. In 2003, net resources generated by investing activities on a consolidated basis primarily consisted of (1) Ps 1,005.0 million received as proceeds from the sale of our molded products division and Pronal, and (2) Ps 251.2 million received as proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily Grupo Pipsamexs Mexico City warehouse. The effects of these transactions were partially offset by the restrictions placed on Ps 171.2 million of the proceeds of the sales of Pronal and Grupo Pipsamexs Mexico City warehouse and our acquisition of machinery and equipment for Ps 114.7 million. 52 Indebtedness At December 31, 2005, our total outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis was Ps 6,762.7 million, consisting of Ps 257.6 million of short-term indebtedness, including current portion of long-term indebtedness (or 3.8% of our total indebtedness), and Ps 6,505.1 million of long-term indebtedness (or 96.2% of our total indebtedness). All of our indebtedness at December 31, 2005 was denominated in foreign currencies. The weighted average interest rate on our indebtedness was 7.6% at December 31, 2005, 7.3% at December 31, 2004 without giving effect to our financial restructuring, and 10.8% at December 31, 2003. Short-Term Indebtedness At December 31, 2005, we have no outstanding short-term indebtedness, other than the current porion of our long-term indebtedness. Long-Term Indebtedness The following table sets forth selected information with respect to certain of our principal outstanding long-term debt instruments at December 31, 2005.

We expect to prepay the remaining outstanding amounts under this lease agreement in connection with our pending sale of the business jet. Restrictive Covenants and Available Credit The instruments governing our indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that restrict, among other things, the ability of our company and most of our subsidiaries to:  incur additional indebtedness;  incur liens;  issue guarantees;  issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries;  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments;  consummate certain asset sales;  enter into certain transactions with affiliates; or  merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. The Common Agreement for the benefit of the holders of our 2012 notes and creditors under the Restructured Credit Agreement also requires prepayments of the indebtedness from the proceeds from certain asset sales, insurance, and incurrence of certain indebtedness. Our failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the Common Agreement constitutes an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. We must maintain minimum debt service, minimum net worth and maximum leverage ratios under the Restructured Credit Agreement, and the Bank of Albuquerque loan agreement. Our failure to comply with these restrictions constitutes an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. The above covenants, together with our highly leveraged position, have restricted, and will continue to restrict, our corporate activities, including our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital expenditures or to take advantage of business opportunities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently have any transactions involving off-balance sheet arrangements. 55 Contractual Commitments and Capital Expenditures Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005 that have an impact on our liquidity: Payments Due by Period Less than One Year One to Three Years Three to Five Years More than Five Years Total (millions of constant pesos) Indebtedness Ps 235.4 Ps 533.6 Ps 477.1 Ps 5,408.2 Ps 6,654.3 Interest on indebtedness (1) 524.7 1,604.9 973.7 454.2 3,557.5 Capital leases 22.2 80.7 5.5  108.4 Operating leases (2) 107.0 162.1 99.7 24.9 393.7 Notes payable 48.3 49.4 14.4  112.0 Total contractual obligations Ps 937.6 Ps 2,430.7 Ps 1,570.4 Ps 5,887.3 Ps 10,825.9 (1) Consists of estimated future payments of interest on our indebtedness, calculated based on interest rates and foreign exchange rates applicable at December 31, 2005 and assuming that all amortization payments and payments at maturity on our indebtedness will be made on their scheduled payment dates.

Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment were Ps 134.8 million in 2005, Ps 214.2 million in 2004 and Ps 114.7 million in 2003. Our principal capital expenditures projects during 2003 through 2005 included:  Ps 152.0 million for the installation of Durango McKinley Paper Companys BHS corrugating plant in Dallas, Texas, which was completed in 2003;  Ps 159.3 million in 2004 for the purchase of printers for the packaging division and machinery and equipment for our paper mills, which increased our annual containerboard capacity by 57,000 short tons; and  Ps 110.9 million in 2005 for the purchase of printers for the packaging division and machinery and equipment for our paper mills. We have instituted a capital investment program to help our overall operations and have implemented a series of measures to improve efficiency and to increase capacity at our paper mills. In addition, we have made capital expenditures to bring our plants into proper compliance with environmental regulations with the latest technology. 56 The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods indicated and sets forth our capital expenditures and capital commitments for environmental matters: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2003 2004 2005 Estimated Estimated (in millions of constant pesos) Capital expenditures (other than environmental) Ps 109.1 Ps 200.0 Ps 122.8 Ps 183.5 Ps 200.0 Environmental capital expenditures 5.6 14.2 12.0 16.5 10.0 Total Ps 114.7 Ps 214.2 Ps 134.8 Ps 200.0 Ps 210.0 Our loan agreements and the Common Agreement governing the Restructured Credit Agreement and the 2012 notes contain significant restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures. We currently are budgeting total capital expenditures of approximately Ps 200.0 million for 2006 and Ps 210.0 million for 2007. Our principal capital expenditures for 2006 consist of efficiency enhancement projects and cost reduction projects. We expect to finance our capital expenditure plan with internally generated cash and supplier financing. No assurance can be given that we will be able to meet our capital expenditure budget. Differences between Mexican GAAP and U.S. GAAP Our audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Mexican GAAP. Mexican GAAP differs in significant respects from U.S. GAAP. For more information about the differences between Mexican GAAP and U.S. GAAP and a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP of our consolidated net income (loss) and total stockholders equity as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, see note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements. It should be noted that our reconciliation to U.S. GAAP does not include the reversal of the restatement of the financial statements as required by Bulletin B-10, Recognition of the Effects of Inflation in the Financial Information, since the application of this bulletin represents a comprehensive measure of the effects of price-level changes in the Mexican economy and, as such, is considered a more meaningful presentation than historical cost-based financial reporting in Mexican pesos for both Mexican and U.S. accounting purposes. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2004, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock (EITF 02-14). EITF 02-14 addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means. EITF 02-14 states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in-substance common stock of a corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The accounting provisions of EITF 02-14 are effective for reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF 02-14 is not expected to have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 57 In June 2005, the FASB published SFAS No. 154, Accounting changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS No. 154), which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects of the cumulative effect of the change. This Statement also carries forward without change the guidance contained in Opinion 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate. This Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncement. SFAS No. 154 will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company is currently considering the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated results and financial position. SFAS No.155 Accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments-and amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 issued on February 2006. This Statement amends FASB Statements No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This Statement resolves issues addressed in Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. This Statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement 133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. This Statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Companys management is in the process of determining the potential impact of adopting this Standard on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. SFAS No. 156 Accounting for servicing of financial assets-an amendment of FASB Statement No.140 issued on March 2006. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This Statement requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. This Statement permits, but does not require, the subsequent measurement of servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value. This Statement permits an entity to reclassify certain available-for-sale securities to trading securities, regardless of the restriction in paragraph 15 of Statement 115, provided that those available-for-sale securities are identified in some manner as offsetting the entitys exposure to changes in fair value of servicing assets or servicing liabilities that a servicer elects to subsequently measure at fair value. This option is available only once, as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the entity adopts this Statement. An entity should adopt this Statement as of the beginning of its first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year, provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements, including interim financial statements, for any period of that fiscal year. The effective date of this Statement is the date an entity adopts the requirements of this Statement. An entity should apply the requirements for recognition and initial measurement of servicing assets and servicing liabilities prospectively to all transactions after the effective date of this Statement. The Companys management is in the process of determining the potential impact of adopting this Standard on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 58 Item 6.

Banamex Trust On February 24, 2005, the Banamex Trust was established by Miguel Rincón, José Antonio Rincón, Jesús Rincón, Wilfrido Rincón, Ignacio Rincón and Martín Rincón, as settlors and beneficiaries. The settlors contributed an aggregate of 15,911,511 Series A Shares to the Banamex Trust.

Under the agreement governing the Banamex Trust, each settlor is entitled to instruct the trustee of the Banamex Trust with respect to the voting of the Series A Shares contributed to the Banamex Trust by that settlor unless an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the pledge agreement between the Banamex Trust and Banamex. The pledge agreement permits Banamex to cause the Banamex Trust to sell all or part of the Series A Shares held by the Banamex Trust if the price of the Series A Shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange meets or exceeds the peso equivalent of US$1.50. Banamex may exercise this right at any time whether or not an event of default under the pledge agreement has occurred. All proceeds from any such sale are to be paid to Banamex and applied against ACMs obligations under the ACM Loan. ACM Pledge ACM granted a pledge in favor of Banamex over the all of the Series A Shares that ACM owns to secure ACMs obligations under the ACM Loan.

All proceeds from any such sale are to be paid to Banamex and applied against ACMs obligations under the ACM Loan. CPO Trust Certain Series A Shares are held in trust by Nacional Financiera S.N.C., or NAFIN, as the trustee of a trust, which we refer to as the CPO Trust, established under a trust agreement dated November 24, 1989 between NAFIN as the grantor and as trustee for the benefit of the holders of certain Ordinary Participation Certificates, or CPOs issued by the trustee. Each CPO represents an interest in one share of Series A Common Stock held in the CPO Trust. The CPO Trust and the CPOs issued under the trust agreement will expire on November 24, 2019. Holders of CPOs are not entitled to exercise any voting rights with respect to the Series A Shares held in the CPO Trust. Such voting rights are exercisable only by the trustee, which is required by the terms of the trust agreement to vote such Series A Shares in the same manner as the majority of the Series A Shares that are not held in the CPO Trust that are voted at any shareholders meeting. Currently, the Rincón Family Trust owns a majority of the shares of Series A Shares that are not held in the CPO Trust. As of March 31, 2005, the latest date for which information is available, 3,930,078 Series A Shares were held in the CPO Trust. Issuance of Series B Shares On February 23, 2005, in connection with our financial restructuring, we issued 18,805,918 of our Series B Shares, representing 17.0% of our issued and outstanding capital stock following this issuance. The issuance of our Series B Shares had a substantial dilutive effect on the holders of our Series A Shares, including our principal shareholders. Related Party Transactions Administradora Corporativa y Mercantil, S.A. de C.V. From time to time, ACM, a company owned and controlled by the Rincón family, borrows funds from our company to fund principal and interest payments on its indebtedness. The outstanding balance on these loans was Ps 202.4 million at December 31, 2005. We recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in the full amount of these loans during 2003. These loans bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum and mature on December 31, 2012. Durango Paper Company On October 7, 2002, the Company sold its subsidiary, Durango Paper Company, and certain promissory notes to Operadora Omega Internacional, S.A. de C.V. The sale was made for an aggregate amount of US$100 thousand. Prior to this sale, the Company had guaranteed certain obligations of Durango Paper Companys subsidiaries, specifically the Bank of America, N.A. loan agreement and the J.P. Morgan letters of credit, which in the aggregate, 67 totaled a principal amount of US$25.2 million ($290.4 million). In 2003, these creditors called these guarantees. As a result, the Company recorded $285.0 million as due from related parties in 2003 and recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in the full amount of this obligation. Líneas Aéreas Ejecutivas de Durango, S.A. de C.V. On April 18, 2005, our company purchased substantially all of the capital stock of Líneas Aéreas for Ps 15.0 thousand from certain members of the Rincón family and some of their children. Líneas Aéreas owns two business jets and provides transportation services to our subsidiaries and third parties. In connection with this transaction, we assumed a financial lease agreement with GE Capital Leasing with respect to one of the business jets. Under this financial lease agreement, we are required to make monthly lease payments with a final payment due in October 2007. The outstanding amount under this financial lease bears interest at a rate of prime + 1.50% per annum. Our obligations under this financial lease are secured by a pledge of the business jet. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under this financial lease was US$4.9 million (Ps 52.3 million). On February 24, 2006, we prepaid US$4.6 million under this financial lease. We expect to prepay the remaining outstanding amounts under this financial lease in connection with our pending sale of the business jet. In 2003, Líneas Aéreas borrowed Ps 15.2 million from our company. This loan bears interest at a rate of 15% per annum and matures on December 31, 2006. As a result of our acquisition of Líneas Aéreas, the amount of this loan is eliminated in the consolidation of our financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2005 prior to our acquisition of Líneas Aéreas, we purchased services from Líneas Aéreas for an aggregate purchase price of Ps 1.1 million.
