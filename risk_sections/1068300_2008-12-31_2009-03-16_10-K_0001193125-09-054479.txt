Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in the Companys common stock (Common Stock) involves risks. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that the Company believes affect its business and an investment in its Common Stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company are unaware of, or that it currently deems immaterial, also may become important factors that affect the Company and its business. If any of the risks described in this annual report on Form 10-K were to occur, the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Common Stock could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Associated with the Company's Business The current economic environment poses significant challenges for the Company and could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain conditions nationally and locally in its markets. Financial institutions continue to be affected by declines in the real estate market that have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage, construction and commercial real estate loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. The Company retains direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets, and is affected by these events. Continued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job losses, could have an adverse affect on the Company's borrowers or its customers, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company's ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in its credit portfolio is made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions. The Company also expects to face increased regulation and government oversight as a result of these downward trends. This increased government action may increase the Companys costs and limit its ability to pursue certain business opportunities. In addition, the Company may be required to pay even higher FDIC deposit insurance premiums than the recently increased level, including if the special assessment of 20 basis points proposed by the FDIC becomes final, because financial institution failures resulting from the depressed market conditions and other factors have depleted and may continue to deplete the deposit insurance fund and reduce its ratio of reserves to insured deposits. A prolonged national economic recession or further deterioration in these conditions in the Company's markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences:  increases in loan delinquencies;  increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures;  decreases in demand for the Company's products and services, which could adversely affect its liquidity position; and  decreases in the value of the collateral securing the Company's loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers' borrowing power. The Company does not believe these difficult conditions are likely to improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult economic conditions on the Company, its customers and the other financial institutions in its market. As a result, the Company may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds. The U.S. Treasury and the FDIC have initiated programs to address economic stabilization, yet the efficacy of these programs in stabilizing the economy and the banking system at large are uncertain. 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements There can be no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and other recently enacted government programs will help stabilize the U.S. financial system. On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the EESA. The legislation was the result of a proposal by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to the U.S. Congress on September 20, 2008 in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions. The U.S. Treasury and federal banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation and otherwise to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system, including the CPP, in which the Company participated. In addition, other regulators have taken steps to attempt to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets, such as the FDICs TLGP. On February 10, 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced the Financial Stability Plan, which earmarks the second $350 billion originally authorized under the EESA. The Financial Stability Plan is intended to, among other things, make capital available to financial institutions, purchase certain legacy loans and assets from financial institutions, restart securitization markets for loans to consumers and businesses and relieve certain pressures on the housing market, including the reduction of mortgage payments and interest rates. In addition, the ARRA, which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, includes, among other things, extensive new restrictions on the compensation arrangements of financial institutions participating in TARP. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that the EESA, as supplemented by the Financial Stability Plan, the ARRA and other programs, will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced. The failure of the EESA, the ARRA, the Financial Stability Plan and other programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect the Companys businesses, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of the Companys Common Stock. The EESA, ARRA and the Financial Stability Plan are relatively new initiatives and, as such, are subject to change and evolving interpretation. There can be no assurances as to the effects that any further changes will have on the effectiveness of the governments efforts to stabilize the credit markets or on the Companys businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented and could adversely impact the Company's results of operation and access to capital. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year. In recent months, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength. If the current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience further adverse effects, which may be material, on its ability to access capital and on its results of operations. The Company's business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect its earnings and capital levels. The majority of the Companys assets are monetary in nature and, as a result, the Company is subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates can impact the Companys net interest income as well as the valuation of its assets and liabilities. The Companys earnings are significantly dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company expects that it will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities, meaning that either its interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements rates than its interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to the Companys position, this gap will negatively impact the Companys earnings. An increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and the Companys ability to originate loans. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to an increase in prepayments on the Companys loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates affect the Companys net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, market value of loans and mortgage-backed securities portfolios. Market interest rates are affected by many factors outside of the Companys control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply and international disorder, and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. In view of the low interest rates on savings, loans and investments that currently prevail, it is quite possible that significant changes in interest rates may take place in the future, and the Company cannot always accurately predict the nature or magnitude of such changes or how such changes may affect its business. Although the Companys asset-liability management strategy is designed to control its risk from changes in the general level of market interest rates, it may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse affect on the Companys earnings and capital levels. A large percentage of the Company's loans are collateralized by real estate, and an adverse change in the real estate market may result in losses and adversely affect its profitability. Approximately 88.6% of the Companys loan portfolio as of December 31, 2008 was comprised of loans collateralized by real estate. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in the Companys primary market areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing the loans and the value of real estate owned by the Company. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, amounts received upon disposal of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest on the loan. As a result, the Companys profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $144.4 million or 10.7% of the Companys gross loan portfolio was in real estate construction loans. Of this amount, $43.2 million were made to finance residential construction projects, of which 84.5% were located in Texas, and 15.5% were located in California. Further, $101.1 million of real estate construction loans were made to finance commercial construction, with 74.7% of these loans made to finance construction projects located in Texas and 25.3% of those loans made to finance construction projects located in California. Construction loans are subject to risks during the construction phase that are not present in standard residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. These risks include:  the viability of the contractor;  the contractors ability to complete the project, to meet deadlines and time schedules and to stay within cost estimates; and  concentrations of such loans with a single contractor and its affiliates. Real estate construction loans also present risks of default in the event of declines in property values or volatility in the real estate market during the construction phase. The current slowdown in the sales of residential properties, and the related reduction in prices, has affected construction lending activities in the Companys market area, and the Company expects that these conditions will have the effect of extending the durations of its construction loans and increasing the risk of possible loss on these loans. If any of these risks were to occur, it could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In December 2006, banking regulators issued guidance regarding high concentrations of commercial and real estate construction loans within bank loan portfolios. The guidance requires institutions that exceed certain levels of real estate lending to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations if they do not have appropriate risk management policies and practices in place. If there is any deterioration in the Companys commercial real estate portfolio or its regulators conclude that it has not implemented appropriate risk management policies and practices, it could adversely affect the Companys business and result in a requirement of increased capital levels, and such capital may not be available at that time. The Company could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on its foreclosed real estate assets. A significant portion of the Companys loan portfolio is secured by real property. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic waste could be discovered on the properties that secure the Companys loans. If the Company acquires such properties as a result of foreclosure, it could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up or removing this waste, and this cost could exceed the value of the underlying properties and adversely affect the Companys profitability. Although the Company has policies and procedures that require it to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The Company's allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, which could adversely affect its earnings. As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that its loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate the Company for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the Companys loan portfolio, including the diversification by industry of its commercial loan portfolio, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of its loan portfolio, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers and the evaluation of its loan portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the Company has experienced to date. In determining the size of the allowance, the Company relies on an analysis of its loan portfolio, its experience and its evaluation of general economic conditions. If the Companys assumptions prove to be incorrect or if it experiences significant loan losses, its current allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio. A material addition to the allowance could cause a material decrease in net income. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of the Companys management. Any increase in the Companys allowance for loan losses or charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material negative effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition. Liquidity risk could impair the Company's ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition. Liquidity is essential to the Companys business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity. The Companys access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms which are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company's access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements regulatory action against it. The Companys ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets. If the goodwill that the Company recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on the Company's profitability. Goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired in the purchase of another financial institution. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired. Examples of those events or circumstances include the following:  significant adverse change in business climate;  significant changes in credit quality;  significant unanticipated loss of customers;  unanticipated loss of key personnel;  significant loss of deposits or loans; or  significant reductions in profitability. The Company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in the Companys results of operations in the periods in which they become known. At December 31, 2008, the Companys goodwill totaled $21.8 million. While the Company has recorded no such impairment charges since it initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that its future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs. The Companys ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and its financial performance. The ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Companys cost of funding and limit its access to some of its customary sources of capital, including, but not limited to, inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. The Company cannot assure you that such capital will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit its access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of investors, depositors of the Banks or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may adversely affect the Companys capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys businesses, financial condition and results of operations. The Company's profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions. The Companys success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets in which it operates. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the greater Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas in Texas, and 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in the greater San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco metropolitan areas in California. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the Companys commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. In addition, if the population or income growth in the Companys market areas is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in a reduction of the Companys expansion, growth and profitability. Recently, economic conditions in California and, to a lesser extent, Texas have declined and if either of these regions experiences a downturn or a recession for a prolonged period of time, the Company would likely experience significant increases in nonperforming loans, which could lead to operating losses, impaired liquidity and eroding capital. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and negatively affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. The small to medium-sized businesses that the Company lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which may impair a borrowers ability to repay a loan to the Company, and such impairment could materially harm our operating results. The Company targets its business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower's ability to repay a loan. The Company makes both secured and some unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers businesses. Secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. In addition, the success of a small to medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact the Companys market areas could cause the Company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. The limitations on incentive compensation contained in the ARRA may adversely affect the Company's ability to retain its highest performing employees. As a participant in the U.S. Treasurys CPP, the Company is subject to the executive compensation limitations under the EESA and the ARRA. The recently enacted ARRA contains restrictions on bonus and other incentive compensation payable to the five (5) executives named in a companys proxy statement and in certain circumstances these restrictions apply to the next five (5) to twenty (20) highest paid employees, as the case may be. Depending upon the limitations placed on incentive compensation by the final regulations issued under the ARRA, it is possible that the Company may be unable to create a compensation structure that permits the Company to retain its highest performing employees. If this were to occur, the Companys business and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Potential acquisitions may disrupt the Company's business and dilute shareholder value. The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:  Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;  Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;  Difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, management, products and services of the target company;  Potential disruption to the Companys business;  Potential diversion of the Company management's time and attention;  Possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; and  Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. From time to time, the Company evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Companys tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. The Companys failure to successfully integrate any entity it may acquire and realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from such acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and business. An interruption in or breach in security of the Company's information systems may result in a loss of customer business. The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposits, servicing or loan origination systems. Although the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or minimize the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach of its communications or information systems, the Company cannot assure that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by the Company. The occurrence of any such failures, interruptions or security breaches could result in a loss of customer business and have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The business of the Company is dependent on technology and its inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company's future success will depend in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of the Companys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company operates in a highly regulated environment and, as a result, is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that could adversely affect its financial performance, and the Company may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations. The Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on the Company, its subsidiary banks, and their respective operations. In response to the downturn in the economy, recent market volatility and lack of liquidity in the credit markets, new legislation has been introduced and passed and it is likely that there will be significant changes to the banking regulatory regime in the future. Such additional legislation and regulations could significantly affect the Companys powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of MetroBank or Metro United, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on the Company. Risks Associated with the Company's Common Stock The Company's corporate organizational documents and the provisions of Texas law to which it is subject may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that you may favor. The Company's amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain various provisions which may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of The Company. These provisions include:  a board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered three year terms;  a provision that any special meeting of the Companys shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the president and chief executive officer, the majority of the board of directors or the holders of at least 50% of the Companys shares entitled to vote at the meeting;  a provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at an annual or special meeting of shareholders; and  a provision that denies shareholders the right to amend the Companys bylaws. The Company's articles of incorporation provide for noncumulative voting for directors and authorize the board of directors to issue shares of its preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The issuance of the Company preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a controlling interest in the Company. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of the Company. The trading volume in the Company Common Stock has been low. Although the Company common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the trading volume in the Company common stock has been limited and is less than that of larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market place of willing buyers and sellers of the Company common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the limited trading volume of the Company Common Stock, significant sales of its Common Stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the Company's stock price to fall. As of December 31, 2008, the Company's executive officers and directors owned approximately 25.1% of the Common Stock. The significant amount of Common Stock owned by the Companys executive officers and directors may adversely affect the development of a more active trading market. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Future dividend payments and common stock repurchases are restricted by the terms of the U.S. Treasury's equity investment in the Company. Under the terms of the CPP, for so long as any preferred stock issued under the CPP remains outstanding, the Company is prohibited from increasing dividends on its Common Stock, and from making certain repurchases of equity securities, including its Common Stock, without the U.S. Treasury's consent until the third anniversary of the U.S. Treasury's investment or until the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock it purchased under the CPP to third parties. Further, as long as the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is outstanding, dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities, including Company Common Stock, are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. For additional details about the Company's participation in the CPP, please refer to the section captioned Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRecent Developments in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The holders of the Company's junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of the Company's shareholders. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $40.1 million in junior subordinated debentures outstanding of which $36.1 million were issued to the Company's subsidiary trust, MCBI Statutory Trust I. The Trust purchased the junior subordinated debentures from the Company using the proceeds from the sale of trust preferred securities to third party investors and common securities to the Company. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by the Company to the extent not paid or made by the Trust, provided the Trust has funds available for such obligations. The junior subordinated debentures are senior to the Companys shares of Common Stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on its Common Stock and, in the event of the Company's bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the Common Stock. The Company has the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of the Company's Common Stock. The Company's ability to pay the future distributions depends upon the earnings of the Banks and dividends from the Banks to the Company, which may be inadequate to service the obligations. Item 1B.
