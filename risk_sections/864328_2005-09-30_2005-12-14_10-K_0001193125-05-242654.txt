Risk Factors This document, and the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other materials released to the public contain forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may discuss the Companys prospects, expected revenue, expenses and profits, strategies for its operations and other subjects, including conditions in the oilfield service and oil and natural gas industries and in the United States and international economy in general. Our forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that may not prove to be accurate. All of the Companys forward-looking information is, therefore, subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected. Although it is not possible to identify all factors, these risks and uncertainties include the risk factors discussed below. Business Risks. The Companys results of operations could be adversely affected if its business assumptions do not prove to be accurate or if adverse changes occur in the Companys business environment, including the following areas:  potential declines or increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices that would adversely affect our customers and the energy industry,  declines in drilling activity,  reduction in prices or demand for our products and services,  general global economic and business conditions, 13 Table of Contents  the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels for oil,  the Companys ability to successfully integrate acquisitions,  our ability to generate technological advances and compete on the basis of advanced technology,  delays in oil and natural gas activity permitting,  the potential for unexpected litigation or proceedings,  competition and consolidation in our businesses and  potentially higher prices for products used by the Company in its operations. Risks of Economic Downturn. In the event of an economic downturn in the United States or globally, there may be decreased demand and lower prices for oil and natural gas and therefore for our products and services. The Companys customers are generally involved in the energy industry, and if these customers experience a business decline, we may be subject to increased exposure to credit risk. If an economic downturn occurs, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Risks from Operating Hazards. The Companys operations are subject to hazards present in the oil and natural gas industry, such as fire, explosion, blowouts and oil spills. These incidents as well as accidents or problems in normal operations can cause personal injury or death and damage to property or the environment. The customers operations can also be interrupted. From time to time, customers seek to recover from the Company for damage to their equipment or property that occurred while the Company was performing work. Damage to the customers property could be extensive if a major problem occurred. For example, operating hazards could arise:  in the pressure pumping, completion fluids, completion tools and casing and tubular services, during work performed on oil and natural gas wells,  in the production chemical business, as a result of use of the Companys products in oil and natural gas wells and refineries, and  in the process and pipeline business, as a result of work performed by the Company at petrochemical plants as well as on pipelines. Risks from Unexpected Litigation. The Company has insurance coverage against operating hazards, which it believes is customary in the industry. This insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The Companys insurance premiums can be increased or decreased based on the claims made by the Company under its insurance policies. The insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by the Company or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices. Whenever possible, the Company obtains agreements from customers that limit the Companys liability. Insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks, and the Companys results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance. Risks from Ongoing Investigations. In recent government actions, civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions have been imposed against several public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments and deficiencies in books and records and internal controls. The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions they may seek to impose in these circumstances, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. We are in discussions with the Department of Justice and the SEC regarding our internal investigations and cannot currently predict the outcome of our investigations, when any of these matters will be resolved, or what, if any, actions may be taken by the Department of Justice, the SEC or other authorities or the effect the actions may have on our consolidated financial statements. 14 Table of Contents Risks from International Operations. The Companys international operations are subject to special risks that can materially affect the Companys sales and profits. These risks include:  limits on access to international markets,  unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest, and hostilities in some petroleum-producing and consuming countries and regions where we operate or seek to operate,  declines in, or suspension of, activity by our customers in our areas of operations due to adverse local or regional economic, political and other conditions that affect drilling operations,  fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates,  the impact of inflation,  governmental action such as expropriation of assets, and changes in general legislative and regulatory environments, exchange controls, global trade policies such as trade restrictions and embargoes imposed and international business, political and economic conditions and  the risk that events or actions taken by the Company or others as a result of its currently ongoing investigations (see Managements Discussion and AnalysisInvestigations Regarding Misappropriation and Possible Illegal Payments.) adversely affect the Companys operations in the affected countries. Weather. The Companys performance is significantly impacted by the demand for natural gas in North America. Warmer than normal winters in North America, among other factors, may adversely impact demand for natural gas and, therefore, demand for the Companys services. Conversely, colder than normal winters may positively impact demand for natural gas and the Companys services. In addition, our U.S. operations could be materially affected by severe weather in the Gulf of Mexico. Severe weather, such as hurricanes, may cause:  evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services,  damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of operations, and  loss of or damage to our equipment, inventory, and facilities. Credit. If the Companys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade, this could increase our costs of obtaining, or make it more difficult to obtain or issue, new debt financing. If our credit rating is downgraded, we could be required to, among other things, pay additional interest under our credit agreements, or provide additional guarantees, collateral, letters of credit or cash for credit support obligations. Other Risks. Other risk factors that could cause actual results to be different from the results we expect include changes in environmental laws and other governmental regulations. Many of these risks are beyond the control of the Company. In addition, future trends for pricing, margins, revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict in the industries we serve and under current economic and political conditions. Except as required by applicable law, we do not assume any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements.
