Item 1A. Risk Factors This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report. Recent disruptions in the global economy, the financial markets, currency markets and energy markets, as well as government responses to these disruptions, may adversely impact our business and results of operations. Recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on the availability of credit and liquidity resources. Some of our customers may face issues gaining access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. Lack of availability of consumer credit and the general economic downturn could adversely impact the market in which we operate. As a result of recent fluctuations in currency markets and the strong dollar relative to many other major currencies, our products priced in United States dollars may be more expensive relative to products of our foreign competitors, which could result in lower sales. In addition, the non-dollar denominated earnings of our foreign operations may be lower when reported by us in dollars. A slowdown in economic activity caused by a recession would likely reduce worldwide demand for our products. Our new Aspire System with SlimLipo handpiece requires the use of consumable treatment tips and fiber delivery assemblies. In the future, we may derive substantial revenue from sales of those consumable components. These products were recently introduced and could fail to generate significant revenue or achieve market acceptance. 12 In April 2008, we launched the Aspire body sculpting system and SlimLipo handpiece. Shipments began in the third quarter of 2008. The SlimLipo handpiece is our first minimally invasive product and provides laser-assisted lipolysis during liposuction procedures. The SlimLipo handpiece requires the use of consumable, single-use treatment tips and a limited-use fiber delivery assembly. In the future, we could receive substantial revenue from sales of the Aspire system with SlimLipo handpiece as well as the consumable components. Our future success will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to increase and maintain sales of the Aspire system with SlimLipo handpiece as well as the consumable components. Several competing systems also require the use of consumable components, while others do not or their consumable components allow for more usage before needing to be replaced. Competing against such systems may be more difficult. If third parties are able to supply our customers with consumable treatment tips and fiber delivery assemblies for the Aspire system with SlimLipo handpiece, our business could be adversely impacted. Our consumable treatment tips and fiber delivery assemblies are protected by an encryption technology that is designed to authenticate that the tips are supplied by us or by a supplier authorized by us. It is possible that a third party may be able to find methods of circumventing our encryption technology and other technological barriers that we have employed to ensure that only our tips are used with the Aspire system with SlimLipo handpiece. If a third party is able to supply consumable treatment tips and fibers to our customers, this could result in a reduction in the rate of sales and price of consumable treatment tips and fiber delivery assemblies. It could also lead to a reduction in the safety or efficacy of treatments performed with the Aspire system and SlimLipo handpiece as we cannot control the quality of such third party products. This could damage the Aspire brand and result in loss of confidence in our products. We have limited experience manufacturing the Aspire system, SlimLipo handpiece and consumable treatment tips and fiber laser assemblies in commercial quantities, which could adversely impact our business. We began manufacturing our Aspire system, SlimLipo handpiece and consumable treatment tips and fiber delivery assemblies in during the second half of 2008. Because we have only limited experience in manufacturing in commercial quantities, we may encounter unforeseen situations that would result in delays or shortfalls. We face significant challenges and risk in manufacturing the Aspire laser system, SlimLipo handpiece and consumable treatment tips and fibers, including that production processes may have to change to accommodate any significant future expansion of our manufacturing operations and growth; key components are currently provided by a single supplier or limited number of suppliers, and we do not maintain large inventory levels of these components; and we have limited experience manufacturing the Aspire system, SlimLipo handpiece and consumable treatment tips and fiber delivery assemblies in compliance with FDAs Quality System Regulation. If we are unable to keep up with or generate demand for the Aspire system, SlimLipo handpiece and consumable components, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for the Aspire system, SlimLipo handpiece and consumable components could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase competitors products. If we do not continue to develop and commercialize new products and identify new markets for our products and technology, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer. The aesthetic light-based (both lasers and lamps) treatment system industry is subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If we do not continue to be innovative in the development of new products and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products and applications. We compete in the development, manufacture, marketing, sales and servicing of light-based devices with numerous other companies, some of which have substantially greater direct worldwide sales capabilities. Our products also face competition from medical treatments and products, prescription drugs and cosmetic topicals and procedures, such as electrolysis and waxing. Our products are subject to numerous medical device regulations. Compliance is expensive and time-consuming. Without necessary clearances, we may be unable to sell products and compete effectively. All of our current products are light-based devices, which are subject to FDA regulations for clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, sale, distribution and promotion. Before a new product or a new use of or claim for an existing product can be marketed in the United States, we must obtain clearance from the FDA. In the event that we do not obtain FDA clearances, our ability to market products in the United States and revenue derived therefrom may be adversely affected. The types of medical devices that we seek to market in the U.S. generally must receive either 510(k) clearance or PMA approval in advance from the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDAs 510(k) clearance process can be expensive and usually takes from three to twelve months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer from the time the pre-market approval application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. 13 In order to obtain pre-market approval and, in some cases, a 510(k) clearance, a product sponsor must conduct well controlled clinical trials designed to test the safety and effectiveness of the product. Conducting clinical trials generally entails a long, expensive and uncertain process that is subject to delays and failure at any stage. The data obtained from clinical trials may be inadequate to support approval or clearance of a submission. In addition, the occurrence of unexpected findings in connection with clinical trials may prevent or delay obtaining approval or clearance. If we conduct clinical trials, they may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval or clearance, for numerous reasons, including: o FDA, other regulatory authorities or an institutional review board may place a clinical trial on hold; o patients may not enroll in clinical trials, or patient follow-up may not occur, at the rate we expect; o patients may not comply with trial protocols; o institutional review boards and third party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol; o third party clinical investigators may decline to participate in a trial or may not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices, or other FDA requirements; o third party organizations may not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; o regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials, or invalidate our clinical trials; o governmental regulations may change or administrative actions may occur that cause delays; and o the interim or final results of the clinical trials may be inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness. Medical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. The FDA may not approve or clear indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products. Our clearances can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop. To date, the FDA has deemed our products eligible for the 510(k) clearance process. We believe that our products in development will receive similar treatment. However, we cannot be sure that the FDA will not impose the more burdensome PMA approval process upon one or more of our future products, nor can we be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. We often seek FDA clearance for additional indications for use. Clinical trials in support of such clearances for additional indications may be costly and time-consuming. In the event that we do not obtain additional FDA clearances, our ability to market products in the United States and revenue derived therefrom may be adversely affected. Medical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared, and if we are found to be marketing our products for off-label, or non-approved, uses we might be subject to FDA enforcement action or have other resulting liability. Our products are subject to similar regulations in many international markets. Complying with these regulations is necessary for our strategy of expanding the markets for sales of our products into these countries. Compliance with the regulatory clearance process in any country is expensive and time consuming. Regulatory clearances may necessitate clinical testing, limitations on the number of sales and limitations on the type of end user, among other things. In certain instances, these constraints can delay planned shipment schedules as design and engineering modifications are made in response to regulatory concerns and requests. We may not be able to obtain clearances in each country in a timely fashion or at all, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries. 14 After clearance or approval of our products, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, and if we fail to comply with FDA regulations, our business could suffer. Even after clearance or approval of a product, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including the requirements that our facility be registered and our devices listed with the agency. We are subject to Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We must report corrections and removals to the FDA where the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health, and we must maintain records of other corrections or removals. The FDA closely regulates promotion and advertising and our promotional and advertising activities could come under scrutiny. If the FDA objects to our promotional and advertising activities or finds that we failed to submit reports under the Medical Device Reporting regulations, for example, the FDA may allege our activities resulted in violations. The FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions: o letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; o repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; o operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; o refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products or new intended uses; and o criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, they could harm our business. We have modified some of our products and sold them under prior 510(k) clearances. The FDA could retroactively decide the modifications required new 510(k) clearances and require us to cease marketing and/or recall the modified products. Any modification to one of our 510(k) cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance. We may be required to submit pre-clinical and clinical data depending on the nature of the changes. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products into the market in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenue and operating results. We have modified some of our marketed devices, but we believe that new 510(k) clearances are not required. We cannot be certain that the FDA would agree with any of our decisions not to seek 510(k) clearance. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance for any modification, we also may be required to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until we obtain a new 510(k) clearance. Federal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a device. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 15 We may also be subject to state regulations. State regulations, and changes to state regulations, may prevent sales to particular end users or may restrict use of the products to particular end users or under particular supervision which may decrease revenues or prevent growth of revenues. Our products may also be subject to state regulations. Federal regulation allows our products to be sold to and used by licensed practitioners as determined on a state-by-state basis which complicates monitoring compliance. As a result, in some states non-physicians may purchase and operate our products. In most states, it is within a physicians discretion to determine whom they can supervise in the operation of our products and the level of supervision. However, some states have specific regulations as to appropriate supervision and who may be supervised. A state could disagree with our decision to sell to a particular type of end user or change regulations to prevent sales to particular types of end users or change regulations as to supervision requirements. In several states, applicable regulations are in flux. Thus, state regulations and changes to state regulations may decrease revenues or prevent growth of revenues. Outside of the United States, we rely on third party distributors to market and sell a large portion of our products. In January 2008, we entered into an international distribution agreement with Q-MED AB and began the process of evaluating a transition to Q-MED as our exclusive distributor outside of North America. However, due to the downturn in the world-wide economic environment, Palomar and Q-MED mutually terminated their international distribution agreement on January 8, 2009. During this period, some of our existing distributors were disrupted. We are in the process of working with existing distributors and seeking new distributors to improve our international sales and marketing efforts. If this process is not successful our business and operating results may be harmed. In the United States, we sell our products through our internal sales organization. Outside of this market, we sell our products through third party distributors. Our sales and marketing success in these other markets depends on these distributors, in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace. On January 9, 2008, we announced our international distribution agreement with the Swedish company Q-MED AB, the producer of Restylane. We began working with Q-MED and current distributors to determine how each distributor might successfully work with Q-MED during and after the time each country is transitioned. The relationship with some of our distributors was disrupted. Due to the downturn in the world-wide economic environment, Q-MED concentrated on their own product line of dermal fillers. Both Palomar and Q-MED agreed that we would be better served by separately continuing to expand our existing distribution channel. Palomar and Q-MED mutually terminated the international distribution agreement on January 8, 2009. We are currently in the process of working with current distributors and seeking new distributors to improve our international sales and marketing efforts. If the current and new distributors do not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products and collect receivables due for past sales, our revenue from international sales may be adversely affected and our operating results could suffer. Because we do not require training for all users of our products, and sell our products to non-physicians, there exists an increased potential for misuse of our products, which could harm our reputation and our business. Federal regulations allow us to sell our products to or on the order of practitioners licensed by state law. The definition of licensed practitioners varies from state to state. As a result, our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training and, in many states, by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners, chiropractors and technicians. Outside the United States, many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products. We do not supervise the procedures performed with our products, nor do we require that direct medical supervision occur. Our products come with an operators manual. We and our distributors offer product training sessions, but neither we nor our distributors require purchasers or operators of our products to attend training sessions. The lack of required training and the purchase and use of our products by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation. 16 Achieving complete compliance with FDA regulations is difficult, and if we fail to comply, we could be subject to FDA enforcement action or our business could suffer. We are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. The FDAs regulatory scheme is complex, especially the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. Because some of our products involve the use of lasers, those products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products. The FDA enforces the Quality System Regulation and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections. The complexity of the Quality System Regulation makes complete compliance difficult to achieve. Also, the determination as to whether a Quality System Regulation violation has occurred is often subjective. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply with the Quality System Regulation or other applicable requirements or failed to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse Quality System Regulation inspection or comply with applicable laser performance standards, the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, including a public warning letter or other stronger remedies, such as fines, injunctions, criminal and civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of our production, refusing to permit the import or export of our products, delaying or refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products, withdrawing product approvals already granted or criminal prosecution, any of which could cause our business and operating results to suffer. We purchased land and began construction of a new operational facility during the fourth quarter of 2008. We are in the process of coordinating the transition from the current facility to the new facility. During this process, our operations may be disrupted during the move to our new facility and our business and operating results could be harmed. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we closed on the purchase of land for $10.7 million and entered into a construction management agreement for construction of a new operational facility on that land at a guaranteed maximum price of $22.5 million. We began construction in the fourth quarter. The lease for this facility was to expire in August 2009. However, we have negotiated a 12 month lease extension, expiring in August 2010, at an increase over our current rate to coordinate the timing between the construction of our new facility and the expiration of our current facility lease. During this time, we may incur many issues which would negatively affect our business and operating results, including: o higher rental expenses after the lease on our current operational facility expires; o permitting difficulties for our new operational facility; o construction cost overruns; and o disruption of operations during the move from our current facility to our new operational facility. Our effective income tax rate may vary significantly. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years items, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, future levels of research and development spending, stock option grants, deductions for employee stock option exercises being different than what we projected, and changes in overall levels of income before taxes. Failure to manage our relationships with third party researchers effectively may limit our access to new technology, increase the cost of licensing new technology, and divert management attention from our core business. We are dependent upon third-party researchers over whom we do not have absolute control to satisfactorily conduct and complete research on our behalf. We are also dependent upon third-party researchers to grant us licensing terms, which may or may not be favorable, for products and technology they may develop. We provide research funding, light technology and optics know-how in return for licensing rights with respect to specific dermatologic and cosmetic applications and patents. In return for certain exclusive license rights, we are subject to due diligence obligations in order to maintain such exclusivity. Our success will be dependent upon the results of research with our partners and meeting due diligence obligations. We cannot be sure that third-party researchers will agree with our interpretation of the terms of our agreements, that we will meet our due diligence obligations, or that such research agreements will provide us with marketable products in the future or that any of the products developed under these agreements will be profitable for us. 17 If our new products do not gain market acceptance, our revenues and operating results could suffer. The commercial success of the products and technology we develop will depend upon the acceptance of these products by providers of aesthetic procedures and their patients and clients. It is difficult for us to predict how successful recently introduced products, or products we are currently developing, will be over the long term. If the products we develop do not gain market acceptance, our revenues and operating results could suffer. We expect that many of the products we develop will be based upon new technologies or new applications of existing technologies. It may be difficult for us to achieve market acceptance of some of our products, particularly the first products that we introduce to the market based on new technologies or new applications of existing technologies. If demand for our aesthetic treatment systems by non-traditional physician customers and spas does not develop as we expect, our revenues will suffer and our business will be harmed. Our revenues from non-traditional physician customers and spa purchasers of our products continue to increase. We believe, and our growth expectations assume, that we and other companies selling light-based (lasers and lamps) aesthetic treatment systems have only begun to penetrate these markets and that our revenues from selling to these markets will continue to increase. If our expectations as to the size of these markets and our ability to sell our products to participants in these markets are not correct, our revenues will suffer and our business will be harmed. If there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products could decline, which would adversely affect our operating results. Most procedures performed using our aesthetic treatment systems are elective procedures that are not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The cost of these elective procedures must be borne by the client. As a result, the decision to undergo a procedure that utilizes our products may be influenced by a number of factors, including: o consumer awareness of and demand for procedures and treatments; o the cost, safety and effectiveness of the procedure and of alternative treatments; o the success of our and our customers sales and marketing efforts to purchasers of these procedures; and o consumer confidence, which may be affected by short-term or long-term economic and other conditions. If there is not sufficient demand for the procedures performed with our products, a weakening in the economy, or other factors, practitioner demand for our products may be reduced or buying decisions postponed, which would adversely affect our operating results. Our business and operations are experiencing rapid change. If we fail to effectively manage the changing market, our business and operating results could be harmed. 18 We have experienced rapid change in the scope of our operations and the industry in which we operate. This change has placed significant demands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources. If we do not effectively manage the changing market and its effect on our business, the efficiency of our operations and the quality of our products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. To effectively manage this change, we will need to continue to: o implement appropriate operational, financial and management controls, systems and procedures; o change our manufacturing capacity and scale of production; o change our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and capabilities; and o provide adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards. Failure to receive shipments of critical components could reduce revenues and reduced reliability of critical components could increase expenses. We develop light-based systems that incorporate third-party components and we purchase some of these components from small, specialized vendors that are not well capitalized. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these third parties for the supply of parts. A disruption in the delivery of these key components, or our inability to obtain substitute components or subassemblies from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, or our inability to obtain assembly or testing services could prevent us from manufacturing products and result in a decrease in revenue. We depend on an acceptable level of reliability for purchased components. Reliability below expectations for key components could have an adverse affect on inventory and inventory reserves. Any extended interruption in our supplies of third-party components could materially harm our business. We forecast sales to determine requirements for components and materials used in our products and if our forecasts are incorrect, we may experience either delays in shipments or increased inventory costs. To manage our manufacturing operations with our suppliers, we forecast anticipated product orders and material requirements to predict our inventory needs and enter into purchase orders on the basis of these requirements. Our limited historical experience may not provide us with enough data to accurately predict future demand. If our business expands, our demand for components and materials would increase and our suppliers may be unable to meet our demand. If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we will have excess inventories, which would increase our expenses. If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventories, which could interrupt, delay, or prevent delivery of our products to our customers. Our proprietary technology has only limited protections which may not prevent competitors from copying our new developments. This may impair our ability to compete effectively. We may expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights to prevent such copying, and our intellectual property could be determined to be not infringed, invalid or unenforceable. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, licenses and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We own and license a variety of patents and patent applications in the United States and corresponding patents and patent applications in many foreign jurisdictions. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. We have granted certain patent licenses to several competitors, and in return for those license grants, we receive a significant ongoing royalty revenue stream. A few of these competitors entered into license agreements only after we sued them for patent infringement. We are currently enforcing these patents against Candela Corporation and Syneron, Inc. and intend to enforce against other competitors in the future. We do not know how successful we will be in asserting our patents against Candela or other suspected infringers. Whether or not we are successful in the pending lawsuit, litigation consumes substantial amounts of our financial resources and diverts managements attention away from our core business. Public announcements concerning this litigation that are unfavorable to us may in the future result in significant declines in our stock price. An adverse ruling or judgment in this matter could result in a loss of our significant ongoing royalty revenue stream and could also have a material adverse effect on license agreements with other companies both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation and cause our stock price to decline significantly. (For more information about our patent litigation, see Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings.) 19 In addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how. We generally enter into agreements with our employees and third parties with whom we work, including but not limited to consultants and vendors, to restrict access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information and define our intellectual property ownership rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology, proprietary information and know-how and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed and the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected. Costly and time consuming lawsuits may be necessary to enforce and defend patents issued or licensed exclusively to us, to protect our trade secrets and/or know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of others intellectual property rights. Such lawsuits may result in patents issued or licensed exclusively to us to be found invalid and unenforceable. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology and which do not infringe our patents. Claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to pay royalties or incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non-infringing technology. In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. The light-based cosmetic and dermatology industry in particular is characterized by a large number of patents and related litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Because our resources are limited and patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time, we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications. Any claims for patent infringement, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause shipment delays, require us to develop non-infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the light-based industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties, which could have a negative impact on gross margins. There can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Candela Corporation has one pending patent infringement lawsuit against us. (For more information about our patent litigation, see Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings.) Litigation with Candela is expected to be expensive and protracted, and our intellectual property position may be weakened as a result of an adverse ruling or judgment. Whether or not we are successful in the pending lawsuit, litigation consumes substantial amounts of our financial resources and diverts managements attention away from our core business. Public announcements concerning this litigation that are unfavorable to us may in the future result in significant declines in our stock price. An adverse ruling or judgment in this matter could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We may not be able to successfully collect licensing royalties. Material portions of our revenues consist of royalties from sub-licensing patents licensed to us on an exclusive basis by Massachusetts General Hospital. If we are unable to collect our licensing royalties, our revenues will decline. 20 Quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall. Our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may swing sharply from quarter to quarter. If our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially. Our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for many reasons, some of which are outside of our control. For example, many factors are related to market supply and demand, including potential increases in the level and intensity of price competition between our competitors and us, potential decrease in demand for our products and possible delays in market acceptance of our new products. Other factors are related to our customers and include changes in or extensions of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles and changes in the timing of product sales in anticipation of new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors. Factors related to our operations may also cause quarterly revenue or operating results to fall below expectations, including our effectiveness in our manufacturing process, unsatisfactory performance of our distribution channels, service providers, or customer support organizations, and timing of any acquisitions and related costs. Managing our relationships with Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. and future development partners may divert the attention of key technical personnel and management from the core business. If, pursuant to rights in their respective agreements with us, any of these parties should end their relationship with us, our stock price could fall, and we may be unable to bring home-use devices to the market. We believe that our relationship with Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. and our past relationship with The Gillette Company (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Procter & Gamble Company) represent unique opportunities to bring light-based devices to the mass market. Significant resources and the attention of key technical personnel and management have been and may continue to be directed to the development and commercialization of such devices even though such devices will not likely be commercialized for several years, if ever. In addition, we cannot be sure that these parties will agree with our interpretation of the terms of the agreements, that the agreements will provide us with marketable products in the future or that we will receive payments for any of the products developed under the agreements. During the term of the agreements, both Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble have the ability to choose not to continue and may terminate the agreements. If Johnson & Johnson or Procter & Gamble should terminate their agreement with us, we will not receive certain payments, and the price of our common stock could fall significantly. If Johnson & Johnson should terminate their agreement with us, we may proceed to develop and commercialize the devices on our own or with a third party. We are currently developing devices on our own which may compete with products sold by Procter & Gamble. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such a strategy. In addition, after commercialization of such devices, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble are to pay us a percentage of net sales of such devices. Certain of these percentages of net sales are only owed if the devices are covered by valid patents. There can be no assurance that valid patents will cover the devices in any or all countries, in which the devices will be manufactured, used or sold. In addition, a certain portion of the proceeds received on such sales may be owed to Massachusetts General Hospital. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The expense and potential unavailability of liability insurance coverage for our customers could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and our financial condition. Some of our customers and prospective customers have had difficulty in procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operation and use of our products. Medical malpractice carriers are withdrawing coverage in some states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens, our customers may discontinue using our products, and potential customers may elect not to purchase laser and other light-based products. The reduced availability of consumer financing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Prior to selling to a new customer, we require proof of financing. Availability of financing is dependent on the lending practices of financial institutions, financial markets, governmental policies, and economic conditions, all of which are largely beyond our control. The reduced availability of financing from third party lenders for our customers could affect our sales volume and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 21 We may be unable to attract and retain key executives and research and development personnel that we need to succeed. As a small company with approximately 200 employees, our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and research and development positions. The loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to do so. Product liability suits could be brought against us due to a defective design, material or workmanship or due to misuse of our products. These lawsuits could be expensive and time consuming and result in substantial damages to us and increases in our insurance rates. If our products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients or clients. Furthermore, in the event that any of our products prove to be defectively designed and manufactured, we may be required to recall and redesign such products. Misusing our products or failing to adhere to operating guidelines for our products can cause severe burns or other damage to the eyes, skin or other tissue. We are routinely involved in claims related to the use of our products. Product liability claims could divert managements attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. Our current insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover these claims. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance in amount or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. We would need to pay any product losses in excess of our insurance coverage out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results. We face risks associated with product warranties. We could incur substantial costs as a result of product failures for which we are responsible under warranty obligations. Because we derive a significant amount of our revenue from international sales, we are susceptible to currency fluctuations, long payment cycles, credit risks and other risks associated with conducting business overseas. We sell a significant amount of our products and services outside the United States. International product revenue consists of sales from our foreign subsidiary, distributors in Japan, Europe, Australia, Asia\Pacific Rim and South and Central America and sales shipped directly to international locations from the United States. We expect that international sales will continue to be significant. As a result, a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales, including but not limited to political and economic instability and difficulties in managing our foreign operations. In particular, longer payment cycles common in foreign markets, credit risk and delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign certification or regulatory approvals for products may occur. In addition, significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability, or could cause prospective customers to push out orders to later dates because of the increased relative cost of our products in the aftermath of a currency devaluation or currency fluctuation. We are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. We do not actively hedge our exposure to currency rate fluctuations. While we transact business primarily in U.S. dollars, and a significant proportion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion of our costs and revenue is denominated in other currencies, such as the Euro and Australian dollar. As a result, changes in the exchange rates of these currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect our net income. 22 To successfully grow our international presence, we must address many issues with which we have little or no experience. We may not be able to properly manage our foreign subsidiaries which may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. We have two international subsidiaries which are located in The Netherlands and Australia. In managing foreign operations, we must address many issues with which we have little or no experience which exposes our business to additional risk. Our foreign operations redirect managements time from other operating issues. We may not be successful in operating our foreign subsidiaries. If we are unsuccessful in managing our foreign subsidiaries, the foreign subsidiaries could be unprofitable and negatively impact our resources and financial position. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability and we may seek additional financing to grow the business. Although we have generated a profit in recent years, we incurred a loss in during 2008 and have a history of losses. We may not be able to regain, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis due to many factors including lower demand for our products by practitioners, including practitioners postponing their buying decisions due to the weakening economy, the tightening of the credit market, and other factors. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could decline. We may determine, depending upon the opportunities available, to seek additional debt or equity financing to fund the costs of expansion. Additionally, if we incur indebtedness to fund increased levels of accounts receivable, finance the acquisition of capital equipment, or if we issue debt securities in connection with any acquisition we will be subject to risks associated with incurring substantial additional indebtedness. The liquidity and market value of our investments may decrease. As of December 31, 2008, we held approximately $4.5 million of auction-rate securities. Recently, there have been disruptions in the market for auction-rate securities related to liquidity which has caused substantially all auctions to fail. All of our securities held as of December 31, 2008 failed in their last auction. We will not be able to access our investments in ARS until future auctions are successful, ARS are called for redemption by the issuers, or until we sell the securities in a secondary market. In the event that we are unable to sell the underlying securities at or above par, these securities may not provide us a liquid source of cash in the future. At December 31, 2008, due to the uncertainty and illiquidity in this market, we have classified our auction-rate securities as non-current assets and have recorded an unrealized loss of $588,000 in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. The recovery of these investments is based upon market factors which are not within our control. We will continue to evaluate whether the impairment is temporary. We have both the intent and ability to hold the remaining securities until either a market recovery, redemptions at par value, or maturity occurs. Our common stock could be further diluted by the conversion of outstanding options and warrants. In the past, we have issued and still have outstanding convertible securities in the form of options and warrants. We may continue to issue options, warrants and other equity rights as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees, directors and consultants or others who provide services to us. We have a substantial number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion and exercise of these securities. Such a conversion would dilute our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our charter documents, Delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may discourage potential takeover attempts. Our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock. Our By-laws require a stockholder to provide to our Secretary advance notice of director nominations and business to be brought by such stockholder before any annual or special meeting of stockholders, as well as certain information regarding such nomination and/or business, the stockholder and others known to support such proposal and any material interest they may have in the proposed business. They also provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors. These provisions could delay any stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding stock until the next stockholders meeting. In addition, the board of directors is authorized to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock that, if issued, could dilute and adversely affect various rights of the holders of common stock and, in addition, could be used to discourage an unsolicited attempt to acquire control of us. 23 We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 may limit the ability of stockholders to approve a transaction that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions of our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law could deter certain takeovers or tender offers or could delay or prevent certain changes in control or our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. In April 1999, we adopted a shareholder rights agreement or poison pill. This is intended to protect shareholders from unfair or coercive takeover practices. On October 28, 2008, we amended and restated the April 1999 shareholder rights agreement to (i) extend the expiration date to October 28, 2018, (ii) increase the purchase price to $200.00, (iii) amend the definition of Acquiring Person to exclude a Person qualified to file Schedule 13G as provided in the definition, (iv) amend the recitals to take account of the Recapitalization that occurred May 7, 1999, and (v) make any other additional changes deemed necessary. For more information, please see the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated October 28, 2008 filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 31, 2008. Any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. From time to time, we evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies, as well as consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate any businesses, products or technologies that we acquire. Any acquisition we pursue could diminish our cash available to us for other uses or be dilutive to our stockholders, and could divert managements time and resources from our core operations. Our stock price may be volatile. Our common stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: o acceptance and success of new products or technologies; o the success of competitive products or technologies; o regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; o developments or disputes concerning patents or other foreign countries; o the recruitment or departure of key personnel; o variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; o market conditions in our industry and issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations; and o general economic, industry and market conditions. 24 Item 1B.
