Risk factors, which may affect Coles Myers future performance, are discussed in Item 3D. 1 Table of Contents ITEM 1 IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT & ADVISERS Not applicable. ITEM 2 OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE Not applicable. ITEM 3 KEY INFORMATION A. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected income statement data for 2003 through 2005, and the selected balance sheet data at July 25, 2004 and July 31, 2005 set forth below (other than percentages) are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Coles Myer included in this Annual Report. They should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, those statements, including the Notes thereto. The selected income statement data for the years 2001 and 2002 and the selected balance sheet data at July 29, 2001, July 28, 2002 and July 25, 2003 set forth below (other than percentages) are derived from audited consolidated financial statements of Coles Myer, which are not included herein. Coles Myers consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Australia (Australian GAAP), which vary in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). A reconciliation to U.S. GAAP is set out in Note 32 of the Notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. It should be noted that results for 2005 reflect 53 trading weeks compared to 52 trading weeks for the other fiscal years indicated. This is because the Companys fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in July each year and, as a result, approximately every six years an extra trading week is included in the Companys consolidated results for that fiscal year. 2 Table of Contents Amounts in accordance with Australian GAAP 2005(1)(2)US$ 2005(2) A$ 2004 A$ 2003 A$ 2002(3) A$ 2001(3) A$ (In millions, except per share amounts) Income Statement Data: Sales (3) 27,479.0 36,185.2 32,082.2 26,875.8 25,688.7 23,779.6 Percent increase/(decrease) from prior year n/a 12.8 % 19.4 % 4.6 % 8.0 % (1.6 )% Profit from ordinary activities before income tax 670.2 882.5 866.2 608.8 482.2 208.2 Income tax expense (202.3 ) (266.4 ) (258.1 ) (187.7 ) (137.2 ) (68.0 ) Net profit 467.9 616.1 608.1 421.1 345.0 140.2 Percent increase/(decrease) from prior year n/a 1.3 % 44.4 % 22.1 % 146.1 % (49.6 )% Dividends (4) 331.7 436.8 367.5 348.2 346.9 444.5 Per Ordinary Share: - Basic earnings 0.35 0.46 0.46 0.32 0.25 0.10 - Diluted earnings 0.36 0.47 0.47 0.33 0.27 0.11 - Cash Dividends (4) (5) 0.237 0.313 0.265 0.260 0.255 0.355 Balance Sheet Data: (at year end) Current assets 3,261.1 4,294.3 4,569.5 4,116.4 4,016.8 3,946.1 Total assets 7,102.2 9,352.4 9,051.7 8,452.8 8,320.6 8,317.8 Short-term debt 164.0 216.0 261.5 10.8 15.3 127.8 Long-term debt 921.4 1,213.3 713.4 1,143.3 1,552.8 1,671.4 Total debt 1,085.4 1,429.3 974.9 1,154.1 1,568.1 1,799.2 Net Assets/Shareholders equity 2,837.1 3,736.0 4,097.6 3,799.2 3,338.8 3,286.3 Refer page 4 for notes relating to above table. 3 Table of Contents Amounts in accordance with U.S. GAAP 2005(1)(2)US$ 2005 A$ 2004 A$ 2003 A$ 2002(3) A$ 2001(3) A$ (In millions, except per share amounts) Income Statement Data: Sales (3) 27,479.0 36,185.2 32,082.2 26,875.8 25,688.7 23,779.6 Net profit from continuing operations 389.2 512.5 475.4 444.4 310.7 166.5 - Basic earnings per share 0.32 0.42 0.40 0.34 0.22 0.12 - Diluted earnings per share 0.31 0.41 0.39 0.33 0.22 0.12 Net profit 389.2 512.5 475.4 390.9 310.7 166.5 - Basic earnings per share 0.32 0.42 0.40 0.29 0.22 0.12 - Diluted earnings per share 0.31 0.41 0.39 0.29 0.22 0.12 Per Ordinary Share: - Cash dividends (4) 0.24 0.313 0.265 0.260 0.255 0.355 - Cash dividends inUS$ (4) (5) US$0.24 US$0.24 US$0.19 US$0.18 US$0.14 US$0.18 Balance Sheet Data: (at year end) Current assets 3,264.3 4,298.5 4,577.7 4,128.0 4,034.8 3,940.2 Total assets 6,93.7 9,170.9 9,109.9 8,422.4 8,218.8 8,181.9 Short-term debt 164.0 216.0 261.5 10.8 15.3 127.8 Long-term debt 921.4 1,213.3 1,397.5 1,143.3 1,552.8 1,671.4 Total debt 1,085.4 1,429.3 1,659.0 1,154.1 1,568.1 1,799.2 Net Assets/Shareholders equity 2,506.9 3,301.2 3,032.7 3,329.4 3,107.6 3,111.1 Issued capital - value 1,597.0 2,103.0 1,626.1 2,210.3 2,032.3 1,973.7 Millions of shares Issued capital - number of outstanding shares (6) 1,237.2 1,237.2 1,225.5 1,212.5 1,184.7 1,176.8 (1) Merely for the convenience of the reader, certain selected financial data has been converted into US dollars at the Noon Buying Rate on July 29, 2005, the last trading day of the fiscal year, of A$1.00 = US$0.7594.

RISK FACTORS This section describes some of the risks that could affect the Companys business. The factors below should be considered in connection with any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces  some risks may not be known to the Company, and some, which are not currently considered to be material, could later turn out to be material. 5 Table of Contents The major risk factors, which may impact Coles Myer, include: Risks Related to Coles Myer There is a risk that if the Companys strategic plan is not clearly defined and communicated, the Company will be unsuccessful in fulfilling its vision to be the market leader in all the markets it operates in. The Companys vision is to be the market leader in all the markets it operates in. This strategy has to be clearly defined. Well-judged customer propositions and successful marketing programs influence the continued growth of retail profitability. Critical factors to Coles Myer maintaining its competitive position are: (i) the ability of Coles Myer to successfully gauge and satisfy consumer preferences, and to reward customer loyalty; (ii) merchandising skills to enable improvement in product range to better meet customer needs; (iii) ability to source products in a timely and efficient manner; and (iv) appropriate price positioning. The Company needs an appropriate framework of structures and processes that support the Group through the implementation of this strategy. If the appropriate structures and processes are not in place, the Company may miss or have inadequate responses to the market and new market opportunities. There is a risk that the Company may not fully realize expected benefits and reduce costs from better leverage of the Groups operations. The Groups future plans include expected benefits from greater efficiencies in areas that are common across the Group (in particular Supply Chain and Information Technology) and access to greater economies of scale. There is a risk that the Company may not leverage the benefits and reduce costs, available from the scale, depth and breadth of its retail capability. If the Company is not able to realize these benefits, its future ability to reduce costs and remain competitive may be reduced. There is a risk that the Company may put too much focus on Group change. The Company continues to have a significant agenda of implementing change across the Group, particularly in Retail Support areas such as Supply Chain and Information Technology. There is a risk that if the change agenda is not well managed, there may be a loss of focus with inadequate resources being directed to core retail activities. If these core retail activities do not perform in line with expectations, there is a risk that the Companys future financial performance may suffer. There is a risk that the Companys customer proposition is unsuccessful, which may affect its future competitive position and growth opportunities. Coles Myers vision is to be the number one retailer in its brands, most of which operate in relatively mature retail markets. The Company must regularly evaluate its customer proposition for each of its brands in a dynamic and competitive marketplace. Growth initiatives are based on (i) expanding share within existing markets through differentiated product offers and competitive pricing or (ii) identifying new retail opportunities. In the Food and Liquor business, this includes successfully executing the planned expansion of house brands and increasing fresh food market shares. There is a risk that if the Company does not continue to innovate and improve its customer offer, its market share and future growth may be impacted. If Coles Myer is unable to locate appropriate store sites, it may not be able to deliver expected store growth. The Companys growth strategy includes the opening of new stores, together with the enhancement of existing stores. Coles Myers ability to open new stores is dependent on identifying and entering into leases on commercially reasonable terms for properties that are suitable for its needs. If Coles Myer fails to identify and enter into leases at premium retail sites, the Companys growth may be impaired. There is a risk that some of the Companys stores may underperform. Individual stores may underperform for a number of reasons (eg poor positioning, poor execution, fluctuations in trends and markets, and the Companys failure or inability to swiftly respond to these). There is a risk that the cost of exiting such low returning sites may be prohibitive. If the Company fails to regularly monitor underperforming stores, and to take appropriate remedial action, such stores will adversely affect profitability. 6 Table of Contents There is a risk that if the Company is unable to implement its new Information Technology (IT) systems and transform the Supply Chain the future performance of the Group may be affected. The Companys growth strategy includes significant investment in new IT systems. Coles Myer has a large number of systems, and there is a risk that if CML does not adequately implement the IT strategy to support improvement and efficiency across the business, its future profitability may be affected. The transformation of the Supply Chain is a major initiative for the Company, and is intended to result in doing business better for customers, simpler for stores and cheaper for Coles Myer. The initiative is complex, with risks including delays and interruptions. Presently, the Supply Chain is changing rapidly, and consequently the risk of interruption increases. These risks may result in the Company not achieving the expected benefits within expected timeframes. There is a risk that the Companys growth strategy may be affected if there are insufficient skills across the Group to support its implementation. There is a risk of the loss of key members of the senior management team, which may impede the implementation of the Groups strategies. The loss of key personnel, or insufficient management or leadership skills may mean that the Companys growth strategy does not meet expectations. There is a risk that industrial action may affect the Companys operations impacting business and financial performance. Coles Myer has traditionally had a stable industrial relations environment within its operations. However, there is a risk of industrial unrest or interruption particularly within distribution centers. Any industrial action may increase costs, impact operations and delay transformation initiatives. There is a trend of increasing competition (from existing and new competitors) in the markets within which Coles Myer operates which may affect the results from its retail operations. There is significant competition in the Australian and New Zealand markets in which Coles Myers businesses operate. Retail chains generally compete on the basis of location, quality of products, service, price, product variety and store condition. Take-over activity amongst existing competitors intensifies competition. There is also the risk of new entrants into the Australian retail market, either by acquisition of an existing retailing company or through greenfields development. Regulatory authorities may constrain the Company from growing existing Brands, particularly within the food and liquor group. As Coles Myer operates in a broad range of retail sectors (food and liquor, discount stores, department stores, etc) it is exposed to competition in almost all retail sectors of the Australian market. These competitive conditions may adversely impact Coles Myers market share and trading results. Myer ownership options risk. As part of the development of the Companys next strategic plan, the Company is considering ownership options for Myer. Amongst these is the option of selling, de-merging or retaining Myer. At this point in time the outcome of this process is unknown and consequently it is not possible to reasonably identify what risks, if any, may arise from the final ownership decision. Coles Myer faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims and adverse publicity. The packaging, marketing, distribution and sale of food products entail an inherent risk of product liability, product recall, adverse publicity and exposure to product liability claims. Such claims may have an adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) may affect the Companys operating results. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, CML complies with Accounting Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), Urgent Issues Group Consensus Views and the Corporations Act 2001. The AASB is adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for application to reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005. The AASB has issued Australian equivalents to IFRS (A-IFRS). The adoption of A-IFRS will be first reflected in the CML Groups financial statements for fiscal 2006, being the half year ending January 29, 2006 and the year ending July 30, 2006. 7 Table of Contents The transitional rules for adoption of IFRS require the restatement of comparative financial statements using Australian equivalents of IFRS, except for AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Most adjustments required on transition to IFRS will be made, retrospectively, against opening retained earnings as at July 26, 2004. The adoption of IFRS may increase the volatility of reported earnings in future periods, or negatively impact reported earnings. Refer to note 1ae to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our adoption of IFRS. There is a risk that if the Company is not able to improve its Health and Safety record, the associated costs may decrease profitability. Continuing to improve the Health and Safety record is a major management focus through the Safety Right Now program. This program focuses on creating a safer environment for staff, customers and visitors to all business locations. There is a risk that if the Company is not able to maintain the improving Health and Safety record, the costs associated with workers compensation may increase and affect the future competitive position of the Company. There is a risk that long-term exchange rate fluctuations may impact the costs of imports. The Company sources merchandise both directly and indirectly from overseas denominated in either Australian dollars or foreign currency. All foreign exchange exposures arising from the importation of merchandise (including freight and customs), capital expenditure and other goods (for example back of house items, fees and expenses), and also foreign currency denominated borrowings, and offshore investments are fully hedged. There is a risk that long-term permanent depreciation of the Australian dollar may impact the Companys future sourcing costs. There is a risk of non-compliance with governance, corporations law and other listed company obligations and expectations which may have a negative impact on the Companys performance. Coles Myer is subject to many laws and regulations including, but not limited to, trade practices, corporations law, employment laws, workers compensation and rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, tax and accounting legislation including the Financial Services Act, State, Territory and local government legislation and regulations that govern property planning issues, liquor licensing, tobacco retailing, retail trading hours and other operational matters, environmental regulation and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws (which may be brought about by interest lobby groups) may reduce the sales and profitability of Coles Myers operations and may otherwise adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results. Risks Related to Australia The Companys financial prospects, both in terms of sales and profits are primarily dependent on the Australian economic environment. The retail trading environment is subject to general economic conditions in the Australian and global markets. Any adverse changes in such economic conditions can be expected to affect the retail-trading environment in general. Recent unexpected increases in energy costs have impacted the level of disposable income available to consumers to spend in the Companys stores. Adverse developments in economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year of Coles Myer, particularly the Christmas trading period when its sales and profitability are typically strongest, may have a negative impact on Coles Myers trading results. The Companys future financial results, in terms of sales and borrowing costs, may be negatively impacted by higher interest rates. Higher interest rates affect income available for spending, which can impact the level of retail sales. Higher interest rates also affect the Companys cost of borrowing and may reduce its profitability. Acts of terrorism in Australia may affect the Company. In the event of acts of local terrorism, the Company may experience business interruption. 8 Table of Contents
