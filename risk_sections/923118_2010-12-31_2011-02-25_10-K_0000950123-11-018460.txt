Item 1A. Risk Factors As used in this section, references to we or us or our refer to the Company, the Operating Partnership, and HPRS, taken as a whole. Our business is subject to uncertainties and risks. Please carefully consider the risk factors described below, which apply to Home Properties, the Operating Partnership, and HPRS, in addition to other risks and factors set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or prospects. The risk factors we describe contain or refer to certain forward-looking statements. You should review the explanation of the limitations of forward-looking statements contained in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements on Page 56 of this Form 10-K. Real Estate Investment Risks We are subject to risks that are part of owning residential real estate. Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. If our communities do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. A multifamily apartment communitys revenues and value may be adversely affected by general economic conditions (including unemployment); local economic conditions; local real estate considerations (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for apartments); the perception by prospective residents of the convenience and attractiveness of the communities or neighborhoods in which they are located and the quality of local schools and other amenities; and increased operating costs (including real estate taxes and utilities). Certain significant fixed expenses are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community. We depend on rental income for cash flow to pay expenses and make distributions. We are dependent on rental income from our multifamily properties to pay operating expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, and in order to generate cash to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders. If we are unable to attract and retain residents or if our residents are unable, due to an adverse change in the economic condition of the region or otherwise, to pay their rental obligations, our ability to make expected distributions will be adversely affected. In addition, the weather and other factors outside of our control can result in an increase in the operating expenses for which we are responsible. Attractive acquisitions may not be available and acquisitions we may be able to make may fail to meet expectations. We plan to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. We expect that other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension funds, other REITs and other well-capitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our growth and profitability. If we are able to make acquisitions, there are risks that those acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations. Our estimates of future income, expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to operate an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and we may not be able to respond to changing conditions quickly. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, we have limited ability to adjust our portfolio quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, the prohibition in the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) on REITs holding property for sale and related regulations may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting distributions to stockholders. A number of our properties were acquired using UPREIT Units and nineteen of those properties are subject to certain agreements which may restrict our ability to sell such properties in transactions that would create current taxable income to the former owners. 13 Table of Contents Real Estate Investment Risks (continued) Competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rents. Our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents, including other rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment units and to increase or maintain rental rates. The recent challenges in the credit and housing markets have increased housing inventory that may compete with our properties. Repositioning and development risks could affect our profitability. A key component of our strategy is to acquire properties and to reposition them for long-term growth. In addition, we have developed and are in the process of developing new apartment communities. We plan to continue to selectively expand our development activities. Development projects generally require various governmental and other approvals, which have no assurance of being received. Our repositioning and development activities generally entail certain risks, including the following:  funds may be expended and managements time devoted to projects that may not be completed due to a variety of factors, including without limitation, the inability to obtain necessary zoning or other approvals;  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project economically unfeasible or the economic return on a repositioned property less than anticipated;  projects may be delayed due to delays in obtaining necessary zoning and other approvals, adverse weather conditions, labor shortages, or other unforeseen complications;  occupancy rates and rents at a completed development project or at a repositioned property may be less than anticipated; and  the operating expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated. These risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. Further, the repositioning and development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments. Short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market conditions. Virtually all of the leases for our properties are short-term leases (generally, one year or less). Typically, our residents can leave after the end of a one-year lease term. As a result, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market conditions more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could adversely affect us in a material way. The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended and rental loss insurance for each of our properties. There are however certain types of extraordinary losses, such as losses for certain natural catastrophes, for which the Company may not have insurance coverage. If an uninsured loss occurred, we could lose our investment in and cash flow from, the affected property, and could be required to repay any indebtedness secured by that property and related taxes and other charges. 14 Table of Contents Real Estate Investment Risks (continued) Insurance costs and policy deductibles expose us to unpredictable expenses which may be material. The Companys general liability, property and workers compensation policies provide for deductibles and self-insured retention amounts. These deductibles and self-insured retention amounts expose the Company to potential uninsured losses. Management believes that this exposure is justified by savings in insurance premium amounts and, in some cases, was necessary in order for the Company to secure coverage. Depending on the level of claims experienced, insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain at the current premium and expense levels. Changes in applicable laws, or noncompliance with applicable laws, could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability. We must operate our properties in compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations. Noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability. Compliance with changes in: (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions; (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws; or (iii) other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of our communities, including changes to building codes and fire and life-safety codes, may result in lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures. We may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather. In every market except Florida, we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather, including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice. In addition, in Southeast Florida, we have exposure to severe storms which could also increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities in that region. We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, we may be required, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances at our properties and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property, personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination. These damages and costs may be substantial. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate the contamination, may adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent the affected property. The development, construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances, which regulate matters including wetlands protection, storm water runoff and wastewater discharge. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties. We do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws. Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances govern the removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials (ACMs) when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building. These laws and the common law may impose liability for release of ACMs and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to ACMs. ACMs are present at only several of our communities. We implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which ACMs are detected. We do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of ACMs at our communities. 15 Table of Contents Real Estate Investment Risks (continued) We are aware that some of our communities have or may have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities to contain, remove or test for lead paint to limit the exposure of our residents. We do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities. All of the Owned Properties and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a Phase I or similar environmental assessment, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling. These assessments, together with subsurface assessments conducted on some of our properties, have not revealed, and we are not otherwise aware of, any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition or results of operation. There is no assurance that Phase I assessments would reveal all environmental liabilities. In addition, environmental conditions not known to the Company may exist now or in the future which could result in liability to the Company for remediation or fines, either under existing laws and regulations or future changes to such requirements. Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures, and the need to remediate such mold, is not a new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic or other reactions. There have been only limited cases of mold identified to us. We do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities relating to mold. Additionally, we occasionally have been involved in managing, leasing and operating various properties for third parties. Consequently, we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances. We are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed by us for such third parties. We may incur increased energy and other costs resulting from the climate change regulations. The current concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions. The Company believes these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy and waste removal costs at our properties to increase, but we do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations. Increased costs relating to energy either would be the responsibility of our residents directly or in large part may be passed through by us to our residents through the utility recovery programs. We may be able to pass increased waste removal costs on to our residents in the form of increased rental rates. If this is not possible, it is still not expected that these additional costs would affect the Companys financial performance in any material way. Financing and compliance requirements could limit our income and the ability to raise rents. As a requirement relating to some of our financing, or, in some instances, relating to zoning or other municipal approvals, we have committed to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds and/or to limit rent increases. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 10% of our apartment units were under some form of such limitations. These commitments typically expire after a period of time, and may limit our ability to raise rents aggressively and, in consequence, can also limit increases in the value of the communities subject to these restrictions. 16 Table of Contents Real Estate Financing Risks We are subject to general risks related to debt. We are subject to the customary risks associated with debt financing. For example, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet its debt service obligations, the property could be foreclosed upon. This could adversely affect our cash flow and, consequently, the amount available for distributions to stockholders. We may not be able to obtain refinancing at favorable rates. Because a significant amount of our financing is not fully self-amortizing, we anticipate that only a portion of the principal of our indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity. So, we will need to refinance debt. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will not be successful in refinancing existing indebtedness or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing indebtedness. We aim to stagger our debt maturities with the goal of minimizing the amount of debt which must be refinanced in any year. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.4 billion of mortgage debt, a significant portion of which is subject to balloon payments. We do not expect to have cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments. The mortgage debt matures as follows: 2011 $ 45 million 2012 125 million 2013 193 million 2014 103 million 2015 264 million Thereafter 1,694 million Financing may not be available and issuing equity could dilute our stockholders interests. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. Debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, or on favorable terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. Potential reduction or elimination of the role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play in the multifamily financing sector may negatively impact the multifamily sector and our ability to obtain financing. We have benefited from our ability to borrow from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs). The United States Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development recently issued a report calling for the winding down of the role that the GSEs play in the mortgage market. The report does not identify a specific proposal for dealing with the GSEs multifamily programs. We expect that the options laid out in the report for winding down the GSEs will be the subject of extensive discussions and deliberations and it is not now possible to predict what impact the conclusions reached may have on financing for the multifamily sector and thus on our business. If the GSEs were to exit the multifamily mortgage market, it could negatively impact our ability to obtain financing at favorable rates. Management believes, based on the positive performance of the multifamily sector and its low mortgage default rate, that other sources of financing would enter the market such as pension funds and insurance companies. 17 Table of Contents Real Estate Financing Risks (continued) The Company in part relies on its line of credit to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had an unsecured line of credit agreement with M&T Bank, as administrative agent and lead bank, of $175 million which was set to expire August 31, 2011, with an optional one-year extension. On February 10, 2011, the Company amended and extended this line of credit agreement. The amended line of credit agreement expires August 31, 2012, not including a one-year extension, at the Companys option. The Company had $56.5 million outstanding under the credit facility on December 31, 2010. The credit agreement relating to the line of credit requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants, ratios and measurements. Maintaining compliance with these covenants could limit our flexibility. In addition, a default in these requirements, if uncured, could result in a termination of the line of credit and a requirement that we repay outstanding amounts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs. If noteholders exercise their repurchase right, we may not be able to access the capital necessary to repurchase the notes on attractive terms. In 2006, the Company issued $200 million of exchangeable notes with a coupon rate of 4.125%. The outstanding principal balance of the notes is $140 million. Holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase the notes on November 1, 2011. Based on the fact that the current stock price for the Companys common stock is well below the exchange rate on the notes, we anticipate that the holders will exercise their repurchase rights. We plan to access the capital needed to pay off the noteholders from a number of possible sources including: using unencumbered assets to raise secured debt proceeds; increasing the Companys current line of credit; and issuing equity under the ATM program. There can be no assurance that additional secured financing will be available at attractive terms or that we will be able to increase the line of credit or sell equity at attractive pricing. In the alternative, we might be forced to sell some of our properties at otherwise unacceptable prices or to issue equity at prices that would dilute the interests of our current stockholders. Rising interest rates could adversely affect operations and cash flow. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 90% of our debt was at fixed rates. This limits our exposure to changes in interest rates. Prolonged interest rate increases, however, could negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions, to dispose of properties at favorable prices, to develop properties and to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates. There is no legal limit on the amount of debt we can incur. The Board has adopted a policy of limiting our indebtedness to approximately 55% of our total market capitalization (with the equity component of total market capitalization based on the per share NAV presented to our Board at its most recent Board meeting), but our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount or percentage of indebtedness we may incur. Accordingly, the Board could alter or eliminate its current policy on borrowing. If this policy were changed, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders and increase the risk of default on our indebtedness. Our NAV fluctuates based on a number of factors. Our line of credit agreement limits the amount of indebtedness we may incur. 18 Table of Contents Federal Income Tax Risks There is no assurance that we will continue to qualify as a REIT. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in such manner so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Service Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994. A REIT generally is not taxed at the corporate level on income it currently distributes to its shareholders as long as it distributes currently at least 90% of its taxable income (excluding net capital gains). No assurance can be provided, however, that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that new legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. We are required to make certain distributions to qualify as a REIT, and there is no assurance that we will have the funds necessary to make the distributions. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we currently are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains). In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which certain distributions made by us with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income for that year, and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from the Operating Partnership. However, differences in timing between taxable income and cash available for distribution could require us to borrow funds or to issue additional equity to enable us to meet the 90% distribution requirement (and, therefore, to maintain our REIT qualification) and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax. The Operating Partnership is required to pay (or reimburse us, as its general partner, for) certain taxes and other liabilities and expenses that we incur, including any taxes that we must pay in the event we were to fail to qualify as a REIT. In addition, because we are unable to retain earnings (resulting from REIT distribution requirements), we will generally be required to refinance debt that matures with additional debt or equity. There can be no assurance that any of these sources of funds, if available at all, would be available to meet our distribution and tax obligations. Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have adverse consequences. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. In addition, unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification is lost. The additional tax burden on us would significantly reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders. Our failure to qualify as a REIT could reduce materially the value of our common stock and would cause all our distributions to be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (although, subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to these distributions). The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership but there is no guaranty that it will qualify. We believe that the Operating Partnership qualifies as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No assurance can be provided, however, that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) will not challenge its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were to be successful in treating the Operating Partnership as an entity that is taxable as a corporation, we would cease to qualify as a REIT because the value of our ownership interest in the Operating Partnership would exceed 5% of our assets and because we would be considered to hold more than 10% of the voting securities of another corporation. Also, the imposition of a corporate tax on the Operating Partnership would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its limited partners. Finally, the classification of the Operating Partnership as a corporation would cause its limited partners to recognize gain (upon the event that causes the Operating Partnership to be classified as a corporation) at least equal to their negative capital accounts (and possibly more, depending upon the circumstances). 19 Table of Contents Other Risks The ability of our stockholders to effect a change of control is limited by certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation as well as by Maryland law and our executive retention plan. Our Articles Incorporation, as amended (the Articles of Incorporation), authorize the Board to issue up to a total of 80 million shares of common stock, 10 million shares of excess stock and 10 million shares of preferred stock and to establish the rights and preferences of any shares issued. Further, under the Articles of Incorporation, the stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of its taxable year. We have limited ownership of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock by any single stockholder to 8.0% of the aggregate value of our outstanding shares. The percentage ownership limit described above, the issuance of preferred stock in the future and the absence of cumulative voting rights could have the effect of: (i) delaying or preventing a change of control of us even if a change in control were in the stockholders interest; (ii) deterring tender offers for our common stock that may be beneficial to the stockholders; or (iii) limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block of our common stock in excess of the percentage ownership limit or otherwise to effect a change of control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to the provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law. Maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur, which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers, even if they are in our stockholders best interests. In addition, other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit the Board of Directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval (such as classifying our Board such that the entire Board is not up for re-election annually) that, if made or taken, could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control. Also, to assure that our management has appropriate incentives to focus on our business and properties in the face of a change of control situation, we have adopted an executive retention plan which provides some key employees with salary, bonus and some benefits continuation in the event of a change of control. Potential conflicts of interest could affect some Directors decisions. Unlike persons acquiring common stock, certain of our Directors, who constitute less than a majority of the Board, own a significant portion of their interest in us through UPREIT Units. As a result of their status as holders of UPREIT Units, those Directors and other limited partners may have interests that conflict with stockholders with respect to business decisions affecting us and the Operating Partnership. In particular, those Directors may suffer different or more adverse tax consequences than us upon the sale or refinancing of some of the properties as a result of unrealized gain attributable to those properties. Thus, those Directors and the stockholders may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale or refinancing of properties. In addition, those Directors, as limited partners of the Operating Partnership, have the right to approve certain fundamental transactions such as the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating Partnership, merger or consolidation or dissolution of the Operating Partnership and certain amendments to the Operating Partnership Agreement. The future sale of shares under our At-The-Market offering may negatively impact our stock price. In December 2009, the Company filed a Prospectus Supplement pursuant to a previously filed registration statement. Pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement, the Company was authorized to sell up to 3.7 million common shares from time to time in at the market offerings or negotiated transactions (not to exceed $150 million of gross proceeds). By June, 2010, all of the shares available under this offering had been sold. In September 2010, the Company filed an additional Prospectus Supplement pursuant to which it may sell up to 3.6 million additional common shares. Prior to December 31, 2010, the Company has not issued any shares under this second offering. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of the common stock. 20 Table of Contents Item 1B.
