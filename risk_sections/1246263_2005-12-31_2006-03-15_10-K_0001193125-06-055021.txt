ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Risks Inherent in Our Dependence on Distributions from MMP Our only cash-generating asset is our ownership interest in MMPs general partner, which owns the general partner interest and 100% of the incentive distribution rights in MMP, and our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of MMP to make cash distributions to its partners. The amount of cash that MMP can distribute to its partners each quarter, including us, principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:  demand for the petroleum products that MMP transports, stores and distributes;  hazards or operational risks, some of which may not be covered by insurance;  fluctuations in prices of petroleum products and natural gas liquids;  FERC rate regulation or a successful challenge to the rates MMP charges on its petroleum products pipeline system;  the level of competition from other midstream companies; and  our continued success in our operation and management of MMP through our ownership of its general partner. In addition, the actual amount of cash MMP has available for distribution depends on other factors, some of which are beyond its control, including:  the level of capital expenditures it makes;  the availability, if any, and cost of acquisitions;  debt service requirements;  fluctuations in working capital needs;  MMPs ability to make working capital borrowings under its revolving credit agreement to make distributions; 15 Index to Financial Statements  prevailing economic conditions; and  the amount, if any, of cash reserves established by MMPs general partner in its discretion for the proper conduct of MMPs business. Because of these factors, MMP may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to pay its quarterly distribution at current levels. The amount of cash that MMP has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result, MMP may be able to make cash distributions during periods when MMP records losses and may not be able to make cash distributions during periods when MMP records net income. We may not have sufficient cash to pay our estimated initial quarterly distribution or to increase distributions. Because our primary source of operating cash flow consists of cash distributions from MMP, the amount of distributions we are able to make to our unitholders may fluctuate based on the level of distributions MMP makes to its partners, including us. We cannot guarantee that MMP will continue to make quarterly distributions at its current level or any other amount, or increase its quarterly distributions in the future. In addition, while we expect to increase or decrease distributions to our unitholders if MMP increases or decreases distributions to us, the timing and amount of such changes in distributions, if any, will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of any changes in distributions made by MMP to us. Factors such as reserves established by the board of directors of our general partner for G&A expenses and operating expenses, reserves to satisfy our debt service requirements, if any, and reserves for future distributions by us may affect the distributions we make to our unitholders. Prior to making any distributions to our unitholders, we reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred by them on our behalf. Our general partner determines the amount of these reimbursed expenses. The reimbursement of these expenses, in addition to the other factors listed above, could adversely affect the amount of distributions we make to our unitholders. We cannot guarantee that in the future we will be able to pay distributions or that any distributions MMP does pay to us will allow us to pay distributions. The actual amount of cash that is available to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions depends on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control or the control of our general partner. MMPs practice of distributing all of its available cash may limit its ability to grow, which could impact distributions to us and the available cash that we have to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions. Since our only cash-generating asset is our ownership interest in MMPs general partner, which owns the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in MMP, our growth is dependent upon MMPs ability to increase its quarterly cash distributions. Consistent with the terms of its partnership agreement, MMP distributes to its partners most of the cash generated by its operations. As a result, it relies primarily upon external financing sources, including debt and equity issuances, to fund its significant acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. Accordingly, to the extent MMP is unable to finance growth externally, its ability to grow will be impaired because it distributes substantially all of its available cash. If MMP issues additional units and is unable to maintain its distribution level, the cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders could decrease. Also, if MMP incurs additional indebtedness to finance its growth, the increased interest expense associated with such indebtedness may reduce the amount of available cash that we can distribute. MMPs general partner, with our consent, may limit or modify the incentive distributions we are entitled to receive in order to facilitate MMPs growth strategy. Our general partners board of directors can give this consent without a vote of our unitholders. We own the incentive distribution rights in MMP that entitle us to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum of 48%, of any cash distributed by MMP as certain target distribution levels are reached in excess of $0.288750 per MMP unit in any quarter. A substantial portion of the cash flow we receive from MMP is provided by these incentive distribution rights. MMPs board of directors may reduce the incentive distribution rights payable to us with our consent, which we may provide without the approval of our unitholders. Risks Inherent in MMPs Business Because we are substantially dependent on the distributions we receive from MMP, risks to MMPs operations are also risks to us. We have set forth below risks to MMPs business and operations, the occurrence of which could negatively impact its financial performance and decrease the amount of cash it is able to distribute to us. 16 Index to Financial Statements MMPs financial results depend on the demand for the petroleum products that it transports, stores and distributes. Any sustained decrease in demand for petroleum products in the markets served by MMPs assets could result in a significant reduction in the volume of products that MMP transports in its pipeline, stores at its marine terminals and distributes through its inland terminals, and thereby reduce its cash flow and its ability to pay cash distributions. Factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include:  an increase in the market price of petroleum products, which may reduce demand for gasoline and other petroleum products. Market prices for petroleum products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in global and regional supply over which MMP has no control;  a recession or other adverse economic condition that results in lower spending by consumers and businesses on transportation fuels such as gasoline, aviation fuel and diesel;  higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase the cost of gasoline;  an increase in fuel economy, whether as a result of a shift by consumers to more fuel-efficient vehicles, technological advances by manufacturers or federal or state regulations; and  the government-mandated increase in the use of alternative fuel sources, such as fuel cells and solar, electric and battery-powered engines. MMPs business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be covered by insurance. MMPs operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the transportation and distribution of petroleum products and ammonia, including weather-related or other natural causes, ruptures, leaks and fires. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of its related operations. MMP is not fully insured against all risks incident to its business. In addition, as a result of market conditions, premiums for its insurance policies could increase significantly. In some instances, insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist and sabotage acts. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect MMPs financial position, results of operations or cash flows and its ability to pay cash distributions. Fluctuations in market prices of refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids could materially affect MMPs earnings. A third-party supply agreement that MMP assumed in connection with its acquisition of certain pipeline and terminal assets in October 2004 requires it to purchase and maintain certain inventories of petroleum products. In addition, MMP maintains product inventory related to its petroleum products blending and fractionation operations. Significant fluctuations in market prices of petroleum products could result in losses from these operations, thereby reducing the amount of cash MMP generates and its ability to pay cash distributions. Rate regulation or a successful challenge to the rates MMP charges on its petroleum products pipeline system may reduce the amount of cash it generates. The FERC regulates the tariff rates for interstate movements on MMPs petroleum products pipeline system. Shippers may protest MMPs pipeline tariff filings, and the FERC may investigate new or changed tariff rates. Further, other than for rates set under market-based rate authority, the FERC may order refunds of amounts collected under rates that were in excess of a just and reasonable level when taking into consideration its pipeline systems cost of service. In addition, shippers may challenge the lawfulness of tariff rates that have become final and effective. The FERC may also investigate such rates absent shipper complaint. The FERCs ratemaking methodologies may limit MMPs ability to set rates based on its true costs or may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs. The FERCs primary ratemaking methodology is price indexing. MMP uses this methodology to establish its rates in approximately 40% of its interstate markets. The indexing method allows a pipeline to increase its rates by a percentage equal to the change in the PPI-FG to the new ceiling level. If the PPI-FG falls, MMP could be required to reduce its rates that are based on the FERCs price indexing methodology if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate. The FERCs indexing methodology is subject to a five-year review, and in July 2005, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry proposing to continue using the PPI-FG, without adjustment, as the index for oil pipeline rate changes in the next five year period, commencing July 1, 2006. The FERC has not yet issued a decision in this matter. If the FERC continues its policy of using the PPI-FG, changes in the PPI-FG might not fully reflect actual increases in the costs associated with the pipelines subject to indexing, which would impair MMPs ability to recover costs associated with its cost-of-service based rates. 17 Index to Financial Statements The potential for a challenge to MMPs indexed rates creates the risk that the FERC might find some of MMPs indexed rates to be in excess of a just and reasonable levelthat is, a level justified by MMPs cost of service. In such an event, the FERC would order MMP to reduce any such rates and could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the complaint. In July 2004, the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in BP West Coast Products, LLC v. FERC, which upheld, among other things, the FERCs determination that certain rates of SFPP, an interstate petroleum products pipeline, were grandfathered rates under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and that SFPPs shippers had not demonstrated substantially changed circumstances that would justify modification of those rates. The court also vacated the portion of the FERCs decision applying the Lakehead policy. In the Lakehead decision, the FERC allowed an oil pipeline publicly traded partnership to include in its cost-of-service an income tax allowance to the extent that its unitholders were corporations subject to income tax. In May and June 2005, the FERC issued a statement of general policy, as well as an order on remand of BP West Coast, respectively, in which the FERC stated it will permit pipelines to include in cost of service a tax allowance to reflect actual or potential tax liability on their public utility income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests, if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. Whether a pipelines owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although the new policy is generally favorable for pipelines that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails rate risk due to the case-by-case review requirement. In December 2005, the FERC issued its first case-specific oil pipeline review of the income tax allowance issues in the SFPP proceeding, reaffirming its new income tax allowance policy and directing SFPP to provide certain evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance. Further, in the December 2005 order, the FERC concluded that for tax allowance purposes, the FERC would apply a rebuttable presumption that corporate partners of pass-through entities pay the maximum marginal tax rate of 35% and that non-corporate partners of pass-through entities pay a marginal rate of 28%. The FERC indicated that it would address the income tax allowance issues further in the context of SFPPs compliance filing due February 28, 2006. The FERCs BP West Coast remand decision, the new tax allowance policy and the December 2005 order have been appealed to the D.C. Circuit. As a result, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not certain and could result in changes to the FERCs treatment of income tax allowances in cost of service. MMP establishes rates in approximately 60% of its interstate markets using the FERCs market-based ratemaking regulations. These regulations allow MMP to establish rates based on conditions in individual markets without regard to the index or its cost of service. If successfully challenged, the FERC could take away MMPs ability to establish market-based rates. MMP would then be required to establish rates that would be justified on some other basis such as its cost of service. Any reduction in the indexed rates, removal of its ability to establish market-based rates, change in the treatment of income tax allowances or payment of reparations could have a material adverse effect on MMPs results of operations and reduce the amount of cash it generates. Competition could lead to lower levels of profits and reduce the amount of cash MMP generates. MMP faces competition from other pipelines and terminals in the same markets as its assets, as well as from other means of transporting, storing and distributing petroleum products, including from other pipeline systems, terminal operators and integrated refining and marketing companies that own their own terminal facilities. MMPs customers demand delivery of products on tight time schedules and in a number of geographic markets. If MMPs quality of service declines or MMP cannot meet the demands of its customers, they may utilize the services of its competitors. When prices for the future delivery of petroleum products that MMP stores in its marine terminals fall below current prices, customers may be less likely to store these products, thereby reducing MMPs storage revenues. This market condition is commonly referred to as backwardation. When the petroleum products market is in backwardation, the demand for storage capacity at MMPs marine facilities may decrease. If the market becomes significantly backwardated for an extended period of time, the cash flow generated by MMPs marine terminal facilities may be reduced, impacting its ability to pay cash distributions. MMPs business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the environmental and operational safety aspects of its operations. Each of MMPs operating segments is subject to the risk of incurring substantial costs and liabilities under environmental and safety laws and regulations. These costs and liabilities arise under increasingly stringent environmental and safety laws, including regulations and governmental enforcement policies, and as a result of claims for damages to 18 Index to Financial Statements property or persons arising from MMPs operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and, to a lesser extent, issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. If MMP was unable to recover these costs through increased revenues, its ability to meet its financial obligations and pay cash distributions could be adversely affected. The terminal and pipeline facilities that comprise MMPs petroleum products pipeline system have been used for many years to transport, distribute or store petroleum products. Over time its operations, or operations by its predecessors or third parties not under MMPs control, have resulted in the disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes at or from these terminal properties and along such pipeline rights-of-way. In addition, some of MMPs terminals and pipelines are located on or near current or former refining and terminal sites, and there is a risk that contamination is present on those sites. MMP may be subject to strict, joint and several liability under a number of these environmental laws and regulations for such disposal and releases of hydrocarbons or solid wastes or the existence of contamination, even in circumstances where such activities or conditions were caused by third parties not under its control or were otherwise lawful at the time they occurred. For example, on January 13, 2006, MMP experienced a line break and release of approximately 3,200 barrels of gasoline from its petroleum products pipeline near Independence, Kansas. MMP is in the process of remediating the impacts from the release. MMP is also evaluating the estimated repair and remediation costs associated with the release. MMP has insurance coverage for this incident with a deductible of $1.5 million. MMP is unable to estimate with any degree of certainty what penalties, if any, might be assessed by the EPA or other governmental agency. Penalties are not covered by MMPs insurance policy. MMPs cost for repair, remediation and damages plus any penalties that may be assessed are not currently ascertainable, and we cannot assure you that such costs and damages will not have a material effect on MMPs results of operations or cash flows. In addition, MMP owns or leases a number of properties that have been used for many years to distribute or store petroleum products by third parties not under its control. In some cases, predecessor owners, tenants or other users of these properties have disposed of or released hydrocarbons or wastes on or under these properties. Further, the transportation of ammonia by MMPs pipeline is hazardous and may result in environmental damage, including accidental releases that may cause death or injuries to humans and farm animals and damage to crops. MMP depends on refineries and petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by others to supply its pipeline and terminals. MMP depends on connections with refineries and petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by third parties as a significant source of supply for its facilities. Outages at these refineries or reduced or interrupted throughput on these pipelines because of weather-related or other natural causes, testing, line repair, damage, reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in MMP being unable to deliver products to its customers from its terminals, receive products for storage or reduce shipments on its pipelines and could adversely affect its cash flow and ability to pay cash distributions. The closure of mid-continent refineries that supply MMPs petroleum products pipeline system could result in disruptions or reductions in the volumes it transports and the amount of cash it generates. The EPA has adopted requirements that require refineries to install equipment to lower the sulfur content of gasoline and some diesel fuel they produce. The requirements relating to gasoline took effect in 2004, and the requirements relating to diesel fuel will take effect in 2006 and be implemented through 2010. If refinery owners that use MMPs petroleum pipeline system determine that compliance with these new requirements is too costly, they may close some of these refineries, which could reduce the volumes transported on MMPs petroleum products pipelines and the amount of cash it generates. Mergers among MMPs customers and competitors could result in lower volumes being shipped on MMPs pipelines or products stored in or distributed through its terminals, thereby reducing the amount of cash MMP generates. Mergers between MMPs existing customers and MMPs competitors could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing systems instead of MMPs in those markets where the systems compete. As a result, MMP could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers and could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues. Because most of MMPs operating costs are fixed, a reduction in volumes would result not only in less revenues, but also a decline in cash flow of a similar magnitude, which would reduce its ability to pay cash distributions. 19 Index to Financial Statements The pipeline and terminal assets MMP acquired in October 2004 are subject to a consent decree with the EPA, and MMP could incur substantial costs and liabilities to comply with this decree that are not covered by the sellers indemnification. In 2003, the seller of the pipeline and terminal assets that MMP acquired in October 2004 entered into a consent decree with the EPA arising out of a June 1999 incident unrelated to the assets MMP acquired. In order to resolve its civil liability for the incident, the seller agreed to pay civil penalties and to comply with certain terms set out in the consent decree. These terms include requirements for testing and maintenance of a number of the sellers pipelines, including certain of the pipelines MMP acquired, the creation of a damage prevention program, submission to independent monitoring and various reporting requirements. The consent decree imposes penalties for non-compliance for a period of at least five years from the date of the consent decree. Under its purchase agreement, MMP agreed, at its own expense, to complete any remaining remediation work required under the consent decree with respect to these pipelines and assumed a liability of approximately $8.6 million at the time of the acquisition for this remediation work. The seller has agreed to retain responsibility under the consent decree for any ongoing independent monitoring obligations with respect to one of these pipelines. Potential future acquisitions and expansions, if any, may affect MMPs business by substantially increasing the level of its indebtedness and liabilities and increasing its risk of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations. From time to time, MMP evaluates and acquires assets and businesses that it believes complement its existing assets and businesses. Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. If MMP consummates any future acquisitions, its capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses, inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them and new geographic areas and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns. Further, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and MMP may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Following an acquisition, MMP may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which it has no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. MMPs business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the petroleum products that it stores and transports. Petroleum products that MMP stores and transports are sold by its customers for consumption into the public market. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications to commodities sold into the public market. Changes in product quality specifications could reduce MMPs throughput volume, require it to incur additional handling costs or require capital expenditures. For instance, different product specifications for different markets impact the fungibility of the products in its system and could require the construction of additional storage. If MMP is unable to recover these costs through increased revenues, its cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions could be adversely affected. MMPs business is subject to federal EPA requirements that will lower the level of sulfur in diesel fuels beginning in June 2006. Beginning in June 2006, the allowable level of sulfur in on-road and off-road diesel fuel will begin to be lowered to levels substantially below current specifications. This transition will require MMP to invest substantial amounts of capital and incur new operating costs that it may not be able to recover through increased revenues. This transition may require MMP to transfer low sulfur products to higher sulfur products within its system as a result of product contaminations, which could also lead to higher costs. To date, limited testing opportunities have been available for MMP to ensure that its transition plan will be successful due to the lack of product meeting the new low sulfur specifications. Terrorist attacks aimed at MMPs facilities could adversely affect its business. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, in general, and the nations pipeline and terminal infrastructure, in particular, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. The threat of terrorist attacks has subjected MMPs operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack on MMPs facilities, those of its customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, could have a material adverse effect on its business. MMPs ammonia pipeline system is dependent on three customers. Three customers ship all of the ammonia on MMPs ammonia pipeline and utilize its six related terminals. MMP has contracts with these three shippers that expire on June 30, 2008 and obligate them to ship-or-pay for specified minimum quantities of ammonia. The loss of any one of these three customers or their failure or inability to pay MMP could adversely affect its cash flows. 20 Index to Financial Statements High natural gas prices can increase ammonia production costs and reduce the amount of ammonia transported through MMPs ammonia pipeline system. The profitability of MMPs ammonia customers partially depends on the price of natural gas, which is the principal raw material used in the production of ammonia. An extended period of high natural gas prices may cause MMPs customers to produce and ship lower volumes of ammonia, which could adversely affect MMPs cash flows. Rising short-term interest rates could increase MMPs financing costs and reduce the amount of cash it generates. As of December 31, 2005, MMP had fixed-rate debt of $786.9 million outstanding excluding unaccreted discounts and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedges. MMP has effectively converted $350.0 million of this debt to floating-rate debt using interest rate swap agreements. In addition, MMP had $13.0 million of floating rate borrowings outstanding on its revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2005. As a result of these swap agreements and revolver borrowings, MMP has exposure to changes in short-term interest rates. Based on the amounts outstanding on December 31, 2005, if LIBOR were to change by 0.25%, MMPs annual interest expense would change by $0.9 million. Rising short-term rates could reduce the amount of cash MMP generates and adversely affect its ability to pay cash distributions. The terms of MMPs indemnification settlement agreement require Williams to make payments to MMP over the next two years, exposing it to credit risk. In May 2004, we, MMP and its general partner entered into an agreement with Williams under which Williams agreed to pay MMP $117.5 million to release Williams from its environmental and certain other indemnification obligations to MMP, consisting primarily of costs related to environmental remediation matters associated with assets that were contributed to MMP by Williams. MMP has received $62.5 million from Williams as of December 31, 2005, and MMP expects to receive the remaining balance in annual installments of $20.0 million and $35.0 million in July of 2006 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, known liabilities that would have been covered by these indemnifications were $43.1 million. Williams credit ratings are below investment grade. Failure of Williams to perform on its payment obligations under the settlement agreement could adversely affect MMPs ability to meet these obligations and pay cash distributions. Restrictions contained in MMPs debt instruments and the debt instruments of Magellan Pipeline may limit MMPs financial flexibility. MMP and its subsidiary, Magellan Pipeline, are subject to restrictions with respect to their debt that may limit their flexibility in structuring or refinancing existing or future debt and prevent them from engaging in certain beneficial transactions. These restrictions include, among other provisions, the maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on their ability to incur additional indebtedness, to grant liens, to sell assets or to repay existing debt without penalties. These restrictions could result in higher costs of borrowing and impair MMPs ability to generate additional cash. In addition, a change in control of our general partner or MMPs general partner could, under certain circumstances, result in MMPs debt or the debt of Magellan Pipeline becoming due and payable. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us A reduction in MMPs distributions will disproportionately affect the amount of cash distributions to which we are currently entitled. Our ownership of the incentive distribution rights in MMP entitles us to receive specified percentages of total cash distributions made by MMP. Most of the cash we receive from MMP is attributable to our ownership of the incentive distribution rights. Accordingly, any reduction in quarterly cash distributions from MMP would have the effect of disproportionately reducing the amount of the distributions that we receive from MMP. Cost reimbursements due our general partner may be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to holders of our common units. Prior to making any distribution on our common units, we will reimburse our general partner for expenses it incurs on our behalf. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to holders of our common units. Our general partner will determine the amount of its expenses that we must reimburse. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may perform other services for us for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. 21 Index to Financial Statements The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement on the ability of MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P., or any subsequent owner of our general partner, to transfer its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. If MMPs general partner is not fully reimbursed or indemnified for obligations and liabilities it incurs in managing the business and affairs of MMP, it may not be able to satisfy its obligations and its cash flows will be reduced. The general partner of MMP and its affiliates may make expenditures on behalf of MMP for which they will seek reimbursement from MMP. In addition, under Delaware partnership law, Magellan GP, LLC, in its capacity as the general partner of MMP, has unlimited liability for the obligations of MMP, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of MMP that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. To the extent Magellan GP, LLC incurs obligations on behalf of MMP, it is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by MMP. If MMP does not reimburse or indemnify its general partner, Magellan GP, LLC may be unable to satisfy these liabilities or obligations, which would reduce its cash flows. A change in control of us, our general partner or MMPs general partner could increase MMPs G&A expenses, which in turn could reduce MMPs distribution to us. We have entered into the Reimbursement Agreement with MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P. pursuant to which it has agreed to reimburse us for any amounts we pay to MMP pursuant to:  our indemnity obligations to MMP related to certain environmental indemnities we made at the time we acquired our ownership interests in MMP and MMPs general partner;  our obligation to reimburse MMP for certain G&A costs under the omnibus agreement; and  any expenses incurred but not paid that relate to the period prior to the closing of our initial public offering on February 15, 2006. MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P. has escrowed funds which we believe will be sufficient to satisfy its reimbursement obligations to us pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement. The funds in escrow related to the omnibus agreement will be disbursed to the current owners of our general partner upon a change in control of us, our general partner or MMPs general partner. If such a change in control occurs, MMPs G&A expenses will no longer be subject to a cap. The funds in escrow related to the PSA Indemnity will be disbursed to us upon a change in control of us or our general partner. In the event of a change in control, the amount of cash available for distribution from MMP could be reduced because MMP could incur additional G&A expenses. If in the future we cease to manage and control MMP through our ownership of MMPs general partner interest, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we cease to manage and control MMP and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us or our affiliates, and adversely affect the price of our common units. Although we control and manage MMP through our ownership of its general partner, MMPs general partner owes fiduciary duties to MMP and MMPs unitholders, which may conflict with our interests. Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, including MMPs general partner, on the one hand, and MMP and its limited partners, on the other hand. The directors and officers of MMPs general partner have fiduciary duties to manage MMP in a manner beneficial to us, its owner. At the same time, MMPs general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage MMP in a manner beneficial to MMP and its limited partners. The board of directors of MMPs general partner will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our unitholders. 22 Index to Financial Statements For example, conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations:  the allocation of shared overhead expenses to MMP and us;  the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and MMP, on the other hand;  the determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to MMPs partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of MMPs business;  the decision whether MMP should make acquisitions and on what terms;  the determination of whether MMP should use cash on hand, borrow or issue equity to raise cash to finance acquisitions or expansion capital projects, repay indebtedness, meet working capital needs, pay distributions or otherwise; and  any decision we make in the future to engage in business activities independent of MMP. The fiduciary duties of our general partners officers and directors may conflict with those of Magellan GP, LLC, MMPs general partner. Conflicts of interest may arise because of the relationships between MMPs general partner, MMP and us. Our general partners directors and officers have fiduciary duties to manage our business in a manner beneficial to us, our unitholders and the owners of our general partner. Simultaneously, a majority of our general partners directors and all of its officers are also directors and officers of MMPs general partner, and have fiduciary duties to manage the business of MMP in a manner beneficial to MMP and MMPs unitholders. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our unitholders. Potential conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner, its affiliates and us. Our general partner and its affiliates have limited fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders. As of the closing of our initial public offering on February 15, 2006, MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P., in which all three of our executive officers own an interest, will own approximately 65% of our common units and will own 100% of our general partner. Conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following:  our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, including MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P. and their respective affiliates, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders;  our general partner determines whether or not we incur debt and that decision may affect our or MMPs credit ratings;  our general partner has limited its liability and reduced its fiduciary duties under the partnership agreement, while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;  our general partner determines the amount and timing of our investment transactions, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available to to pay distributions to our unitholders;  our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;  our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered, or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, so long as the terms of any such additional contractual arrangements are fair and reasonable to us;  our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates;  our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us;  our general partner determines the allocation of shared overhead expenses to MMP and us; and  our general partner interprets and enforces contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and MMP, on the other hand. 23 Index to Financial Statements Our general partners affiliates may compete with us. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will be restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our general partner and those activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us. Affiliates of our general partner are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. For example, we and our general partner are partially owned by an affiliate of the Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund II, L.P.(CRF), which also owns, through affiliates, an interest in the general partner of Buckeye Partners, L.P. (Buckeye Partners) and an interest in the general partner of SemGroup, L.P. (SemGroup), both of which are engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and may acquire other entities that compete with MMP. Although MMP does not have extensive operations in the geographic areas primarily served by Buckeye Partners, MMP will compete directly with Buckeye Partners, SemGroup and perhaps other entities in which CRF has an interest for acquisition opportunities throughout the United States and potentially will compete with Buckeye Partners, SemGroup and these other entities for new business or extensions of existing services provided by MMPs operating partnerships, creating actual and potential conflicts of interest between MMP and our affiliates. In addition, SemGroup is a customer of MMP. The term loan of MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P. restricts our ability to incur debt. In addition, our ability to obtain debt financing could be affected by MMPs and MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P.s credit ratings. We have entered into a $5.0 million revolving credit facility with MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P. to provide for working capital needs. MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P.s term loan contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and to incur liens to support indebtedness. In order for MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P. to remain in compliance with the terms of its term loan, we must not incur any indebtedness other than borrowings under our $5.0 million revolving credit facility. As a result, if MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P. were unable to fund borrowings under this facility, we could be prevented from borrowing for working capital needs, in which case, we would have to finance our working capital needs from distributions we receive on the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights in MMP that we hold, which would reduce the amount of cash available to meet our financial obligations or pay cash distributions. For more information regarding our revolving credit facility, please read Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. If we decide to obtain our own credit rating, any future downgrading of MMPs or MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P.s credit rating would likely also result in a downgrading of our credit rating. Regardless of whether we have our own credit rating, a downgrading of MMPs or MGG Midstream Holdings, L.P.s credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all. All of our executive officers face conflicts in the allocation of their time to our business. Our general partner shares officers and administrative personnel with MMPs general partner to operate both our business and MMPs business. Our general partners officers, who are also the officers of MMPs general partner, will allocate the time they and our general partners other employees spend on our behalf and on behalf of MMP. These officers face conflicts regarding the allocation of their and our other employees time, which may adversely affect our or MMPs results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. These allocations may not necessarily be the result of arms-length negotiations between MMPs general partner and our general partner. If we or MMP were treated as a corporation for federal income tax or state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. The value of our investment in MMP depends largely on MMP being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which requires that 90% or more of MMPs gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income, as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. MMP may not meet this requirement or current law may change so as to cause, in either event, MMP to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject to federal income tax. Moreover, the anticipated after-tax benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), on this or any other matter affecting us. If MMP were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it would pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%. Distributions to us would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to us. As a result, there would be a material reduction in our cash available to meet our financial obligations or pay cash distributions. 24 Index to Financial Statements If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available to meet our financial obligations or pay cash distributions would be substantially reduced. Current law may change, causing us or MMP to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us or MMP to entity level taxation. For example, because of widespread state budget deficits, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. If any state were to impose a tax upon us or MMP as an entity, our cash available to meet our financial obligations or pay cash distributions would be reduced. The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes. We will be considered to have been terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income.
