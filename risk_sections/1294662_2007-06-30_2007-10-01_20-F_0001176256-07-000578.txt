D. Risk Factors Kimber is subject to a number of significant risks due to the nature of its business and the present stage of its business development. The following factors should be considered: 16 INDUSTRY RISKS Resource exploration and development is a high risk, speculative business. Resource exploration and development is a speculative business, characterized by a high number of failures. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery or ore reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. Mineral exploration is subject to numerous industry operating hazards and risks, many of which are beyond Kimbers control and any one may have an adverse effect on its financial condition and operations. The operations in which Kimber has a direct or indirect interest will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to resource companies, any of which could result in work stoppages and damage to persons or property or the environment and possible legal liability for any and all damage. Fires, power outages, labour disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, land slides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labour are some of the industry operating risks involved in the operation of mines and the conduct of exploration programs. Other risks include injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any of these operating risks and hazards may have an adverse effect on Kimbers financial condition and operations. Kimber will, when appropriate, secure liability insurance in an amount which it considers adequate, however the nature of claims may exceed policy limits, or the liability and hazards might not be insurable. Kimber might elect not to insure itself against such liabilities due to high premium costs or other reasons, in which event Kimber could incur significant costs that may have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition and operations. The economics of developing gold, silver and other mineral properties is affected by many factors including the cost of operations, variations in the grade of ore mined, fluctuations in metal markets, costs of processing equipment and such other factors as government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. The Company does not have producing mines at this time. Properties on which mineral reserves are not found will have to be discarded causing the Company to write each respective property off thus sustaining a loss. Metal prices have fluctuated widely in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future which may adversely affect the amount of revenues derived from production of mineral reserves. Kimber does not hold any known mineral reserves of any kind. Future revenues, if any, are expected to be in large part derived from the future mining and sale of gold and silver or interests related thereto. The prices of these commodities fluctuate and are affected by numerous factors beyond Kimber’s control including: · international economic and political conditions, · expectations of inflation or deflation, · international currency exchange rates, 17 · interest rates, · global or regional consumptive patterns, · speculative activities, · levels of supply and demand, · increased production due to new mine developments, · decreased production due to mine closures, · improved mining and production methods, · availability and costs of metal substitutes, · metal stock levels maintained by producers and others, and · inventory carrying costs. The effect of these factors on the price of base and precious metals, and therefore the economic viability of Kimber’s operations, cannot be accurately predicted. Depending on the price to be received for any minerals produced, Kimber may determine that it is impractical to commence or continue commercial production. The commercial feasibility of the Companys properties and its ability to arrange funding to conduct its planned exploration projects is dependent on the price of gold and silver. The price of gold and silver may also have a significant influence on the market price of the Companys common shares and the value of the Companys properties. A reduction in the price of gold or silver may prevent the Companys properties from being economically mined or result in the write-off of assets whose value is impaired as a result of low precious metals prices. The Company faces substantial competition within the mining industry from other mineral companies with much greater financial and technical resources and may not be able to effectively compete which would have an adverse effect on Kimbers financial condition and operations. The resource industry is intensively competitive in all of its phases, and Kimber competes with many companies possessing much greater financial and technical research resources. Competition is particularly intense with respect to the acquisition of desirable undeveloped gold and silver properties. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such undeveloped properties include the staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and purchase such properties, and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties. Competition could adversely affect Kimbers ability to acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future. The mining industry is facing increasing operating and capital costs which may adversely affect the viability of existing and proposed mining projects. Increasing operating costs are a factor that must be built in to the economic model for any mining project. Significant operating cost increases have been experienced by the industry in recent years, the effect of which has been to reduce profit margin for some mining projects. 18 As a result of the increase in the prices of the labour and materials, to some extent caused by the increase in commodity prices, including the prices of the metals being mined by the industry, the capital cost of mining projects has significantly increased in the past few years. Such increases in both operating and capital costs need to be factored into economic assessments of existing and proposed mining projects and may increase the financing requirements for such projects or render such projects uneconomic. Companies carrying on operations in countries other than their home country are subject to on-going currency risks. Kimber carries on exploration in Mexico. The cost of exploration and future capital and operating costs are affected by foreign exchange rates for the Canadian dollar, United States dollar and Mexican peso. The Company can mitigate the effects of these rate fluctuations, to some extent, through forward purchases. Because of its limited operating record and history of losses, it may not be able to hedge future risk to the extent it feels is warranted. COMPANY RISKS Kimbers exploration and development efforts may be unsuccessful in locating viable mineral resources. Resource exploration and development is a speculative business, characterized by a number of significant risks, including, among other things, unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but also from finding mineral deposits, which, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by the Company on the exploration of its properties as described herein will result in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery or ore reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. Kimber has a limited history as an exploration company and does not have any experience in putting a mining project into production. Kimber has only been actively engaged in exploration since 1999. The Company does not hold any mineral reserves and does not generate any revenues from production. Kimbers success will depend largely upon its ability to locate and develop commercially productive mineral reserves, which may never happen. Further Kimber does not have any experience in taking a Mining project to the production stage. As a result of these factors, it is difficult to evaluate Kimbers prospects, and its future success is more uncertain than if it had a longer or more proven history. The Company may not be able to market the minerals acquired or discovered due to factors beyond the control of the Company. The marketability of minerals acquired or discovered by the Company may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond the control of the Company and which cannot be accurately predicted, such as market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of milling facilities, mineral markets and processing equipment, and such other factors as government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection, the combination of which factors may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. 19 Kimber expects to continue to incur losses and may never achieve profitability, which in turn may harm the future operating performance and may cause the market price of Kimbers Common Shares to decline. Kimber has incurred net losses every year since inception on March 31, 1995 and as of June 30, 2007 had an accumulated deficit of $10,539,847. Kimber incurred a net loss of $3,813,938 for the year ended June 30, 2007 and $2,363,420 for the year ended June 30, 2006 (2005: $1,825,982; 2004: $1,513,811; 2003: $513,627). If Kimber does not achieve a necessary level of profitability it will have to raise additional financing or shut down its operations. Kimber does not hold any known mineral reserves of any kind and may never be able to locate commercially productive mineral reserves. In the event such reserves are discovered, commercial production may not be possible or warranted. All of Kimbers mineral properties are in the exploration stage and are without known mineral reserves. Kimber may discover mineral reserves through its exploration programs but commercial production may not be warranted due to any one or more possible reasons. Few mineral properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. In the event a commercially productive mineral reserve is discovered, substantial expenditures are required to establish mineral reserves through drilling, to develop metallurgical processes for extraction and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at the production site. The marketability of any minerals discovered may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond Kimbers control and which cannot be predicted, such as market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of milling facilities, mineral markets and processing equipment, and such other factors as government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection. Depending on the price of minerals produced, Kimber may determine that it is impractical to commence or continue commercial production. If mineral reserves are not located Kimber will have to raise additional financing to continue exploration on the Monterde Property or the other properties that it owns, or shut down. Kimbers title to its mineral properties and its validity may be disputed in the future by others claiming title to all or part of such properties. Kimber owns the mining concessions, which constitute its property holdings. However, the concessions may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers, which may affect the validity of Kimbers ownership of such concessions. A claim on any of Kimbers mineral properties, especially where commercially productive mineral reserves have been located, could adversely affect Kimbers long-term profitability as it may preclude entirely the economic development of a mineral property. Also, such a claim may potentially affect Kimbers current operations due to the high costs of defending against such claims and its impact on senior management's time. The Companys properties are located in Mexico and are subject to changes in political conditions and regulations in that country. If Kimber is not able to comply with all Mexican laws and regulations, this could negatively impact current or planned exploration and development activities. 20 The Property, the Companys principal project, is located in Mexico. Mexico has in the past been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, which, if they were to arise again, could cause changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. The Companys operations and properties are subject to a variety of governmental regulations including, among others: regulations promulgated by SEMARNAT, Mexicos environmental protection agency; the Mexican Mining Law; and the regulations of the Comisión National del Aqua with respect to water rights. Mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards. The Companys mineral exploration and mining activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to the Company activities or maintaining its properties. Kimber's exploration and development activities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing health and worker safety, employment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development and protection of endangered and protected species and other matters. A number of other approvals, licenses and permits are required for various aspects of mine development. Obtaining and maintaining the necessary permits are critical to Kimber's business and it is uncertain if all necessary permits will be obtained on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. Future changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact current or planned exploration and development activities or any other projects in which Kimber may become involved. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure to obtain or maintain permits, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption of exploration and development operations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities. Operations could also be affected to varying degrees by government regulations with respect to restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, environmental legislation and mine safety, to the extent that such regulations may be imposed. Mexicos status as a developing country may make it more difficult for the Company to obtain any required financing for its projects. Kimber originally contemplated an open pit mining operation on the Carmen deposit however it is currently contemplating the possibility of a combined open pit and underground mining operation, the effect of which, if it were to proceed to production, would expose the Company to additional risks of increased costs, potential time delays and risks to underground workers. The change in concept from an open pit to a combined open pit and underground mining operation will if it proceeds on this basis expose the Company to the inherent risks of underground mining including increased costs, time delays in developing underground operations and safety issues that must be minimized. The development of any mine plan and feasibility study must take these factors into consideration and may negatively impact the viability of the project. Kimber does not currently have an assessment of the economic viability of the Carmen deposit as a combined open pit/underground operation that complies with NI 43-101 standards. The Company has not completed an environmental impact statement (an MIA), nor has it received the necessary permits for water or explosives to conduct mining operations. The Companys current principal property is located in Mexico. The department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is SEMARNAT and has broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with environmental regulations or standards. 21 Regulations require that an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a Manifiesto de Impacto Ambiental (MIA), be prepared by a third-party contractor for submittal to SEMARNAT. An MIA is required prior to mine construction. Studies required to support the MIA include a detailed analysis of the following areas: soil, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The regulatory process in Mexico does not have a public review component but proof of local community support for a project is required to gain final MIA approval. A risk analysis must also be prepared in conjunction with the MIA for approval by SEMARNAT. To date this risk analysis has not been prepared A number of other approvals, licenses and permits are required for various aspects of a mine development. The most significant permits for the development of the Monterde Property, other than MIA approval, are water rights concessions, or permits to extract water, issued by the National Water Commission, and a permit for consumption, use and storage of explosives, or blasting permit, issued by the Mexican National Defence Secretariat. Failure to obtain the necessary permits would adversely affect progress of its operations. The Monterde Property is located in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico which have been subject to episodes of unusually high rainfall in the past two (2) years resulting in washouts and erosion of soil. Continuing increased rainfall may result in increased costs and delays in operations. Seasonal rains are a factor that must be considered when carrying on operations in areas such as the Sierra Madre where excessive rain fall may hamper operations. Some other companies carrying on operations in areas of heavy seasonal rains have been severely impacted by the rainfall and on occasion have been required to cease operations. Kimbers operations may be negatively impacted by such rainfall. Kimber depends on key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts but does not maintain key person insurance. Kimber is dependent on a relatively small number of key personnel, the loss of any of whom could have an adverse effect on the operations of Kimber. Kimbers success is dependent to a great degree on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management personnel. The loss of such key personnel, through incapacity or otherwise, would require Kimber to seek and retain other qualified personnel and could compromise the pace and success of its exploration activities. Kimber does not maintain key person insurance in the event of a loss of any such key personnel. Additionally, Kimber has relied on and is expected to continue relying upon consultants, contractors and others for exploration expertise. In the event a body of ore is discovered on any of Kimbers properties, it will likely require the expertise of such consultants and others for the development and operations of a producing mine. Kimber will need to raise additional capital though the sale of its securities, resulting in dilution to the existing shareholders, and which may not be available, adversely affecting its operations. Kimber does not generate any revenues from production and does not have sufficient financial resources to undertake by itself all of its planned exploration programs. Kimber has limited financial resources and has financed its operations primarily through the sale of Kimbers securities such as Common Shares. 22 Kimber will need to continue its reliance on the sale of its securities for future financing, resulting in dilution to existing shareholders. Kimber anticipates that it will have to obtain additional financing before the end of the first quarter of 2008. Further exploration programs will depend on Kimbers ability to obtain additional financing which may not be available under favourable terms, if at all. If adequate financing is not available, Kimber may not be able to commence or continue with its exploration programs. Future sales of Kimbers Common Shares into the public market may lower the market price, which may result in losses to Kimbers shareholders. As of September 14, 2007 Kimber had 49,848,620 Common Shares issued and outstanding. In addition, as of September 14, 2007 2,270,000 Common Shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, all of which may be exercised in the future resulting in dilution to Kimbers shareholders. Of these amounts, officers and directors of Kimber own, as a group, 8,454,507 Common Shares (16.96%) and stock options to acquire an additional 1,680,000 Common Shares. Kimber may issue stock options to purchase an additional 938,381 Common Shares remaining under its existing stock option plan. Most of these Common Shares, including the Common Shares to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options, are freely tradable. Sales of substantial amounts of Kimbers Common Shares into the public market, or even the perception by the market that such sales may occur, may lower the market price of its Common Shares. Kimber has no history of paying dividends, does not expect to pay dividends in the immediate future and may never pay dividends. Since incorporation, Kimber has not paid any cash or other dividends on its Common Shares and does not expect to pay such dividends in the foreseeable future, as all available funds will be invested primarily to finance its mineral exploration programs. Kimber will need to achieve profitability prior to any dividends being declared, which may never happen. Mexico is a developing country and obtaining financing or finding or hiring qualified people or obtaining all necessary services for the Companys operations in Mexico may be difficult. The Companys principal project is in Mexico which is a developing country and it may be difficult for the Company to obtain necessary financing for its planned exploration or development activities because of their location in Mexico. It may be difficult to find or hire qualified people in the mining industry who are situated in Mexico or to obtain all of the necessary services or expertise in Mexico or to conduct operations on its projects at reasonable rates. If qualified people and services or expertise cannot be obtained in Mexico, the Company may need to seek and obtain those services from people located outside of Mexico which will require work permits and compliance with applicable laws and could result in delays and higher costs to the Company to conduct its operations in Mexico. The Companys business involves uninsurable risks and the Company does not have insurance for these risks. In the course of exploration, development and production of mineral properties, certain risks, and in particular, unexpected or unusual geological operating conditions including rock bursts, cave-ins, fires, flooding and earthquakes may occur. It is not always possible to fully insure against such risks. 23 The Company does not currently have insurance against all such risks and may decide not to take out insurance against all such risks as a result of high premiums or other reasons. Should such liabilities arise, they could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in increasing costs and a decline in the value of the securities of the Company. Kimbers activities are subject to environmental liability, which would have an adverse effect on its financial condition and operations. Kimber is not aware of any claims for damages related to any impact that its operations have had on the environment but it may become subject to such claims in the future. An environmental claim could adversely affect Kimbers business due to the high costs of defending against such claims and its impact on senior management's time. Kimber conducts exploration activities in Mexico. Such activities are subject to various laws, rules and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including, in some cases, posting of reclamation bonds. All phases of Kimbers operations are subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner requiring stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed properties and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors, employees and contractors. Also, environmental regulations may change in the future which could adversely affect Kimbers operations including the potential to curtail or cease exploration programs or to preclude entirely the economic development of a mineral property. The extent of any future changes to environmental regulations cannot be predicted or quantified, but it should be assumed that such regulations would become more stringent in the future. Generally, new regulations will result in increased compliance costs, including costs for obtaining permits, delays or fines resulting from loss of permits or failure to comply with the new regulations. RISKS FOR U.S. HOLDERS U.S. investors may not be able to enforce their civil liabilities against Kimber or its directors and officers. It may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against Kimber which is incorporated in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. With the exception of two (2) directors who are residents of the U.S., the officers and directors of Kimber are residents of British Columbia, Ontario and Ecuador having all or a substantial portion of their assets located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for U.S. shareholders of Kimber to effect service of process on these persons within the U.S. or to enforce judgements obtained in the U.S. based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against Kimber or its officers and directors. In addition, U.S. shareholders of Kimber should not assume that the courts of Canada (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against Kimber, its officers or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal sec urities laws or other laws of the U.S., or (ii) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against Kimber, its officers or directors predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the U.S. The Company could be deemed a Passive Foreign Investment Company which could have negative consequences for U.S. investors. 24 Potential investors who are U.S. taxpayers should be aware that Kimber may be a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for the current fiscal year, and may also have been a PFIC in prior years and may also be a PFIC in subsequent years. If Kimber is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. taxpayers holding period, then such U.S. taxpayer generally will be required to treat any so-called excess distribution received on its common shares, or any gain realized upon a disposition of common shares, as ordinary income and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such distribution or gain, unless the taxpayer makes a valid qualified electing fund (QEF) election or a mark-to-market election with respect to the shares of Kimber. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exceed the amount of the excess distribution received, or the amount of proceeds of disposition realized, by the taxpayer. A U.S. taxpayer who makes a QEF election generally must report on a current basis its share of Kimbers net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which Kimber is a PFIC, whether or not Kimber distributes any amounts to its shareholders. A QEF election will only be effective if Kimber provides certain information to the U.S. holders. There can be no assurances Kimber can, or will comply with these requirements. A U.S. taxpayer who makes the mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the common shares over the taxpayers tax basis therein. If Kimber is (or has been) a PFIC and at any time has a non-US corporate subsidiary that is a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally would be deemed to own, and also would be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to, their indirect ownership interests in any such lower-tier PFIC. A mark-to-market election under the PFIC rules with respect to Kimber would not apply to a lower-tier PFIC, and a U.S. Holder would not be able to make such an election with respect to its indirect ownership interest in any lower-tier PFIC.
