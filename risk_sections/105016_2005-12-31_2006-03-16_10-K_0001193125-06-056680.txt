ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Business Risk Factors Supplier Concentration We maintain distribution agreements with the key equipment suppliers, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, for terms generally ranging from one to ten years. Certain of the distribution agreements contain provisions that restrict or limit the sale of competitive products in the markets served. Other than the markets where such restrictions and limitations may apply, we may distribute other manufacturers lines of air conditioning or heating equipment. Purchases from these suppliers comprised 48% of all purchases made in 2005 with the largest supplier accounting for 17% of all purchases made in 2005. Any significant interruption by the manufacturers or a termination of a distribution agreement could temporarily disrupt the operations of certain subsidiaries. Future results of operations are also materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance of these manufacturers products and their ability to continue to manufacture products that comply with laws relating to environmental and efficiency standards. Competition We operate in highly competitive environments. We compete with a number of distributors and also with several air conditioning and heating equipment manufacturers that distribute a significant portion of their products through their own distribution organizations in certain markets. Competition within any given geographic market is based upon product availability, customer service, price and quality. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause our products or services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion, all of which would have a material adverse effect on profitability. Seasonality Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment and parts and supplies have historically been seasonal. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on the severity or mildness of weather patterns during summer or winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is highest in the second and third quarters with demand for heating equipment usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets is fairly even during the year except for dependence on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions. Temporary Staffing Services The Staffing segment (representing 1% of revenues in 2005) derives 92% of its revenues from temporary staffing services, which are sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity. Significant declines in demand for temporary staffing services would negatively impact the Staffing segments operating results and could impact underlying asset carrying values. General Risk Factors Risks Related to Insurance Coverage We carry general liability, comprehensive property damage, workers compensation and other insurance coverages that management considers adequate for the protection of its assets and operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the coverage limits of 7 Table of Contents such policies will be adequate to cover losses and expenses for lawsuits brought or which may be brought against us. A loss in excess of insurance coverages could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and/or profitability. Certain self-insurance risks for health benefits and casualty insurance programs are retained and reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Assurance cannot be provided that actual claims will not exceed present estimates. Exposure to catastrophic losses has been limited by maintaining excess and aggregate liability coverages and implementing loss control programs. Goodwill and Intangibles At December 31, 2005, goodwill and intangibles represented approximately 24% of total assets. Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are no longer amortized and are subject to impairment testing at least annually using a fair value based approach. The identification and measurement of impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. Accounting for impairment contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles may not be recoverable. The operating results of the Staffing segment have been negatively impacted by lower demand for services during the past five years. Significant cost-savings measures have been executed in response to the business environment. Should the Staffing segments operating results materially deteriorate, an impairment charge may be necessary to the extent that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. Although no impairment has been recorded to date, there can be no assurances that future impairments will not occur. Control by Existing Shareholder As of December 31, 2005, Albert H. Nahmad, Watscos Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a limited partnership controlled by him, collectively had beneficial ownership of approximately 57% of the combined voting power of the outstanding Common stock and Class B common stock. Based on Mr. Nahmads stock ownership and the stock ownership of the limited partnership controlled by him, Mr. Nahmad has the voting power to elect all but three members of the nine-person Board of Directors and to control most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.
