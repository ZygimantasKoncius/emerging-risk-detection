ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically. Historically, natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Natural gas price have declined from approximately $13 per Mmbtu in July 2008 to approximately $4.50 per Mmbtu as of February 1, 2009. Oil prices have declined from record levels in July 2008 of approximately $145 per barrel to approximately $40 per barrel as of February 1, 2009. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a particularly large impact on our financial results. Prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:  the level of consumer product demand;  weather conditions;  political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions, including the Middle East;  the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the price of foreign imports;  actions of governmental authorities;  pipeline availability and capacity constraints;  inventory storage levels;  domestic and foreign governmental regulations;  the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels; and  overall economic conditions. These factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil. If natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures, raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations. Drilling natural gas and oil wells is a high-risk activity. Our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. Drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:  unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations;  equipment failures or accidents;  adverse weather conditions;  compliance with governmental requirements; and  shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment. Our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline. We may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame, or at all. We may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because, in some cases, we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location. Similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:  the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of the seismic data;  the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects;  the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled;  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;  our financial resources and results; and  the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects. These projects may not be successfully developed and the wells, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as natural gas and oil prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general. Our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable. In general, the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. Our future natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. We may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration, development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs. Low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically. Lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures. Our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed producing reserves as of December 31, 2008 will decline at estimated rates of 21%, 17%, 12% and 11% during 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline. Because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves, we consider this pattern fairly typical. Exploration, development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes, the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves. Acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities. Successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include exploration potential, future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs, and potential 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. Often, we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. The integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult, and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations. The integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult, and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations. These difficulties include:  the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business; and  the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations. The process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. We face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses. Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including:  well site blowouts, cratering and explosions;  equipment failures;  uncontrolled flows of natural gas, oil or well fluids;  fires;  formations with abnormal pressures;  pollution and other environmental risks; and  natural disasters. In addition, we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas (largely coastal waters), which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage from severe weather. Any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life, loss of hydrocarbons, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution, regulatory investigations and penalties, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. Our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. As of December 31, 2008, we owned or operated approximately 3,500 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems. As part of our normal maintenance program, we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair, replacement or additional maintenance. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. We do not carry business interruption insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. Non-operated wells represented approximately 15% of our total owned gross wells, or approximately 4.8% of our owned net wells, as of December 31, 2008. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs. Terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business. The threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations. Future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the United States. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing. The sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. Competition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense. Major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties, as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. Our competitive position is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record. Many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. These companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil. From time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions. While there are many different types of derivatives available, in 2008 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collar and swap agreements covering portions of our 2008 production and anticipated 2009 and 2010 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively. The collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. They provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. The price swaps call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. In addition, these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances, including when:  a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations;  production is less than expected; or  there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. Please read Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. In addition, our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers and other professionals. Competition for experienced geologists, engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed. We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations could subject us to fines, injunctions or both. These laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease. Risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations. It is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production, would result in substantial costs and liabilities. 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Provisions of Delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment. Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors with staggered terms, and our charter authorizes our Board of Directors to set the terms of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. Our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders. We also have adopted a stockholder rights plan. Because of our stockholder rights plan and these provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. As a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent Board of Directors. The personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the Delaware General Corporation Law and by our certificate of incorporation. The Delaware General Corporation Law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. Our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:  for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders;  for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;  under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and  for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. This limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders. The global financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict. The continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on our business and our financial condition, and we may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. The economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. Additionally, market conditions could have an impact on our commodity hedging arrangements if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection. Additionally, the current economic situation could lead to further reduced demand for oil and natural gas, or lower prices for oil and natural gas, or both, which could have a negative impact on our revenues. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES See Item 1. Business. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. All known liabilities are accrued based on managements best estimate of the potential loss. While the outcome and impact of such legal proceedings on us cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow. Operating results, however, could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved. Commitment and Contingency Reserves When deemed necessary, we establish reserves for certain legal proceedings. The establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. While management believes these reserves to be adequate, it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately $2.1 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established. Future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow. Operating results, however, could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved. ITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol COG. The following table presents the high and low closing sales prices per share of our common stock during certain periods, as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system. Cash dividends paid per share of the common stock are also shown. A regular dividend has been declared each quarter since we became a public company in 1990. On February 23, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 split of our common stock in the form of a stock distribution. The stock dividend was distributed on March 30, 2007 to stockholders of record on March 16, 2007. All common stock accounts and per share data, including cash dividends per share, have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 2-for-1 split of our common stock. After the stock split, the dividend was increased to $0.03 per share per quarter, or a 50% increase from pre-split levels. High Low Dividends 2008 First Quarter $ 53.41 $ 37.67 $ 0.03 Second Quarter $ 71.11 $ 51.48 $ 0.03 Third Quarter $ 68.58 $ 33.58 $ 0.03 Fourth Quarter $ 33.83 $ 21.31 $ 0.03 2007 First Quarter $ 35.29 $ 28.06 $ 0.02 Second Quarter $ 41.88 $ 34.55 $ 0.03 Third Quarter $ 38.39 $ 31.55 $ 0.03 Fourth Quarter $ 40.90 $ 33.59 $ 0.03 As of January 31, 2009, there were 544 registered holders of the common stock. Shareholders include individuals, brokers, nominees, custodians, trustees, and institutions such as banks, insurance companies and pension funds. Many of these hold large blocks of stock on behalf of other individuals or firms. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which we may purchase shares of common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the authorization. During 2008, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. All purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions. The maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan as of December 31, 2008 was 4,795,300. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares our common stock performance (COG) with the performance of the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones US Exploration & Production Index for the period December 2003 through December 2008.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Statements in this discussion may be forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward-Looking Information for further details. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation and exploration, exclusively within the United States and Canada. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OVERVIEW Cabot Oil & Gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration, production and marketing of natural gas, and to a lesser extent, crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in North America. We also transport, store, gather and produce natural gas for resale. Our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. Our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced, with a focus on achieving strong financial returns. At Cabot, there are three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital: drilling opportunities, financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate-of-return approach. Our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time. At any one time, one or more of these may not be economically feasible. Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years. Throughout 2007 and most of 2008, the futures market reported strong natural gas and crude oil contract prices. During the fourth quarter of 2008, commodity prices experienced a sharp decline. Our realized natural gas and crude oil price was $8.39 per Mcf and $89.11 per Bbl, respectively, in 2008. These realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments. In an effort to manage commodity price risk, we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars. These financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy and assisted in the increase in our realized natural gas price from 2007 to 2008. Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. See Risk FactorsNatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and Risk FactorsOur future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in Item 1A.

Natural gas revenues increased from 2007 to 2008 as a result of favorable natural gas hedge settlements, increased commodity market prices and increased natural gas production. Crude oil revenues increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to increased realized prices, partially offset by a reduction in crude oil production. Prices, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, increased by 16% for natural gas and 33% for oil. We drilled 432 gross wells with a success rate of 97% in 2008 compared to 461 gross wells with a success rate of 96% in 2007. Total capital and exploration expenditures increased by $844.8 million to $1,481.0 million (including the east Texas acquisition) in 2008 compared to $636.2 million in 2007. We believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2009 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately $475 million. Any additional needs will be funded by borrowings from our credit facility. We have reduced, and may continue to reduce, our budgeted capital and exploration spending to maintain sufficient liquidity. Our 2009 strategy will remain consistent with 2008. We will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position. Additionally, we intend to manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity, and we intend to maintain spending discipline. In the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the East and Gulf Coast regions. We believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and that this activity will continue to add shareholder value over the long-term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward-looking information. Please read Forward-Looking Information for further details. FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary sources of cash in 2008 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production, the private placements of debt completed in July and December 2008, the sale of common stock and, to a lesser extent, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and asset sales. Cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings, the sale of common stock and proceeds from asset sales were primarily used to fund our development (including acquisitions) and, to a lesser extent, exploratory expenditures, in addition to paying dividends and debt issuance costs. See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile, including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years. Commodity prices have recently experienced increased volatility due to adverse market conditions in our economy. In addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. See Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales. Our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above. From time to time, our working capital will reflect a surplus, while at other times it will reflect a deficit. This fluctuation is not unusual. The recent financial and credit crisis has reduced credit availability and liquidity for some companies; however, we believe we have adequate liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $ 634,447 $ 462,137 $ 357,104 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities (1,452,289 ) (589,922 ) (187,353 ) Cash Flows Provided by / (Used in) Financing Activities 827,445 104,429 (138,523 ) Net Increase / (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 9,603 $ (23,356 ) $ 31,228 Operating Activities. Key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased by $172.3 million over 2007. This increase was mainly due to an increase in net income, the receipt of cash of $20.2 million in 2008 in connection with the settlement of a dispute and an increase of $13.7 million in cash received for income tax refunds. In addition, cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of other working capital changes. Average realized natural gas prices increased by 16% in 2008 over 2007 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 33% over the same period. Equivalent production volumes increased by 11% in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of higher natural gas production. We are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. Realized prices may be lower in 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 increased by $105.0 million over 2006. This increase was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for current income taxes from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the 2006 payment of approximately $102 million related to the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale, as well as our 2007 tax net operating loss position and the receipt in 2007 of $29.6 million in federal tax refunds relating to our 2006 tax return. Average realized natural gas prices increased by one percent in 2007 over 2006 and average realized crude oil prices increased by three percent over the same period. Equivalent production decreased by three percent in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of a decrease in crude oil production, offset in part by an increase in natural gas production. See Results of Operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue. Investing Activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending (including the east Texas acquisition and new leases in both Pennsylvania and east Texas) and exploration expenses. We established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices. Due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise, our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by $862.4 million from 2007 to 2008 and increased by $402.6 million from 2006 to 2007. The increase from 2007 to 2008 was due 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to an increase of $866.0 million in capital expenditures, including an increase of approximately $601.8 million primarily due to the $604.0 million east Texas acquisition and an increase of $130.5 million related to unproved leasehold acquisitions primarily in northeast Pennsylvania. In addition, there were $5.0 million of lower proceeds from the sale of assets in 2008 compared to 2007. Partially offsetting these increases to cash used in investing activities were decreased exploration expenditures of $8.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities from 2006 to 2007 was due to a decrease of $322.4 million in 2007 in proceeds from the sale of assets and an increase of $89.8 million in 2007 in capital expenditures, partially offset by reduced exploration expenses of $9.6 million. Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $723.0 million from 2007 to 2008. This was primarily due to an increase in debt consisting of our July 2008 and December 2008 private placements of debt ($492 million) and an increase of $45 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, net proceeds from the sale of common stock increased by $311.1 million primarily due to the June 2008 issuance of common stock. The tax benefit for stock-based compensation increased by $10.7 million from 2007 to 2008, but was partially offset by an increase in dividends and capitalized debt issuance costs paid. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $243.0 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to a $210.0 million increase in debt, principally related to higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, $46.5 million of treasury stock was purchased in 2006 compared with none in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases in cash provided by financing activities were a $9.5 million reduction in the tax benefit for stock-based compensation, lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options and higher dividend payments. At December 31, 2008, we had $185 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.7%. In December 2008, the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the commitment period for lenders holding approximately 90% of the aggregate commitments from December 2009 to October 2010. The December amendment added an accordion feature to allow us, if the existing banks or new banks agree, to increase the available credit line from $350 million to $450 million. The available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks petroleum engineer) and other assets. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. Our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. Management believes that we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our liquidity. At the same time, we will closely monitor the capital markets. As a result of market conditions and our increased level of borrowings, we may experience increased costs associated with future debt. In July 2008, we completed a private placement of $425 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed-rate notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.51%, consisting of amounts due in July 2018, 2020 and 2023. In December 2008, we completed a private placement of $67 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 9.78% fixed-rate notes due in December 2018. Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. In June 2008, we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 5,002,500 shares of common stock at a price to us of $62.66 per share. This aggregate share amount included 652,500 shares of common stock that were issued as a result of the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares. We received $313.5 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. These net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east Texas acquisition, which closed in the third quarter of 2008. Immediately prior to (and in connection with) this issuance, we retired 5,002,500 shares of treasury stock, which had a weighted-average purchase price of $16.46. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Capitalization Information about our capitalization is as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Debt(1) $ 867.0 $ 350.0 Stockholders Equity 1,790.6 1,070.3 Total Capitalization $ 2,657.6 $ 1,420.3 Debt to Capitalization 33 % 25 % Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 28.1 $ 18.5 (1) Includes $35.9 million and $20.0 million of current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Includes $185 million and $140 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends of $12.1 million on our common stock. A regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990. After the March 2007 2-for-1 stock split, the dividend was increased to $0.03 per share per quarter, or a 50% increase from pre-split levels. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, our revolving credit facility. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2008. 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities(1) $ 624.3 $ 539.7 $ 405.5 Leasehold Acquisitions 152.7 22.2 42.6 Acquisitions 625.0 4.0 6.7 Pipeline and Gathering 36.9 28.2 24.2 Other 10.9 2.3 9.1 1,449.8 596.4 488.1 Exploration Expense 31.2 39.8 49.4 Total $ 1,481.0 $ 636.2 $ 537.5 (1) Includes Canadian currency translation effects of $(27.7) million, $15.0 million and $(1.4) million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We plan to drill approximately 148 gross wells (122.3 net) in 2009 compared with 432 gross wells (355 net) drilled in 2008. The number of wells we plan to drill in 2009 is down from 2008 in each of our operating regions due to the underlying economic fundamentals, which have significantly reduced commodity prices. This 2009 drilling program includes approximately $475 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, down from $1,481 million in 2008. We will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements There are many factors that impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rate. These include reserve additions and revisions, development costs, impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods. In 2009, management expects an increase in our DD&A rate due to higher capital costs, partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years. This change is currently estimated to be approximately 13% greater than 2008 levels. This increase will not have an impact on our cash flows. Contractual Obligations Our known material contractual obligations include long-term debt, interest on long-term debt, firm gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases. We have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 are set forth in the following table: Total Payments Due by Year 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 &Beyond (In thousands) Long-Term Debt(1) $ 867,000 $ 35,857 $ 244,143 $ 75,000 $ 512,000 Interest on Long-Term Debt(2) 460,624 63,124 99,602 82,469 215,429 Firm Gas Transportation Agreements(3) 94,670 13,218 23,935 13,374 44,143 Drilling Rig Commitments(3) 44,271 42,021 2,250   Operating Leases(3) 28,686 6,335 9,028 7,397 5,926 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 1,495,251 $ 160,555 $ 378,958 $ 178,240 $ 777,498 (1) Including current portion. At December 31, 2008, we had $185 million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of long-term debt. (2) Interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our $682 million long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2008. Interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the December 31, 2008 long-term outstanding balance of $169.1 million will be outstanding through the October 2010 maturity date and that the short-term outstanding balance of $15.9 million will be outstanding through December 2009. A constant interest rate of 4.8% was assumed, which was the 2008 weighted-average interest rate. Actual results will likely differ from these estimates and assumptions. (3) For further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2008 was $28.0 million, up from $24.7 million at December 31, 2007, primarily due to $1.2 million of accretion expense during 2008 as well as $2.2 million of drilling additions. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The most significant policies are discussed below. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Since 1990, 100% of our reserves have been reviewed by Miller & Lents, Ltd., an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. We have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years. For more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information. Our rate of recording DD&A expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit-of-production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it non-economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. A five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the Company would decrease or increase the DD&A rate by approximately $0.09 to $0.10 per Mcfe. Revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. It is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would have a $0.05 to $0.06 impact on our total DD&A rate. These estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our DD&A rate. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future. Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties We evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease-by-lease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount factor used (13% at December 31, 2008) is based on managements belief that this rate is commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test. In the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline, there could be a significant revision in the future. Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above; however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. Historically, the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed. During the last six months of 2008, commodity prices declined at a significant rate as the global economy struggled with a worldwide recession. This price environment has resulted in reduced capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. We have considered these impacts discussed above when assessing the impairment of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. If the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $13.3 million or decrease by approximately $10.7 million, respectively per year. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the past, the average leasehold life in the Gulf Coast region has been shorter than the average life in the East and West regions. Average property lives in the East, Gulf Coast and West regions have been five, four and seven years, respectively. Average property lives in Canada are estimated to be five years. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We follow the accounting prescribed in SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective. Under SFAS No. 133, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, and 100% effective, if the underlying gas were sold at the Henry Hub index. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges, and the change in fair value of all other derivatives, is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate Revenue, as appropriate in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Fair Value Measurements Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted those provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, that were required to be adopted. This adoption did not have a material impact on any of our financial statements. As defined in SFAS No. 157, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. We attempt to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. SFAS No. 157 establishes a formal fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements, and accordingly, level 1 measurements should be used whenever possible. As of December 31, 2008, we had $355.2 million of assets, or 10% of our total assets, classified as Level 3. This was entirely comprised of our derivative receivable balance from our oil and gas cash flow hedges. During 2008, realized gains of $347.9 million were recognized in other comprehensive income. Derivative settlements during the year totaled $13.0 million. The fair values of our natural gas and crude oil price collars and swaps are valued based upon quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements and are designated as Level 3. Such quotes have been derived using a Black-Scholes model for the active oil and gas commodities market that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a LIBOR curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term. Although we utilize multiple quotes to assess the reasonableness of our values, we have not attempted to obtain sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these derivative contracts as Level 2. We adjust the fair value quotes received by our counterparties to take into account either the counterparties nonperformance risk or our own nonperformance 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements risk. We measured the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions and made a reduction to our derivative receivable. In times where we have net derivative contract liabilities, our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank. Additional disclosures are required for transactions measured at fair value and we have included these disclosures in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Term Employee Benefit Costs Our costs of long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. The current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. The discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. Our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of high-quality fixed income securities. In order to select the discount rate, we use benchmarks such as the Moodys Aa Corporate Rate, which was 5.54% as of December 31, 2008, and the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, which was 5.87% as of December 31, 2008. We look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments. We have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 5.75% at December 31, 2008 is reasonable. In order to value our pension liabilities, we use the RP-2000 Combined Mortality Table based on the demographics of our benefit plans. We have also assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases. The benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2008, the assumed rate of increase was 9.0%. The net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate, and reflects long-term expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions. The actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Managements goal is to manage the investments over the long-term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility. We have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan. We attempt to maximize return over the long-term, subject to appropriate levels of risk. One of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the Standard and Poors 500 Index over the long-term. We also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return (above the rate of inflation) on the total portfolio over the long-term. We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking long-term expected rate of return assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. In our pension calculations, we have used eight percent as the expected long-term return on plan assets for 2008, 2007 and 2006. A Monte Carlo simulation was run using 5,000 simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration, which has been determined to be approximately 15 years. This model uses historical data for the period of 1926-2007 for stocks, bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns. The median rate of return, or return that we expect to achieve over 50 percent of the time, is approximately nine percent. We expect to achieve at a minimum approximately 7% annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long-term at least 75 percent of the time. We believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately 50% to 80% for equity securities and approximately 20% to 40% for fixed income securities. Large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of 65% of the portfolio. Small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of 30% and 15%, respectively, of the portfolio. Fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of 40% of our portfolio. The account will typically be fully invested; however, as a temporary investment or an asset protection measure, part of the account may be invested in money market investments up to 20%. One percent of the portfolio is invested in short-term funds at the designated bank to meet the cash flow needs of the plan. No prohibited investments, including direct or indirect investments in commodities, commodity futures, derivatives, short sales, real estate investment trusts, letter stock, restricted stock or other private placements, are allowed without prior committee approval. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting for stock options and similar equity instruments. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black-Scholes valuation model may be used. Stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in General and Administrative Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date. The grant date fair value is calculated by using a Black-Scholes model that incorporations assumptions for stock price volatility, risk free rate of return, expected dividend and expected term. The expected term was derived by reviewing minimum and maximum expected term outputs from the Black-Scholes model based on award type and employee type. This term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding. The stock price volatility was calculated using our historical closing stock price data for the period associated with the expected term through the grant date of each award. The risk free rate of return percentages are based on the continuously compounded equivalent of the US Treasury (Nominal 10) within the expected term as measured on the grant date. The expected dividend percentage assumes that we will continue to pay a consistent level of dividend each quarter. Expense is recorded based on a graded-vesting schedule over a three year service period, with one-third of the award becoming exercisable each year on the anniversary date of the grant. The forfeiture rate is determined based on the forfeiture history by type of award and by the group of individuals receiving the award. The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and certain performance share awards (which contain vesting restrictions based either on operating income or internal performance metrics) are measured based on the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date. Restricted stock awards primarily vest either at the end of a three year service period, or on a graded-vesting basis of one-third at each anniversary date over a three year service period. The annual forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards ranges from 0% to 7.2% based on approximately ten years of our history for this type of award to various employee groups. Performance shares that vest based on operating income vest on a graded-vesting basis of one-third at each anniversary date over a three year service period and no forfeiture rate is assumed. Performance shares that vest based on internal metrics vest at the end of a three year performance period and an annual forfeiture rate of 4.5% is assumed. Expense for restricted stock units is recorded immediately as these awards vest immediately. Restricted stock units are granted only to our directors and no forfeiture rate is assumed. We grant another type of performance share award to executive employees that vest at the end of a three year performance period based on the comparative performance of our stock measured against sixteen other companies in our peer group. Depending on our performance, up to 100% of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in stock plus an additional 100% of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in cash. These awards are accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components. A Monte 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Carlo model is used to value the liability component as well as the equity portion of the certain awards on the date of grant. The four primary inputs for the Monte Carlo model are the risk-free rate, volatility of returns, correlation in movement of total shareholder return and the expected dividend. The risk-free rate was generated from the Federal Reserve website for constant maturity treasuries for one and two year bonds and is set equal to the yield, for the period over the remaining duration of the performance period, on treasury securities as of the reporting date. Volatility was set equal to the annualized daily volatility measured over a historic one and two year period ending on the reporting date. Correlation in movement of total shareholder return was determined based on a correlation matrix that was created which identifies total shareholder return correlations for each pair of companies in the peer group, including us. The paired returns in the correlation matrix ranged from approximately 71% to approximately 89% for us and our peer group. The expected dividend is calculated using our dividends paid ($0.12 for 2008) divided by the December 31, 2008 closing price of our stock ($26.00). Based on these inputs discussed above, a ranking was projected identifying our rank relative to the peer group. No forfeiture rate is assumed for this type of award. Expense related to these awards can be volatile based on our comparative ranking at the end of each quarter. We used the shortcut approach to derive our initial windfall tax benefit pool. We chose to use a one-pool approach which combines all awards granted to employees, including non-employee directors. On January 16, 2008, our Board of Directors adopted a Supplemental Employee Incentive Plan. The plan was intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for full-time non-officer employees by providing for cash payments in the event our common stock reached specified trading prices. The bonus payout of a minimum of 50% of an employees base salary was triggered if, for any 20 trading days (which need not be consecutive) that fell within a period of 60 consecutive trading days occurring on or before November 1, 2011, the closing price per share of our common stock equaled or exceeded the final price goal of $60 per share. The plan also provided that an interim distribution of 10% of an employees base salary would be paid to eligible employees upon achieving the interim price goal of $50 per share prior to December 31, 2009. On the January 16, 2008 adoption date of the plan, our closing stock price was $40.71. On April 8, 2008 and subsequently on June 2, 2008, we achieved the interim and final target goals and total distributions of $15.7 million were paid in 2009. No further distributions will be made under this plan. On July 24, 2008, our Board of Directors adopted a second Supplemental Employee Incentive Plan (Plan II). Plan II is similar to the January 2008 Supplemental Incentive Plan; however, the final target is that the closing price per share of our common stock must equal or exceed the price goal of $105 per share on or before June 20, 2012. Under Plan II, each eligible employee may receive (upon approval by the Compensation Committee) a distribution of 50% of his or her base salary (or 30% of base salary if we paid interim distributions upon the achievement of the interim price goal discussed below). Plan II provides that a distribution of 20% of an eligible employees base salary upon achieving the interim price goal of $85 per share on or before June 30, 2010. The Compensation Committee can increase the 50% or 20% payment as it applies to any employee. Payments under this plan will partially be paid within 15 business days after achieving the target and the remaining portion will be paid based on a separate payment date as described in Plan II. These awards under both plans discussed above have been accounted for as liability awards under SFAS No. 123(R), and the total expense for 2008 was $15.9 million. For further information regarding the supplemental employee incentive plans and our other stock-based compensation awards, please refer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production, Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Transportation, Federal Regulation of Petroleum and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. Our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.5 to 1.0. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity. Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage. Our business involves a variety of operating risks. See Risk FactorsWe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in Item 1A. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. During the past few years, we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the East. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2008, the SEC issued Release No. 33-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, which amends the oil and gas disclosures for oil and gas producers contained in Regulations S-K and S-X, as well as adding a section to Regulation S-K (Subpart 1200) to codify the revised disclosure requirements in Securities Act Industry Guide 2, which is being phased out. The goal of Release No. 33-8995 is to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves. Energy companies affected by Release No. 33-8995 will be required to price proved oil and gas reserves using the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. SEC Release No. 33-8995 is effective beginning January 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating what impact Release No. 33-8995 may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. Under this FSP, unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether they are paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. In addition, all prior period earnings per share data presented should be adjusted retrospectively and early application is not permitted. We do not believe that FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which identifies a consistent framework for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements for nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The current GAAP hierarchy was criticized due to its complexity, ranking position of FASB Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts and the fact that it is directed at auditors rather than entities. SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The FASB does not expect that SFAS No. 162 will have a change in current practice, and we do not believe that SFAS No. 162 will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Enhanced disclosures to improve financial reporting transparency are required and include disclosure about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in the financial statements, how derivative instruments are accounted for and how derivatives affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. A tabular format including the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses, disclosure about credit risk-related derivative features and cross-referencing within the footnotes are also new requirements. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application and comparative disclosures encouraged, but not required. We have not yet adopted SFAS No. 161. We do not believe that there will be an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) was issued in an effort to continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures. It changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. Certain of these changes will introduce more volatility into earnings. The acquirer must now record all assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value, and related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than the previous method of being capitalized as part of the acquisition. SFAS No. 141(R) also impacts the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions, including those that close before the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R). The definitions of a business and a business combination have been expanded, resulting in more transactions qualifying as business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 31, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. We cannot predict the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows with respect to any acquisitions completed after December 31, 2008. Forward-Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward-looking statements. The words expect, project, estimate, believe, anticipate, intend, budget, plan, 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements forecast, predict, may, should, could, will and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, market factors, market prices (including regional basis differentials) of natural gas and oil, results for future drilling and marketing activity, future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information about these risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2008 and 2007 Compared We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $211.3 million, or $2.10 per share. During 2007, we reported net income of $167.4 million, or $1.73 per share. This increase of $43.9 million in net income was primarily due to an increase in operating revenues and gains on asset sales and settlements, partially offset by increased operating, interest and income tax expenses. Operating revenues increased by $213.6 million, largely due to increases in both natural gas production revenues and brokered natural gas revenues and crude oil and condensate revenues. Operating expenses increased by $155.9 million between periods due to increases in all categories of operating expenses other than exploration expense. In addition, net income was impacted by an increase in gain on sale of assets and gain on settlement of dispute of $39.6 million as well as an increase in expenses of $53.4 million resulting from a combination of increased income tax expense and interest and other expenses. Income tax expense was higher in 2008 as a result of higher income before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007, in addition to an increase in the effective tax rate. Natural Gas Production Revenues Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $8.39 per Mcf for 2008 compared to $7.23 per Mcf for 2007. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $0.20 per Mcf in 2008 and by $0.99 per Mcf in 2007. There was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Natural gas production in the Gulf Coast region increased due to increased production in the Minden field, largely due to the properties we acquired in east Texas in August 2008, as well as increased drilling in the County Line field. In addition, natural gas production increased in the West region associated with an increase in the drilling program, increased in the East region as a result of increased drilling activity in West Virginia and northeastern Pennsylvania. Canada increased due to drilling in the Hinton field.

These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which decreased the price by $6.33 per Bbl in 2008 and by $0.97 per Bbl in 2007.

The decrease in oil production is mainly the result of a natural decline in crude oil production in the Gulf Coast and West regions. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized (In thousands) Operating Revenues - Increase/(Decrease) to Revenue Cash Flow Hedges Natural Gas Production $ 17,972 $  $ 79,838 $  Crude Oil (4,951 )  (796 )  Total Cash Flow Hedges $ 13,021 $  $ 79,042 $  We are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas price agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non-performance by third parties are substantially smaller. We do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non-performance by third parties. Our primary derivative contract counterparties are JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of Montreal. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations increased by $155.9 million in 2008 from 2007. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $41.5 million from 2007 to 2008. This is primarily due to the impact on the DD&A rate of higher capital costs and higher natural gas production volumes, including the east Texas acquisition.  Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties and Other Assets increased by $31.1 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily related to impairments of approximately $28.3 million in the Trawick field in Rusk County, Texas in the Gulf Coast region resulting from a decline in natural gas prices and higher well costs as well as $3.0 million in the Corral Creek field in Washakie County, Wyoming in the West region resulting from lower than expected performance from the two well field.  General and Administrative expenses increased by $23.4 million from 2007 to 2008. This is primarily due to increased stock compensation expense related to the payouts of our supplemental employee incentive plan bonuses ($15.7 million) as well as increased expense related to our performance share awards ($5.1 million).  Impairment of Unproved Properties increased by $22.5 million from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to increased lease acquisition costs in several exploratory and developmental areas, as well as a $17.0 million charge for the impairment of three exploratory oil and gas prospects located in Mississippi, Montana and North Dakota. These prospects were impaired as a result of the significant decline in commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 and abandonment of our exploration plans.  Brokered Natural Gas Cost increased by $18.6 million from 2007 to 2008. See the preceding table titled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis.  Direct Operations expenses increased by $14.6 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to higher personnel and labor expenses, maintenance expenses, treating, compressor, pipeline and workover costs and vehicle and fuel expenses, partially offset by lower insurance costs. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Taxes Other Than Income increased by $12.8 million from 2007 to 2008 due to higher production taxes as a result of higher operating revenues and, to a lesser extent, higher ad valorem taxes, partially offset by lower franchise taxes.  Exploration expense decreased by $8.6 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to fewer dry holes, partially offset by increased geological and geophysical costs. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased by $19.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the debt we issued in our July and December 2008 private placements and, to a lesser extent, higher average credit facility borrowings, offset in part by a lower weighted-average interest rate on our revolving credit facility borrowings and lower outstanding borrowings on our 7.19% fixed rate debt. Weighted-average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately $172 million during 2008 compared to approximately $52 million during 2007. The weighted-average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to 4.8% during 2008 from 7.2% during 2007. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $34.2 million due to a comparable increase in our pre-tax income. The effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 37.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a one time benefit for state taxes in 2007 of approximately $2.8 million attributable to favorable treatment of the gain from the sale of south Louisiana properties in 2006 and a reduction in special deductions in 2008. 2007 and 2006 Compared We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $167.4 million, or $1.73 per share. During 2006, we reported net income of $321.2 million, or $3.32 per share. This decrease of $153.8 million in net income was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of $254.2 million resulting from the gain on sale of assets of $231.2 million included in 2006 related to the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale, partially offset by a $99.2 million decrease in income tax expense and a $1.2 million decrease in interest and other expenses in 2007. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of a decrease in 2007 of $218.6 million in gain on sale of assets primarily from the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale. Additionally, there was a $29.8 million decrease in 2007 in operating revenues and an increase of $5.8 million in operating expenses. The decrease in operating revenues was largely the result of lower oil production in the Gulf Coast region primarily as a result of the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased DD&A and impairment expenses, offset in part by reduced exploration and general and administrative expenses. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural Gas Production Revenues Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $7.23 per Mcf for 2007 compared to $7.13 per Mcf for 2006. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $0.99 per Mcf in 2007 and $0.35 per Mcf in 2006. There was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006.

After removing from the 2006 results $70.5 million of natural gas revenues and 9,037 Mmcf of natural gas production associated with properties in the Gulf Coast region sold in the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale, total natural gas revenue would have increased by $84.0 million, or 17%, and natural gas production would have increased by 9,791 Mmcf, or 14%, from 2006 to 2007. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount Percent Sales Price ($/Mcf) $ 8.40 $ 8.14 $ 0.26 3 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 11,101 x 11,502 (401 ) (3 %) Brokered Natural Gas Revenues (In thousands) $ 93,215 $ 93,651 Purchase Price ($/Mcf) $ 7.37 $ 7.25 $ 0.12 2 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 11,101 x 11,502 (401 ) (3 %) Brokered Natural Gas Cost (In thousands) $ 81,819 $ 83,375 Brokered Natural Gas Margin (In thousands) $ 11,396 $ 10,276 $ 1,120 11 % (In thousands) Sales Price Variance Impact on Revenue $ 2,828 Volume Variance Impact on Revenue (3,264 ) $ (436 ) (In thousands) Purchase Price Variance Impact on Purchases $ (1,351 ) Volume Variance Impact on Purchases 2,907 $ 1,556 The increased brokered natural gas margin of approximately $1.1 million is driven by an increase in sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase price, partially offset by a decrease in the volumes brokered in 2007 over 2006. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues Our average total company realized crude oil sales price was $67.16 per Bbl for 2007. The 2007 price includes the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which decreased the price by $0.97 per Bbl. Our average total company realized crude oil sales price was $65.03 per Bbl for 2006. There was no realized impact of crude oil derivative instruments in 2006.

The decrease in oil production is mainly the result of the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale in the Gulf Coast region. After removing from the 2006 results $47.4 million of crude oil revenues and 707 Mbbls of crude oil production associated with properties in the Gulf Coast region sold in the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale, total crude oil revenue would have increased by $11.2 million, or 26%, and crude oil production would have increased by 124 Mbbls, or 18%, from 2006 to 2007. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized (In thousands) Operating RevenuesIncrease / (Decrease) to Revenue Cash Flow Hedges Natural Gas Production $ 79,838 $  $ 28,266 $  Crude Oil (796 )    Total Cash Flow Hedges $ 79,042 $  $ 28,266 $  We are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations increased by $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $14.9 million in 2007 over 2006. This is primarily due to the impact on the DD&A rate of negative reserve revisions due to lower prices at the end of 2006, higher capital costs and commencement of production in an east Texas field.  Exploration expense decreased by $9.6 million from 2006 to 2007, primarily as a result of a decrease in total dry hole expense of $10.3 million, primarily in Canada and, to a lesser extent, in the West and Gulf Coast regions. In addition, there was a decrease in geophysical and geological expenses of $1.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in the Gulf Coast region, offset in part by an increase in Canada. Offsetting part of these decreases was an increase of $2.6 million in land and lease search expenses during 2007.  Impairment of Unproved Properties increased by $7.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to increased lease acquisition costs during 2005 and 2006 in several exploratory areas.  General and Administrative expense decreased by $7.4 million in 2007 primarily due to decreased stock compensation charges of $5.9 million due to a reduction in performance share expense from a change in the liability component of the awards resulting from the variance in our relative ranking from 2006 to 2007 as well as a reduction in restricted stock awards as a result of awards that vested in 2007. In addition, there was a decrease of $4.2 million related to decreased professional services fees for litigation. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in employee compensation related expenses and bad debt expense.  Direct Operations expense increased by $2.4 million as a result of higher employee compensation charges and disposal, treating, compressor, workover and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower outside operated properties expense and insurance expense.  Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $1.6 million from 2006 to 2007. See the preceding table labeled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis.  Taxes Other Than Income decreased by $1.5 million for 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to decreased production taxes of $3.3 million as a result of decreased commodity volumes and prices as well as decreased franchise taxes, partially offset by an increase in ad valorem taxes. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties and Other Assets increased by $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, due to an impairment recorded in 2007 in the Gulf Coast region resulting from two non-commercial development completions in a small field in north Louisiana. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased by $1.1 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a lower weighted-average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility, a lower outstanding principal amount of our 7.19% fixed rate debt and lower weighted-average borrowings under our credit facility, as well as increased income related to FIN 48 as discussed below. These decreases to interest expense were offset in part by decreased regulatory capitalized interest on our pipeline in the East region. Weighted-average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately $52 million during 2007 compared to approximately $61 million during 2006. The weighted-average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to 7.2% during 2007 from 7.9% during 2006. In addition, interest expense decreased due to the reversal of interest payable on a previous uncertain tax position. During 2007, we recorded net interest income related to FIN 48 of $1.3 million, with no amount recorded in 2006. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased by $99.2 million due to a comparable decrease in our pre-tax income, primarily as a result of the decrease in the gain on sale of assets. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 35.0% and 37.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in our overall state income tax rate for 2007. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices. Realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable. The debt and equity markets have recently experienced unfavorable conditions, which may affect our ability to access those markets. As a result of the volatility and disruption in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings, we may experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances. At this time, we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent market events. We will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our lenders in our revolving credit facility. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks. At December 31, 2008, we had 26 cash flow hedges open: 14 natural gas price collar arrangements, 10 natural gas price swap arrangements and two crude oil price swap arrangements. At December 31, 2008, a $355.2 million ($223.1 million, net of tax) unrealized gain was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income / (Loss), along with a $264.7 million short-term derivative receivable and a $90.5 million long-term derivative receivable. The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income / (Loss). The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges, and the change in fair value of all other derivatives, are recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate Revenue, as appropriate. For the years ended December 31 2008, 2007 and 2006, there was no ineffectiveness recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the second quarter of 2008, in anticipation of the east Texas acquisition, we entered into 12 contracts for natural gas price swaps and three contracts for crude oil swaps (2009 and 2010 contracts included in the amounts discussed above) for the remainder of 2008 and extending through 2010 for the purpose of reducing commodity price risk associated with anticipated production after the transaction closing. Based upon estimates at December 31, 2008, we would expect to reclassify to the Consolidated Statement of Operations, over the next 12 months, $166.2 million in after-tax income associated with commodity hedges. This reclassification represents the net short-term receivable associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at December 31, 2008 related to anticipated 2009 production. Hedges on ProductionSwaps From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market-based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. During 2008, natural gas price swaps covered 9,821 Mmcf, or 11%, of our 2008 gas production at an average price of $10.27 per Mcf. During 2008, we entered into natural gas price swaps covering a portion of our anticipated 2008, 2009 and 2010 production, including production related to the east Texas acquisition. At December 31, 2008, we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering a portion of our anticipated 2009 and 2010 production as follows: Natural Gas Price Swaps Contract Period VolumeinMmcf Weighted-AverageContract Price(per Mcf) Net UnrealizedGain(In thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2009 16,079 $ 12.18 $ 90,267 Year Ended December 31, 2010 19,295 $ 11.43 $ 70,345 We had one crude oil price swap covering 92 Mbbl, or 12%, of our 2008 production at a price of $127.15 per Bbl. During 2008, we entered into crude oil price swaps covering a portion of our anticipated 2008, 2009 and 2010 production. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements At December 31, 2008, we had open crude oil price swap contracts covering a portion of our anticipated 2009 and 2010 production as follows: Crude Oil Price Swaps Contract Period VolumeinMbbl ContractPrice(per Bbl) Net UnrealizedGain(In thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2009 365 $ 125.25 $ 25,656 Year Ended December 31, 2010 365 $ 125.00 $ 21,840 Hedges on ProductionOptions From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index price falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. During 2008, natural gas price collars covered 54,173 Mmcf, or 60%, of our 2008 gas production, with a weighted-average floor of $8.53 per Mcf and a weighted-average ceiling of $10.70 per Mcf. At December 31, 2008, we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering a portion of our anticipated 2009 production as follows: Natural Gas Price Collars Contract Period VolumeinMmcf Weighted-AverageCeiling / Floor(per Mcf) Net UnrealizedGain(In thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2009 47,253 $ 12.39/$9.40 $ 152,191 During 2008, an oil price collar covered 366 Mbbls, or 47%, of our 2008 crude oil production, with a floor of $60.00 per Bbl and a ceiling of $80.00 per Bbl. We are exposed to market risk on these open contracts, to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil. However, the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged. The amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain columns in the tables above represent our total unrealized gain position at December 31, 2008. Also impacting the total unrealized net gain (reflecting the net receivable position) in accumulated other comprehensive income / (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is a reduction of $5.1 million related to our assessment of our counterparties nonperformance risk. This risk was evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions. The preceding paragraphs contain forward-looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities. See Forward-Looking Information for further details. Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. The fair value of long-term debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt, including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and the year- end market rate. The credit spread is our default or repayment risk. The credit spread (premium or discount) is determined by comparing our fixed-rate notes to new issues (secured and unsecured) and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt. The fair value of all of the fixed-rate notes, excluding the credit facility, are based on interest rates currently available to us. The credit facility approximates fair value because this instrument bears interest at rates based on current market rates. We use available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for and reports fair value measurements in 2008. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in 2006. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Houston, Texas February 27, 2009 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Company also transports, stores, gathers and purchases natural gas for resale. The Company operates in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation and exploration, exclusively within the continental United States and Canada. The Companys exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. The consolidated financial statements contain the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On February 23, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 split of the Companys common stock in the form of a stock distribution. The stock dividend was distributed on March 30, 2007 to stockholders of record on March 16, 2007. All common stock accounts and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 2-for-1 split of the Companys common stock. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Release No. 33-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, which amends the oil and gas disclosures for oil and gas producers contained in Regulations S-K and S-X, as well as adding a section to Regulation S-K (Subpart 1200) to codify the revised disclosure requirements in Securities Act Industry Guide 2, which is being phased out. The goal of Release No. 33-8995 is to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves. Energy companies affected by Release No. 33-8995 will be required to price proved oil and gas reserves using the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. SEC Release No. 33-8995 is effective beginning January 1, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating what impact Release No. 33-8995 may have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. Under this FSP, unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether they are paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. In addition, all prior period earnings per share data presented should be adjusted retrospectively and early application is not permitted. The Company does not believe that FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which identifies a consistent framework for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements for nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The current GAAP hierarchy 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements was criticized due to its complexity, ranking position of FASB Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts and the fact that it is directed at auditors rather than entities. SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The FASB does not expect that SFAS No. 162 will have a change in current practice, and the Company does not believe that SFAS No. 162 will have an impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Enhanced disclosures to improve financial reporting transparency are required and include disclosure about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in the financial statements, how derivative instruments are accounted for and how derivatives affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. A tabular format including the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses, disclosure about credit risk-related derivative features and cross-referencing within the footnotes are also new requirements. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application and comparative disclosures encouraged, but not required. The Company has not yet adopted SFAS No. 161. It does not believe that there will be an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) was issued in an effort to continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures. It changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. Certain of these changes will introduce more volatility into earnings. The acquirer must now record all assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value, and related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than the previous method of being capitalized as part of the acquisition. SFAS No. 141(R) also impacts the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions, including those that close before the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R). The definitions of a business and a business combination have been expanded, resulting in more transactions qualifying as business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 31, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company cannot predict the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows with respect to any acquisitions completed after December 31, 2008. Inventories Inventories are comprised of natural gas in storage, tubular goods and well equipment and pipeline imbalances. All inventory balances are carried at the lower of cost or market. Natural gas in storage is valued at average cost. Tubular goods and well equipment are valued at historical cost. Natural gas gathering and pipeline operations normally include imbalance arrangements with the pipeline. The volumes of natural gas due to or from the Company under imbalance arrangements are recorded at actual selling or purchase prices, as the case may be, and are adjusted monthly to reflect market changes. The net value of the natural gas imbalance is included in inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Properties and Equipment The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs, are expensed. Development costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells, and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves. The determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, and engineering data. If a well is determined to be successful, the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well. If a well is determined to be unsuccessful, the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to expense in the period the determination is made. If an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production can begin, the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found only as long as: i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii) drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future. If drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned, or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves, the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired, and its costs are charged to expense. For a discussion of the Companys suspended wells, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company determines if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of a review of all fields. The impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded total impairments of $31.3 million (excluding the impairment of $4.4 million of goodwill), $4.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Development costs of proved oil and gas properties, including estimated dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs, are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the units-of-production method using proved developed and proved reserves, respectively. The costs of unproved oil and gas properties are generally combined and impaired over a period that is based on the average holding period for such properties and the Companys experience of successful drilling. Properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years. Generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12 to 25 years, gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10 to 16 years. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 25 years. Costs of retired, sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization if the units-of-production rate is not significantly affected. Accordingly, a gain or loss, if any, is recognized only when a group of proved properties (entire field) that make up the amortization base has been retired, abandoned or sold. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the disposition of the Companys offshore portfolio and certain south Louisiana properties to a third party, which was substantially completed in 2006 (the 2006 south Louisiana and offshore properties sale). Revenue Recognition and Gas Imbalances The Company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers. Natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties. Production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances. A natural gas imbalance liability is recorded at the actual price realized upon the gas sale in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet if the Companys excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Companys wellhead gas imbalances. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Brokered Natural Gas Margin The revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses. The Company realizes brokered margin as a result of buying and selling natural gas in back-to-back transactions with separate counterparties. The Company realized $13.8 million, $11.4 million and $10.3 million of brokered natural gas margin in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to turn around. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company is required to make judgments, including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the Company has taken. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties. Natural Gas Measurement The Company records estimated amounts for natural gas revenues and natural gas purchase costs based on volumetric calculations under its natural gas sales and purchase contracts. Variances or imbalances resulting from such calculations are inherent in natural gas sales, production, operation, measurement, and administration. Management does not believe that differences between actual and estimated natural gas revenues or purchase costs attributable to the unresolved variances or imbalances are material. Accounts Payable This account may include credit balances from outstanding checks in zero balance cash accounts. These credit balances are referred to as book overdrafts, as a component of Accounts Payable on the Balance Sheet. There were no credit balances from outstanding checks in zero balance cash accounts included in accounts payable at December 31, 2008 and 2007 as sufficient cash was available for offset. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables that the Company determines to be uncollectible based on the specific identification basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts, which is netted against the accounts receivable line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $3.5 million and $4.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Risk Management Activities From time to time, the Company enters into derivative contracts, such as natural gas and crude oil price swaps or zero-cost price collars, as a hedging strategy to manage commodity price risk associated with its production or other contractual commitments. All hedge transactions are subject to the Companys risk management policy which does not permit speculative trading activities. Gains or losses on these hedging activities are generally recognized over the period that its production or other underlying commitment is hedged 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements as an offset to the specific hedged item. Cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as cash flows from operations. If a hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity, gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period that the underlying production or other contractual commitment is delivered. Unrealized gains or losses associated with any derivative contract not considered a hedge are recognized currently in the results of operations. When the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures or is sold, extinguished or terminated, derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on the sale or settlement of the underlying item. For example, in the case of natural gas price hedges, the gain or loss is reflected in natural gas revenue. When a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if the hedge is no longer effective, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in the results of operations to the extent the market value changes in the derivative have not been offset by the effects of the price changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Stock-Based Compensation The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (revised 2004). The tax benefit for stock-based compensation is included as both a cash inflow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the Company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the Companys income taxes payable. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2006, the Company realized tax benefits of $10.7 million and $9.5 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company did not recognize a tax benefit for stock-based compensation as a result of the tax net operating loss position for the year under the Alternative Minimum Tax system. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the cash and cash equivalents are primarily concentrated in two financial institutions. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of these institutions and considers any possible credit risk to be minimal. Excluded from cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 is $11.6 million of restricted cash. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Environmental Matters Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed. Liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when received. Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements, the Company follows generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates pertain to proved natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil reserves and related cash flow estimates used in impairment tests of oil and gas properties, natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil revenues and expenses, current values of derivative instruments, as well as estimates of expenses related to legal, environmental and other 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements contingencies, depreciation, depletion and amortization, pension and postretirement obligations, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
