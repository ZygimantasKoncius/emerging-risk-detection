Overview We are a Delaware limited partnership formed to engage in the distribution of motor fuels, consisting of gasoline and diesel fuel, and to own and lease real estate used in the retail distribution of motor fuels. Our primary business objective is to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, to increase our quarterly cash distributions. The amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the board of directors of our General Partner which may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions. We own and lease sites primarily located in prime locations with strong motor fuel demand. Our sites are located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Maine, Florida, Maryland, Delaware, Tennessee, Virginia, Illinois, Indiana and West Virginia. We also distribute motor fuel in Georgia and North Carolina. As a result of the Erickson and Landmark acquisitions in 2015, we also own and lease sites in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Texas. Based on the most recent data available from the Energy Information Agency, of the 23 states in which we distribute motor fuel, nine were among the top ten consumers of gasoline in the United States and eight were among the top ten consumers of on-highway diesel fuel in the United States for 2013. We operate in two segments, wholesale and retail. Since our Predecessor was founded in 1992, we have generated revenues from the wholesale distribution of motor fuels to retail sites and from real estate leases. In the third quarter of 2013, we also began generating revenues, on a select basis, through the retail distribution of motor fuels at sites operated by commission agents. In the second quarter of 2014, as a result of the PMI acquisition, we began generating revenues from the operation of 87 convenience stores and nine branded, co-located quick-service restaurants. We believe consistent demand for motor fuels in the areas where we operate and the contractual nature of our rent income provides a stable source of cash flow. Cash flows from the wholesale distribution of motor fuels are generated primarily by a per gallon margin that is either a fixed or variable mark-up per gallon, depending on our contract terms. By delivering most motor fuels through independent carriers on the same day we purchase the motor fuels from suppliers, we seek to minimize the commodity price risks typically associated with the purchase and sale of motor fuels. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we were one of the ten largest independent distributors by volume in the United States for ExxonMobil, BP and Motiva. Approximately 95% of the motor fuels we distributed in the year ended December 31, 2014 were branded, including Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf and Citgo brands. 4 Table of Contents We also generate revenues from rent income primarily by collecting rent from lessee dealers, commission agents, CST and LGO pursuant to lease agreements. Our lease agreements with lessee dealers, commission agents, CST and LGO had average remaining lease terms of approximately 2.7, 3.3, 9.8 and 13.1 years as of December 31, 2014, respectively. The terms of our lease agreements with the operators generally run concurrently with the terms of the wholesale supply agreements at the sites, and the lease agreements generally require the operators to purchase their motor fuel from us. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 60% of the sites to which we distribute motor fuels were owned or leased by us. In addition, we have agreements requiring the operators of these sites to purchase motor fuels from us. As noted above, in the third quarter of 2013, we also began generating revenues from the retail distribution of motor fuels. As of December 31, 2014, we sold retail fuels at approximately 163 sites. At 76 of these sites, we operate the retail fuel operations through a third-party commission agent and lease the non-fuel site operations to the commission agent. Our lease agreements with the commission agents had an average remaining lease term of approximately 3.3 years as of December 31, 2014. The commission agent pays rent to us for the use of the non-fuel related real and personal property at the site. The commission agent operates the non-fuel related operations at the site for its own account and receives from us a fixed rate per gallon of motor fuel distributed to the retail consumer. Following our PMI acquisition in the second quarter of 2014, we also began directly distributing retail fuel at 87 convenience stores. In addition to retail fuel distribution at these sites, we also operate and generate revenues from the convenience stores and nine branded, co-located quick-service restaurants. For 2014, we distributed an aggregate of approximately 906.2 million gallons of motor fuels. As of December 31, 2014, we distributed motor fuels to 1,074 sites, comprised of the following classes of trade:  416 sites operated by independent dealers;  21 sites owned by us and operated by CST;  200 sites owned or leased by us and operated by LGO;  274 sites owned or leased by us and operated by lessee dealers;  76 sites owned or leased by us and operated by commission agents;  87 sites owned or leased and operated by us; and  17 sub-wholesalers and sold various other products to commercial and residential customers. Business Strategies Our primary business objective is to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, to increase our quarterly cash distributions by executing the following strategies:  Utilize our relationship with CST to maintain and grow our cash flow. We intend to acquire real estate, wholesale fuel distribution and related assets from CST that are expected to generate additional income. We also plan to pursue strategic business acquisition opportunities jointly with CST.  Expand within and beyond our core markets through acquisitions. Since our IPO in October 2012 and through February 20, 2015, we completed eleven acquisitions, acquiring a total of 337 fee and leasehold sites for total consideration of $488.3 million. We intend to continue to grow our business through strategic and accretive acquisitions of sites and wholesale distribution businesses both within our existing area of operations and in new geographic areas. We expect our relationship with CST will enhance our ability to execute acquisitions.  Own or lease sites in prime locations and seek to enhance the cash flow potential of these sites. As of December 31, 2014, we owned or leased 658 sites that are primarily located in prime locations with strong motor fuel demand. These sites serve customers seeking convenient fueling locations on roads and intersections with heavy traffic. We constantly evaluate opportunities to enhance the cash flow potential of our sites. For example, at our sites we may install car washes, convert service bays into convenience stores or upgrade convenience stores to quick service restaurants. These enhancements improve our ability to charge increased rents and increase the wholesale distribution potential of these sites.  Increase our wholesale motor fuel distribution business by expanding market share. As we seek to increase the number of sites we own and lease, we expect to have a commensurate increase in our wholesale distribution business due to the addition of these new sites. Furthermore, we believe that our standing in 2014 as a top ten independent distributor by volume in the United States for ExxonMobil, BP and Motiva enables us to capitalize on 5 Table of Contents the reduction by major integrated oil companies of the number of wholesalers with which they do business. As smaller wholesale distributors experience difficulties purchasing motor fuels from major integrated oil companies and refiners, we have been able, and believe that we will continue to be able, to successfully target and sell motor fuels to these wholesalers on a sub-wholesaling basis.  Maintain strong relationships with major integrated oil companies and refiners. Our relationships with suppliers of branded motor fuels are crucial to the operation and growth of our business. These relationships have allowed us to consistently negotiate supply agreements with competitive terms.  Manage risk by mitigating exposure to environmental liabilities. In acquiring properties, we use environmental consultants to perform due diligence regarding the property to assess the exposure to risk of environmental contamination, if any. Typically, when an acquired site requires remediation, either the seller funds an escrow account for the cost to remediate the property, or the seller retains the obligation to remediate the property. We also seek to purchase environmental insurance policies to contain costs in the event that the escrowed amounts are inadequate or if there are unknown pre-existing conditions at a location discovered in the future. In addition, we participate in state programs, where available, that may also assist in funding the costs of environmental liabilities. Competitive Strengths We believe the following competitive strengths will enable us to achieve our primary business objective:  Our relationship with CST. CST, the owner of our general partner, is one of the largest independent retailers of motor fuel and convenience merchandise items in the United States and eastern Canada with approximately 1,900 locations as of December 31, 2014. In 2014, CST distributed 1.9 billion gallons of motor fuel at its approximately 1,000 sites within the United States.  Stable cash flows from real estate rent income and wholesale motor fuel distribution. We generate revenue from rent at our sites and earn a per gallon margin on the wholesale distribution of motor fuels. We collect rent from the lessee dealers, commission agents, CST and LGO pursuant to lease agreements. Our lease agreements with lessee dealers, commission agents, CST and LGO had average remaining lease terms of approximately 2.7 years, 3.3 years, 9.8 years and 13.1 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. We sell motor fuel on a wholesale basis to lessee dealers, independent dealers, commission agents, CST, LGO and sub-wholesalers. We receive a per gallon margin that is either a fixed mark-up per gallon or a variable rate mark-up per gallon. At sites we own or lease, the term of the supply agreement is generally concurrent with the term of our lease with the lessee dealer, CST or LGO. In addition, our wholesale contracts prohibit customers from purchasing motor fuels from other distributors. We believe that the contractual nature of our rent income and the consistent demand for motor fuel in the areas where we operate provide a stable source of cash flow.  Established history of acquiring sites and successfully integrating these sites and operations into our existing business. We have grown our business from 11 owned sites in 2004 to 314 owned sites as of December 31, 2014. Since our IPO in October 2012 and through February 20, 2015, we have completed eleven acquisitions for a total of 337 fee and leasehold properties for total consideration of $488.3 million. Our strong industry relationships, access to capital, ability to complete acquisitions and environmental risk management expertise have allowed us to find multiple sites and negotiate transactions that are on attractive terms. Furthermore, we have successfully integrated our acquisitions into our existing business by reducing overhead costs and realizing economies of scale associated with our wholesale distribution business.  Long-term relationships with major integrated oil companies and refiners. We have established long-term relationships and supply agreements with companies that are among the largest suppliers of branded motor fuel in the United States. During 2014, our wholesale business purchased approximately 37%, 28% and 22% of its motor fuel from ExxonMobil (a supplier of ours since 2002), BP (a supplier of ours since 2009) and Motiva (a supplier of ours since 2004), respectively. Our prompt payment history and good credit standing with our suppliers allow us to receive certain term discounts on our fuel purchases, which increases the profitability of our wholesale distribution business. We believe that these relationships and payment terms are not easily replicated by competitors in the markets we serve.  Prime real estate locations in areas with high traffic and considerable motor fuel consumption. We derive our rent income from sites we own or lease that provide convenient fueling locations in areas that are densely populated. Based on the most recent data available from Energy Information Agency, of the 23 states in which we distribute fuel, nine were among the top ten consumers of gasoline and eight were among the top ten consumers of on-highway diesel fuel in the United States for 2013. Over 85% of our sites were located in high-traffic metropolitan and urban areas as of December 31, 2014. We believe that the limited availability of undeveloped real estate, particularly in the northeastern U.S., presents a high barrier to entry for the development of competing sites. 6 Table of Contents  Financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions and other expansion opportunities. We amended and restated our credit facility in September 2014 to provide additional liquidity, and as of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $333.2 million in nominal availability under our credit facility for future acquisitions or working capital purposes, depending on our needs. We also raised $135.0 million of net proceeds in an equity offering in September 2014. We believe that our borrowing capabilities available under our credit agreement and our ability to access the public capital markets provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisition and expansion opportunities.  Extensive industry experience of our senior management team. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President have, on average, over 24 years of experience in the ownership and operation of businesses that distribute motor fuel. Furthermore, our senior management team has extensive relationships with suppliers, customers, brokers and other industry contacts that are crucial to the successful operation and growth of our business. Recent Acquisitions Since our IPO in October 2012 and through February 20, 2015, we have completed eleven acquisitions for a total of 337 fee and leasehold sites for total consideration of $488.3 million. Summarized below are our acquisitions in the past two years. Rogers Acquisition In September and October 2013, we purchased 14 motor fuel stations, three leasehold motor fuel stations, assumed certain third-party supply contracts and purchased certain other assets located primarily in the Tri-Cities region of Tennessee area for $21.1 million. This acquisition provided entry into a new geographic territory for us. Aggregate incremental revenues for the Rogers acquisition included in our statements of operations were $17.6 million for 2013. Rocky Top Acquisition In September 2013, we purchased one fee property site, three leasehold motor fuel stations, seven third-party supply contracts and certain other assets and equipment for total consideration of $10.7 million. Concurrent with the closing, we entered into a master lease for 29 motor fuel stations, which we will purchase on or after August 1, 2015, for $26.2 million. The purchased and leasehold sites are located in and around the Knoxville, Tennessee region and along Interstate Highways 40 and 75. This acquisition is geographically adjacent to the Rogers acquisition and expanded our presence in Tennessee. Aggregate incremental revenues for the Rocky Top acquisition included in our statements of operations were $23.1 million for 2013. Manchester Acquisition In December 2013, we purchased 44 independent dealer supply contracts, five sub-wholesale supply contracts, two leasehold motor fuel stations and certain other assets and equipment in Virginia for total consideration of $10.7 million. This acquisition provided entry into a new geographic territory for us. PMI Acquisition On April 28, 2014, we exercised an option (the Option) to purchase 100% of the membership interests of Pinehurst Petroleum, LLC (Pinehurst) from Joseph L. Smith III and John A. Kopfer, Jr. (collectively Smith/Kopfer) for $4.0 million. Pinehursts sole asset was an Agreement and Plan of Merger among Pinehurst, PMI Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinehurst(Sub), Petroleum Marketers, Incorporated (PMI), Petroleum Marketers, Incorporated Employee Stock Ownership Trust and Ronald R. Hare, in his capacity as representative (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Pinehurst agreed to acquire all of the shares of PMI for $73.5 million inclusive of an adjustment for working capital, through the merger(the Merger) of Sub and PMI. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the stockholders of PMI agreed to escrow $5.0 million for 25 months after the closing date of the Merger to secure the indemnity provisions contained in the Merger Agreement for the benefit of Pinehurst. The transaction was funded with borrowings under our credit facility. On April 30, 2014, pursuant to the Option, the Partnership purchased all of the equity interests of Pinehurst ($1.0 million of the consideration is included in accrued expenses and other current and noncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2014). Subsequent to such purchase, the Merger became effective and, as a result, the Partnership became the owner of PMI. 7 Table of Contents PMI operates two primary lines of business: convenience stores and petroleum products distribution. In its convenience store business, PMI operates 87 convenience stores and nine co-located branded quick service restaurants located in Virginia and West Virginia. The convenience stores distribute primarily branded fuel and operate under PMIs own proprietary convenience store brand, Stop in Food Stores. The petroleum products business distributes motor fuels and other petroleum products to customers throughout Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina. The acquisition augmented the Partnerships presence in Virginia and complements the existing Tennessee operations. On May 1, 2014, immediately subsequent to the effectiveness of the Merger, we caused PMI to divest its lubricants business (the Lubricants Business) to Zimri Holdings, LLC (Zimri), an entity owned by Smith/Kopfer, for the sum of $14.0 million pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA) between PMI and Zimri. The APA contains customary representations, warranties, agreements and obligations of the parties, as well as indemnity provisions. A trust controlled by Joseph V. Topper, Jr., Chairman and CEO of the General Partner, financed the purchase of the Lubricants Business by Zimri pursuant to a loan to Zimri. The financing by Mr. Toppers trust was approved by the former conflicts committee of the board of directors of the General Partner. In 2014, the trust that financed the purchase acquired the Lubricants Business. Atlas Acquisition On May 19, 2014, we completed our acquisition of 52 wholesale supply contracts, one sub-wholesaler contract, five fee sites, six leasehold sites and certain other assets from affiliates of Atlas Oil Company (Atlas) for $34.0 million. In addition, we acquired certain short-term notes receivable associated with the wholesale supply and commission marketing contracts for $5.2 million, bringing total consideration to $39.2 million, subject to closing adjustments. The transaction was funded by borrowings under our credit facility and $4.0 million of proceeds from the sale of the Lubricants Business that were directed to an escrow agent as part of an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 like-kind exchange. These assets are located in the Chicago, Illinois area and are branded BP. The wholesale supply contracts have a remaining average term of 15 years and the fee or leasehold sites are currently leased to third party commission agents. The short-term notes receivable relate to previously negotiated purchase agreements of certain sites by the dealers occupying the locations. All of the notes receivable relate to sites supplied under contracts acquired in this transaction. In connection with the acquisition of PMI and assets from certain affiliates of Atlas, we amended our Omnibus Agreement, dated October 30, 2012, with our General Partner, DMI, LGO, and Joseph V. Topper, Jr. (as so amended, the Original Omnibus Agreement) with regards to the management fee payable by us to DMI effective July 1, 2014 (and to CST since October 1, 2014). The revised management fee consists of a base monthly fee of $670,000 per month and a variable fee of between zero and $0.003 per gallon for wholesale fuel distribution and $0.015 per gallon for retail fuel distribution at sites we operate. The General Partner and CST may waive all or any portion of the management fee to the extent that all or a portion of the management services are either purchased from another party or not required. Nice N Easy Acquisition Effective November 1, 2014 (the Closing Date), CST and the Partnership jointly entered into an agreement to purchase the convenience store assets, franchisor rights, and associated trademarks of Nice N Easy Grocery Shoppes, located in central New York with a concentration in the Syracuse, NY region. Effective on the Closing Date, CST assigned the rights to acquire real property, including underground storage tanks and canopies, at 23 sites to LGWS and the related fuel distribution agreements to LGW, for aggregate cash consideration of $53.8 million (the Purchase Price). In addition, LGWS entered into a lease with a subsidiary of CST for the acquired real estate and LGW entered into a wholesale fuel distribution agreement with a subsidiary of CST. CST operates the sites and purchased the working capital of the acquired assets. The Partnership funded the Purchase Price with borrowings under its credit facility. Drop Down of Fuel Supply Interests Pursuant to a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement), dated December 16, 2014, by and among the Partnership, CST and CST Services LLC (CST Services), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CST, on January 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition, effective January 1, 2015, of a 5% limited partner interest in CST Fuel Supply LP (CST Fuel) from CST Services in exchange for 1,497,946 newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. CST Fuel owns 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in CST Marketing and Supply LLC (CSTMS), which is a party to a fuel supply agreement with a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation. The general partner of CST Fuel is CST USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CST. CST continues to indirectly own a 95% limited partner interest in CST Fuel. 8 Table of Contents Immediately prior to closing and effective January 1, 2015, CST Services, CSTMS and certain subsidiaries of CST Services (Purchasers) entered into a fuel distribution agreement (the Fuel Distribution Agreement), pursuant to which CSTMS, on an annual basis, sells and delivers to the Purchasers, and the Purchasers will purchase, for at least 10 years no less than 1.57 billion gallons of branded and unbranded motor fuels at a fixed net margin of $0.05 per gallon for resale at retail sites operated by such Purchasers. The terms of the Contribution Agreement and Fuel Distribution Agreement were approved by the independent conflicts committee of the board of directors of the General Partner. The conflicts committee retained independent legal and financial advisors to assist in evaluating and negotiating the transaction. In approving the transaction, the conflicts committee based its decisions in part on an opinion from its independent financial advisor that the consideration to be paid by the Partnership is fair to the unaffiliated common unitholders of the Partnership from a financial point of view. Landmark Acquisition On January 8, 2015, CST and the Partnership jointly purchased 22 convenience stores from Landmark Industries. The stores operate under the Timewise brand name and provide Shell branded fuel. The sites are all owned fee simple and are located primarily in the San Antonio area. We purchased all of the real property and underground storage tanks as well as certain wholesale fuel distribution assets for $43.5 million, funded by borrowings under our Credit Facility. CST purchased the remaining personal property, working capital and the convenience store operations. The allocation of the purchase price between the Partnership and CST is subject to adjustment following completion of real property appraisals. LGWS leases the acquired real estate to CST under triple net leases and LGW distributes wholesale fuel to CST under long term agreements with a fuel gross profit margin of approximately $0.05 per gallon. Erickson Acquisition On February 17, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson Oil Products, Inc. (Erickson) and certain related assets from GST Non-Exempt Family Trust Created Under the David B. Erickson Revocable Trust UAD May 12, 2010 and GST Exempt Family Trust Created Under the David B. Erickson Revocable Trust UAD May 12, 2010 (collectively, the Stock Sellers), and certain real estate from Team Investments, LLC (together with the Stock Sellers, the Sellers). The purchase price was $85 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments and indemnification and environmental remediation escrows, and was funded by borrowings under the Credit Facility. Erickson operates 64 convenience store sites located in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin and South Dakota, with a concentration in the Minneapolis / St. Paul region, of which 59 are owned in fee simple and five are leased under long term leases. In connection with the purchase, the Sellers and certain principals of the Sellers have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to engage directly or indirectly in the retail petroleum or convenience store business in a designated geographic area surrounding the purchased convenience store sites for a period of four years following the closing. 9 Table of Contents Wholesale Segment General The following table highlights the aggregate volume of motor fuel distributed by the wholesale distribution operations to each of the principal customer groups by gallons sold for the periods (in millions): Lehigh GasGroup (a) CrossAmericaPartners LP Combined CrossAmericaPartners LP CrossAmericaPartners LP Period fromJanuary 1 toOctober 30,2012 Period fromOctober 31 toDecember 31,2012 Year EndedDecember 31,2012 Year EndedDecember 31,2013 Year EndedDecember 31,2014 Gallons of motor fuel distributed to: Lessee dealers 91.6 18.0 109.6 126.5 143.8 Independent dealers 139.9 26.9 166.8 189.3 348.4 CST     4.9 LGO 201.1 44.7 245.8 253.5 224.0 Commission agents    20.3 73.2 Sub-wholesalers 70.1 14.0 84.1 48.2 48 Company Operated 63.9 Total 502.7 103.6 606.3 637.8 906.2 (a) Includes motor fuel distributed to customers of the Lehigh Gas Group. We purchase branded and unbranded motor fuel from major integrated oil companies, refiners and unbranded fuel suppliers. We distribute motor fuel to lessee dealers, independent dealers, CST, LGO and sub-wholesalers. We are a distributor of various brands of motor fuel as well as unbranded motor fuel. We are one of the top ten largest independent distributors by volume of ExxonMobil, BP and Shell-branded motor fuel in the United States, and we also distribute Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf and Citgo-branded motor fuels. We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon on approximately 84% of our gallons sold (based on fourth quarter volumes), which reduces the overall variability of our financial results. We receive a variable rate mark-up per gallon on the remaining gallons sold. A significant component of our fuel margin is the discount for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives offered by our suppliers. Prompt payment discounts from suppliers is based on a percentage of the purchase price of fuel and the dollar value of these discounts varies with fuel prices. Arrangements with Lessee Dealers and Independent Dealers We distribute motor fuel to lessee dealers and independent dealers under supply agreements. Under our supply agreements, we agree to supply a particular branded motor fuel or unbranded motor fuel to a site or group of sites and arrange for all transportation. We receive a per gallon margin that is either a fixed mark-up per gallon or a variable rate mark-up per gallon. The initial term of most independent dealer supply agreements is ten years. After a trial period, the initial term of most lessee dealer supply agreements is generally three years. These supply agreements require, among other things, dealers to maintain standards established by the applicable brand. We may provide credit terms to our lessee dealers and independent dealers, which are generally no longer than three days. As of December 31, 2014, the average remaining contract term for our independent dealers and lessee dealers was 5.1 years and 2.7 years, respectively. Arrangements with Sub-Wholesalers We distribute motor fuel to sub-wholesalers under supply agreements. Under our supply agreements, we agree to supply a particular branded motor fuel or unbranded motor fuel to the sub-wholesaler. Motor fuels are sold to the sub-wholesalers at rack plus. The rack price is the price at which a wholesale distributor generally purchases motor fuel from an integrated oil company or refiner at the terminal. The sub-wholesaler is responsible for arranging and paying for all transportation, insurance and all other costs and services for the distribution of motor fuels. The initial term of most sub-wholesaler supply agreements is three to ten years. We may provide credit terms to our sub-wholesalers, which are generally within ten days. As of December 31, 2014, the average remaining contract term for our contracts with sub-wholesalers was 1.3 years. Arrangement with CST In conjunction with our joint purchases of Nice N Easy and Landmark with CST, we entered into a 10-year fuel distribution agreement with CST pursuant to which we distribute to CST motor fuels at a fixed mark-up per gallon. CST retains the retail income it earns from the sites and is responsible for operating the sites and for paying expenses incurred in connection with 10 Table of Contents the operation of the sites including, but not limited to, utilities, insurance, licenses and employee costs. We enter into 10-year lease agreements with CST pursuant to which CST leases real property and the underground storage tanks from us. As of December 31, 2014, the remaining term on our fuel distribution and real estate leases agreement with CST was 9.8 years. Arrangement with LGO Prior to the IPO, our Predecessors retail operations were transferred to LGO, a non-contributed entity managed by Joseph V. Topper, Jr. We entered into a 15-year wholesale supply agreement with LGO pursuant to which we distributed to LGO motor fuels at a variable rate mark-up per gallon consistent with market mark-ups through September 30, 2014. Since October 1, 2014, we distribute to LGO at a fixed mark-up per gallon. LGO retains the retail income it earns from the sites and is responsible for operating the sites and for paying expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the sites including, but not limited to, utilities, insurance, licenses and employee costs. We enter into 15-year lease agreements with LGO pursuant to which LGO leases sites from us. As of December 31, 2014, the remaining term on our wholesale supply agreement with LGO was 12.8 years. 11 Table of Contents Supplier Arrangements We distribute branded motor fuel under the ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf and Citgo brands to our customers. Branded motor fuels are purchased from major integrated oil companies and refiners under supply agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our wholesale business purchased approximately 37%, 28% and 22% of its motor fuel from ExxonMobil (a supplier of ours since 2002), BP (a supplier of ours since 2009) and Motiva (a supplier of ours since 2004), respectively. We purchase the motor fuel at the suppliers applicable terminal rack price, which typically changes daily. In addition, each supply agreement typically contains provisions relating to, among other things, payment terms, use of the suppliers brand names, provisions relating to credit card processing, insurance coverage and compliance with legal and environmental requirements. As is typical in the industry, a supplier generally can terminate the supply contract if we do not comply with any material condition of the contract, including if we were to fail to make payments when due, or if we are involved in fraud, criminal misconduct, bankruptcy or insolvency. Each supply agreement has provisions that obligates the supplier, subject to certain limitations, to sell up to an agreed upon number of gallons. Any amount in excess is subject to availability. Certain suppliers offer volume rebates or incentive payments to drive volumes and provide an incentive for branding new locations. Certain suppliers require that all or a portion of any such incentive payments be repaid to the supplier in the event that the sites are rebranded within a stated number of years. We also purchase unbranded motor fuel for distribution at the rack price. A significant component of our fuel margin is the discount for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives offered by our suppliers. As of December 31, 2014, our supply agreements had a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 8.7 years. Selection and Recruitment of Site Operators We constantly evaluate existing and potential site operators based on their creditworthiness and the quality of their site and operation as determined by size and location of the site, monthly volumes of motor fuel sold, overall financial performance and previous operating experience. At times, we convert our sites from one class of trade to another to optimize profitability. Retail Segment Arrangement with Commission Agents Prior to September 1, 2013, we leased certain sites to LGO, which, in turn, subleased certain of these sites (the Subleases) to third party commission agents and entered into commission agreements with the agents to sell motor fuel on behalf of LGO to retail customers (the Commission Agreements). In connection with the Commission Agreements, LGO also purchased motor fuel from a subsidiary of the Partnership at wholesale prices. Effective September 1, 2013, we assumed the Commission Agreements and Subleases from LGO and terminated our leases with LGO for the Commission Sites. As a result, we now record the retail sale of motor fuels to the end customer and accrue a commission payable to the commission agent at the Commission Sites. We paid LGO $3.5 million (the Purchase Price) for the Subleases and Commission Agreements and $2.1 million for the motor fuel inventory. The commission agent at each site operates all the non-fuel operations at the site for its own account, pays rent to us for the use of the site and receives a commission for each gallon of motor fuel sold at the site. At the Commission Sites, we own the motor fuel inventory, determine the retail pricing of motor fuel and generate revenue from the sale of motor fuel to the retail consumer. We maintain inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer at these sites. The retail fuel margin at the Commission Sites is non-qualifying income for federal income tax purposes and is recorded in LGWS, our taxable C-Corp subsidiary. LGW sells fuel on a wholesale basis to LGWS for the Commission Sites and this income is qualifying income for federal income tax purposes and included in the results of the Wholesale segment in our consolidated financial statements. Company Operated Sites Commencing with our PMI acquisition in April 2014, we operate 87 convenience stores in Virginia and West Virginia and retain all profits from the fuel and non-fuel operations. We own the motor fuel inventory at the sites, set the fuel pricing at the sites, and generate revenue from the retail sale of motor fuels to the end customer. We maintain inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer. The inventory amount at the sites averages about 3-days worth of motor fuels sales. LGW distributes on a wholesale basis a significant portion of the fuel required by PMI, which owns the motor fuel inventory and distributes fuel to retail customers. LGW records qualifying wholesale fuel distribution gross income and PMI records the non-qualifying retail distribution gross income. 12 Table of Contents Real Estate Site Locations As of December 31, 2014, we owned or leased 658 sites located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Ohio, Tennessee, Florida, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Indiana and Delaware. Of those, 314 are owned fee simple and 344 sites we leased from third-party landlords. Over 85% of our sites are located in high-traffic metropolitan and urban areas. Our emphasis on acquiring, by purchase or lease, sites primarily in prime locations with strong motor fuel demand allows us to benefit from high traffic counts and customers seeking convenient fueling locations. We believe that sites in high traffic areas are highly desirable to other gas station operators as well as attractive locations for other entities that may use the land for alternative purposes. As a result of the limited availability of undeveloped real estate in these areas, particularly in the northeastern U.S., we believe the locations of our sites present high barriers of entry for new retail gas station operators to compete with the operators of our sites. The following table shows the geographic distribution by state of the aggregate number of sites we owned or leased at December 31, 2014: OwnedSites LeasedSites TotalSites Percentage ofTotal Sites Pennsylvania 75 56 131 20 % New Jersey 58 49 107 16 % Virginia (a) 33 50 83 13 % Ohio 58 18 76 12 % Massachusetts 3 67 70 11 % Tennessee 43 7 50 8 % Florida 9 37 46 7 % New York 27 5 32 5 % New Hampshire  21 21 3 % West Virginia  14 14 2 % Illinois 4 4 8 1 % Maine  8 8 1 % Kentucky 3 4 7 1 % Indiana 1 2 3 * Delaware  1 1 * Maryland  1 1 * Total 314 344 658 100 % (a) Includes company operated retail sites acquired in April 2014. * Less than 1% In aggregate for fee and lease sites, the average remaining term as of December 31, 2014 for our leases with lessee dealers, commission agents, CST and LGO was 2.7 years, 3.3 years, 9.8 years and 13.1 years, respectively. Sites Owned We owned 314 sites as of December 31, 2014. We generally have focused on selectively acquiring sites within or contiguous to our existing market areas. In evaluating potential acquisition candidates, we consider a number of factors, including strategic fit, desirability of location, cost efficiency of serving the site with our wholesale business, price and our ability to improve the productivity and cash flow potential of a site. We consider acquiring ownership of sites that are not within or contiguous to our current markets if the opportunity meets certain criteria including, among others, the availability of other sites in the area, motor traffic, potential sales volumes and cash flow potential. We derive our rent income from sites we own that provide convenient fueling locations primarily in areas that are densely populated. We collect rent from the lessee dealers, commission agents, CST and LGO pursuant to lease agreements. The average remaining lease term for our lessee dealers, commission agents, CST and LGO at our owned sites as of December 31, 2014 was 2.1 years, 3.5 years, 9.8 years and 13.3 years, respectively. 13 Table of Contents Sites Leased As of December 31, 2014, we also leased 344 sites from third parties and then sub-leased these sites to lessee dealers, commission agents and LGO. The average remaining lease term for sites we lease from third parties, excluding the sale-leasebacks further discussed below, is 8.6 years as of December 31, 2014. Our sub-leases with the lessee dealers typically have three-year terms. The average remaining sub-lease term for sites we sub-lease to lessee dealers, commission agents and LGO was 3.2 years, 2.8 years and 13.0 years as of December 31, 2014, respectively. Personal Property Rent Income The rent income we earn from sites we own or lease includes rent income associated with the personal property located on these sites, such as underground storage tanks and motor fuel pumps. The rent income we earn from leasing the personal property we own or lease may not be a qualified source of income. As a result, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lehigh Gas Wholesale Services, Inc., a taxable C corporation, owns and leases (or leases and then sub-leases) certain of our personal property. Accordingly, rent income earned by Lehigh Gas Wholesale Services, Inc. on the personal property is taxed at the applicable corporate income tax rate. Site Dispositions We continually evaluate the performance of each of our sites to determine whether any particular site should be closed or sold based on profitability, trends and our competition in the surrounding area, as well as whether the site may be attractive to a buyer that may use it for an alternative purpose. The majority of the sites we have acquired were purchased from major integrated oil companies and other industry participants undertaking a process to divest large numbers of sites in single-sale transactions where potential buyers typically are not permitted to make offers on single or selected sites. Accordingly, we historically have purchased a number of sites that may not fit our strategic and geographic plans. We have, however, been successful at selling sites, which may not fit our strategic and geographic plans, at prices that we deem attractive under the circumstances. As part of the sale process for these sites, we attempt to enter into supply agreements with the purchasers of these sites so that we can distribute motor fuel to them after we sell them. Typically, we seek to use the proceeds from the sale of these sites to buy additional sites that better fit our strategic and geographic model. Seasonality Due to the nature of our business and our customers reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we experience more demand for motor fuel during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, particularly in the northeastern U.S., increasing the demand for motor fuel that we distribute as well as the fuel we sell at our retail locations. Therefore, our distribution volumes are typically higher in the second and third quarters of the year and our results from operations may vary from quarter to quarter. However, the impact of seasonality has lessened with the recent acquisitions in new markets. Competition Our wholesale distribution operation primarily competes with other motor fuel distributors. We do not generally compete with major integrated oil companies as they have exited the wholesale distribution business in the markets in which we operate. We may encounter more significant competition if major integrated oil companies alter their current business strategy and decide to re-enter the wholesale distribution business, thereby reducing and/or eliminating their need to rely on wholesale distributors. In addition, independent dealers or sub-wholesalers may choose to purchase their motor fuel supplies directly from the major integrated oil companies. Major competitive factors for our wholesale operations include, among others, customer service, price and quality of service. The retail industry is highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering products and services of the type we sell in our convenience stores. We compete with other convenience store chains, independently owned convenience stores, motor fuel stations, supermarkets, drugstores, discount stores, dollar stores, club stores and hypermarkets. Over the past ten years, several non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and hypermarkets, have impacted the convenience store industry, particularly in the geographic areas in which we operate, by entering the motor fuel retail business. These non-traditional motor fuel retailers have captured a significant share of the retail motor fuel market, and we expect their market share will continue to grow. In addition, some large retailers and supermarkets are adjusting their store layouts and product prices in an attempt to appeal to convenience store customers. Major competitive factors include, among others, location, ease of access, product and service selection, motor fuel brands, pricing, customer service, store appearance, cleanliness and safety. 14 Table of Contents Environmental Environmental Laws and Regulations We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to underground storage tanks, the release or discharge of hazardous materials into the air, water and soil, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, and the health and safety of employees. Environmental laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:  requiring remedial action to mitigate releases of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes caused by our operations or attributable to former operators;  requiring capital expenditures to comply with environmental control requirements; and  enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes have been released or disposed of. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other wastes into the environment. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and minimize the costs of such compliance. We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We can provide no assurance, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Hazardous Substances and Releases In most instances, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our business relate to the release of hazardous wastes into the water or soils and include measures to control pollution of the environment. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Under the Superfund law, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. The Superfund law also authorizes the EPA, and in some instances third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible persons the costs they incur. It is possible for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate waste that falls within the Superfund laws definition of a hazardous substance, and as a result, we may be jointly and severally liable under the Superfund law for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which those hazardous substances have been released into the environment. 15 Table of Contents We currently own or lease sites where motor fuels are or have been handled for many years. Although we and our consultants have utilized operating and disposal practices in accordance with industry standards, wastes produced from remediation efforts require disposal at sites owned/operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal practices are not under our control. These sites and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the Superfund law or other federal and state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators, to clean up contaminated property. DMI is in the process of investigating and remediating contamination at a number of our sites as a result of recent or historic releases of petroleum products. At many sites, DMI is entitled to reimbursement from third parties for certain of these costs under third-party contractual indemnities, state trust funds and insurances policies, in each case, subject to specified deductibles, per incident, annual and aggregate caps and specific eligibility requirements. Although DMI will be required to indemnify us for these costs to the extent third parties (including insurers) fail to pay for remediation as DMI anticipates, insurance and indemnification are unavailable, and/or the state trust funds cease to exist or become insolvent, we may be obligated to pay these additional costs. Water Discharges The federal Clean Water Act imposes restrictions regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. This law and comparable state laws require permits for discharging pollutants into state and federal waters and impose substantial liabilities for noncompliance. EPA regulations also require us to obtain permits to discharge certain storm water runoff. Storm water discharge permits also may be required by certain states in which we operate. We believe that we hold the required permits and operate in material compliance with those permits. While we have experienced permit discharge exceedences, we do not expect any non-compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Air Emissions Under the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local laws, permits are typically required to emit regulated air pollutants into the atmosphere. We believe that we currently hold or have applied for all necessary air permits and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable air laws and regulations. Although we can give no assurances, we are aware of no changes to air quality regulations that will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe product quality specifications for the motor fuels that we sell, largely in an effort to reduce air pollution. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in substantial penalties. Although we can give no assurances, we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with these regulations. Efforts at the federal and state level are currently underway to reduce the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from various sources in the United States. Even in the absence of new federal legislation, GHG emissions have begun to be regulated by the EPA pursuant to the Clean Air Act. For example, in April 2010, the EPA set a new emissions standard for motor vehicles to reduce GHG emissions. New federal or state restrictions on emissions of GHGs that may be imposed in areas of the United States in which we conduct business and that apply to our operations could adversely affect the demand for our products. Environmental Insurance and Escrow Accounts We are protected as an additional named insured by insurance which may cover in whole or in part certain expenditures to investigate, monitor and otherwise respond to releases of hazardous materials including petroleum products. We maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles as our General Partner believes are reasonable and prudent. Before acquiring the property underlying a site, we use an environmental consultant to perform due diligence regarding the site to assess the exposure to risk of contamination, if any, at each site. Generally, when acquired sites require remediation, either the seller funds an escrow account for the cost to remediate the property, or the seller retains the obligation to remediate the property. In the circumstances where monies are placed in escrow to cover the estimated cost of remediation for known contamination, the accounts are used to pay for the appropriate remediation tasks, which are contracted out to remediation firms. In certain circumstances, insurance policies have also been procured to protect against remediation cost overruns. 16 Table of Contents With each acquisition, pollution insurance was procured to cover risks associated with unknown historic contamination that might not be identified during due diligence. In addition, we also participate in state insurance programs or obtain insurance policies in states that do not have programs to cover new contamination that arises post-acquisition. As of December 31, 2014, DMI had an aggregate of $5.1 million in escrow funds available to cover known contaminations at our existing sites. In addition to the escrow accounts, DMI maintains pollution insurance policies with total aggregate limits in excess of $85 million. In addition to the foregoing, on October 29, 2012, a master pollution policy was procured covering new conditions at all properties, including remediation and third-party liabilities. This policy treats any pollution condition that arose subsequent to the acquisition of the property by the predecessor entities as new. This policy also affords excess coverage to our underground storage tank policies and state programs and has $10.0 million in aggregate limits. Furthermore, in keeping with our practice of maintaining insurance for all of our acquisitions, upon completion of each acquisition, new transactional pollution policies are procured with limits of at least $5.0 million (for significant acquisitions). These policies typically are written as no-retroactive date coverage, meaning they provide coverage (for remediation costs and third party claims) arising from unknown, historic pollution conditions, as well as from new conditions arising post acquisition, without limitations on when the pollution condition first arose . For any smaller or single-site acquisitions, coverage for such sites is typically endorsed on the master policy identified above. Furthermore, the Partnership has coverage for new releases from its underground storage tanks through state run underground storage tank funds. In states where underground storage tank funds do not exist, the Partnership procures insurance specifically covering losses from its underground storage tanks. Thus, in addition to the insurance protection afforded under the DMI pollution policies identified above, as well as state funds, as of December 31, 2014, the Partnership maintains pollution insurance policies with total aggregate limits in excess of $50 million and continues to grow its pollution insurance portfolio with each acquisition. While the Partnership generally views its pollution insurance portfolio as an excellent balance against the inherent risk associated with acquiring and maintaining a portfolio of gas stations, these policies and escrow amounts may not cover all environmental risks and costs, and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us. Security Regulation Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy infrastructure assets may be future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected our operations to increased risks. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Any global and domestic economic repercussions from terrorist activities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. For instance, terrorist activity could lead to increased volatility in prices for motor fuels and other products we sell. Insurance carriers are currently required to offer coverage for terrorist activities as a result of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). We purchased this coverage under our property and casualty insurance programs, which resulted in additional insurance premiums. Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, TRIA has been extended through December 31, 2016. Although we cannot determine the future availability and cost of insurance coverage for terrorist acts, we do not expect the availability and cost of such insurance to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Employee Safety Neither we, our subsidiaries, nor our General Partner have any employees. Substantially all of our executive management personnel were employees of DMI through December 31, 2014 and are employees of CST since January 1, 2015. CST will provide us with the management and labor sufficient to carry on our business. DMI and CST are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHAs hazard communication standards require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that DMI and CST are in substantial compliance with the applicable OSHA requirements. 17 Table of Contents Title to Properties, Permits and Licenses We believe we have all of the assets needed, including leases, permits and licenses, to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any consents, permits or authorizations that have not been obtained, we believe that the failure to obtain these consents, permits or authorizations will have no material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We believe we have satisfactory title to all of our assets. Title to property may be subject to encumbrances, including repurchase rights and use, operating and environmental covenants and restrictions, including restrictions on branded motor fuels that may be sold at such sites. We believe that none of these encumbrances will materially detract from the value of our sites or from our interest in these sites, nor will they materially interfere with the use of these sites in the operation of our business. These encumbrances may, however, impact our ability to sell the site to an entity seeking to use the land for alternative purposes. Facilities Our principal executive offices are in Allentown, Pennsylvania in an office space leased by DMI. The management fee charged by CST to the Partnership incorporates a rental charge. The lease expires on June 30, 2029. Employees Our General Partner manages our operations and activities on our behalf. Substantially all of our executive management personnel were employees of DMI through December 31, 2014 and are employees of CST since January 1, 2015. We and our General Partner have entered into an Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement with CST pursuant to which CST provides to us and our General Partner management services and manages our business and affairs. Similar to the Partnership, PMI has no employees. The management and store personnel are generally employees of a related party, Pinehurst Services LLC, to which PMI pays a management fee. As of December 31, 2014 there are 89 employees of CST providing the Partnership services under the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement that support the Partnership. No employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2014, Pinehurst Services LLC had 949 employees. Available Information We make available, free of charge on our Internet website (http://www.crossamericapartners.com), our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, we might not be able to pay distributions on our common units, the trading price of our common units could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Also, please read Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Limited partner interests are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business. 18 Table of Contents Risks Inherent in Our Business We may not have sufficient cash from operations to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses. We may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay the minimum quarterly distribution of at least $0.4375 per unit, or $1.75 per unit per year. The minimum quarterly distribution is an amount that must be paid to holders of our common units, including any arrearages, before any distributions may be made to holders of our subordinated units, to the extent that any distributions are made. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:  demand for motor fuel products in the markets we serve, including seasonal fluctuations, and the margin per gallon we earn selling and distributing motor fuel;  the industries in which we operate are subject to seasonal trends, which may cause our operating costs to fluctuate, affecting our earnings;  severe storms could adversely affect our business by damaging our suppliers operations or lowering our sales volumes;  competition from other companies that sell motor fuel products or operate convenience stores in our targeted market areas;  the inability to identify and acquire suitable sites or to negotiate acceptable leases for such sites;  the potential inability to obtain adequate financing to fund our expansion;  the level of our operating costs, including payments to CST;  prevailing economic conditions  regulatory actions affecting the supply of or demand for motor fuel, our operations, our existing contracts or our operating costs; and  volatility of prices for motor fuel. In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors such as:  the level of capital expenditures we make;  the restrictions contained in our credit agreements;  our debt service requirements;  the cost of acquisitions;  fluctuations in our working capital needs;  our ability to borrow under our credit agreements to make distributions to our unitholders; and  the amount, if any, of cash reserves established by our General Partner in its discretion. We do not have a legal obligation to pay quarterly distributions at our minimum quarterly distribution rate or at any other rate. There is no guarantee that we will distribute quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders in any quarter. See Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesCash Distribution Policy. The amount of cash we have available for distribution to unitholders depends primarily on our cash flow rather than on our profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions, even during periods when we record net income. The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily on our cash flow, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net income for financial accounting purposes. 19 Table of Contents If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from CST or third parties, our future growth and ability to increase distributions to unitholders will be limited. Our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash flow. Our growth strategy is based, in large part, on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of retail and wholesale fuel distribution assets by industry participants, including CST. CST has no contractual obligation to contribute any assets to us or accept any offer for its assets that we may choose to make. We may be unable to make accretive acquisitions for any of the following reasons:  we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts for them;  we are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms;  we are outbid by competitors; or  we or the seller are unable to obtain any necessary consents. If we are unable to make acquisitions from CST or third parties, our future growth and ability to increase distributions to unitholders will be limited. In addition, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may also consummate acquisitions, which at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive, but ultimately may not be accretive. If any of these events occurred, our future growth would be limited. Any acquisitions, including future sales to us of assets by CST, are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to unitholders. Any acquisitions, including any future sales of assets to us by CST, involve potential risks, including, among other things:  the validity of our assumptions about revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs of the acquired business or assets, as well as assumptions about achieving synergies with our existing business;  the incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets, including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets prior to our acquisition, for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;  the costs associated with additional debt or equity capital, which may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage resulting from any additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition, or the issuance of additional common units on which we will make distributions, either of which could offset the expected accretion to our unitholders from any such acquisition and could be exacerbated by volatility in the equity or debt capital markets;  a failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as increased available cash per unit, enhanced competitive position or new customer relationships;  the inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets, particularly those in new geographic areas or in new lines of business;  a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition;  the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges;  performance from the acquired assets and businesses that is below the forecasts we used in evaluating the acquisition;  a significant increase in our working capital requirements;  competition in our targeted market areas;  customer or key employee loss from the acquired businesses; and  diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns. 20 Table of Contents In addition, our ability to purchase or lease additional sites involves certain potential risks, including the inability to identify and acquire suitable sites or to negotiate acceptable leases or subleases for such sites and difficulties in adapting our distribution and other operational and management systems to an expanded network of sites. Our reviews of businesses or assets proposed to be acquired are inherently imperfect because it generally is not feasible to perform an in-depth review of businesses and assets involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of assets and businesses may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the assets or businesses to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. For example, inspections may not always be performed on every asset, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our funds and other resources toward the acquisition of certain businesses or assets. The industries in which we operate are subject to seasonal trends, which may affect our earnings and ability to make distributions. We experience more demand for our motor fuel and food and merchandise inventory at our convenience stores and quick-service restaurants during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel, recreational activities and construction are typically higher in these months in certain of the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for motor fuel that we distribute and, therefore, increasing the demand for our convenience store inventory. Therefore, our revenues are typically higher in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our results from operations may vary widely from period to period, affecting our earnings and ability to make cash distributions. Decreases in consumer spending, travel and tourism in the areas we serve could adversely impact our wholesale distribution and retail business. In the retail motor fuel industry, customer traffic is generally driven by consumer preferences and spending trends, growth rates for automobile and commercial truck traffic and trends in travel, tourism and weather. Changes in economic conditions generally or in our targeted markets specifically could adversely impact consumer spending patterns and travel and tourism in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our ability to make distributions. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders are influenced by changes in demand for, and changes in the prices of, motor fuels, which could adversely affect our margins and our customers financial condition, contract performance and trade credit. Financial and operating results from our wholesale distribution and retail operations are influenced by price volatility and demand for motor fuels. When prices for motor fuels rise, some of our wholesale customers may have insufficient credit to purchase supply from us at their historical purchase volumes, and their retail customers or our retail customers, in turn, may reduce consumption, thereby reducing demand for our product. Furthermore, when prices are increasing, we may be unable to fully pass our additional costs to our wholesale or retail customers, resulting in lower margins for us which could adversely affect our results of operations. Both the wholesale motor fuel distribution and the retail motor fuel industries are characterized by intense competition and fragmentation, and our failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to make distributions. The market for distribution of wholesale motor fuel and the sale of retail motor fuel are highly competitive and fragmented, which results in narrow margins. We have numerous competitors, some of which may have significantly greater resources and name recognition than we do. We rely on our ability to provide value added reliable services and to control our operating costs to maintain our margins and competitive position. If we were to fail to maintain the quality of our services, wholesale customers could choose alternative distribution sources and retail customers could purchase from other retailers, each decreasing our margins. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that major integrated oil companies will not decide to distribute their own products in direct competition with us or that large wholesale customers will not attempt to buy directly from the major integrated oil companies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our ability to make distributions. 21 Table of Contents We are exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by our wholesale customers and suppliers. A tightening of credit in the financial markets or an increase in interest rates may make it more difficult for wholesale customers and suppliers to obtain financing and, depending on the degree to which it occurs, there may be a material increase in the nonpayment or other nonperformance by our customers and suppliers. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with these third parties. A material increase in the nonpayment or other nonperformance by our wholesale customers and/or suppliers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Historical and current prices for motor fuel have been volatile and significant changes in such prices in the future may adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to make distributions. Crude oil and domestic wholesale motor fuel markets are volatile. General political conditions, acts of war or terrorism and instability in oil producing regions, particularly in the Middle East, Russia, Africa and South America, could significantly impact crude oil supplies and wholesale motor fuel costs. Significant increases and volatility in wholesale motor fuel costs could result in significant increases in the retail price of motor fuel products and in lower margin per gallon. Increases in the retail price of motor fuel products could impact consumer demand for motor fuel. This volatility makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact future wholesale cost fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition. Dramatic increases in crude oil prices squeeze fuel margins because fuel costs typically increase faster than we are able to pass along the increases to customers. Higher fuel prices trigger higher credit card expenses, because credit card fees are calculated as a percentage of the transaction amount, not as a percentage of gallons sold. A significant change in any of these factors could materially impact our customers motor fuel gallon volumes, gross profit and overall customer traffic, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to make distributions. Energy efficiency and new technology may reduce the demand for our motor fuel and adversely affect our operating results. Increased conservation and technological advances, including the development of improved gas mileage vehicles and the increased usage of electrically powered cars, have adversely affected the demand for motor fuel. Future conservation measures or technological advances in fuel efficiency might reduce demand and adversely affect our operating results. We depend on three principal suppliers for the majority of our motor fuel. A disruption in supply or a change in our relationship with any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash available for distribution. ExxonMobil, BP and Motiva collectively supplied over 85% of our motor fuel purchases in 2014. Our wholesale business purchased approximately 37%, 28% and 22% of its motor fuel from ExxonMobil (a supplier of ours since 2002), BP (a supplier of ours since 2009) and Motiva (a supplier of ours since 2004), respectively. A change of motor fuel suppliers, a disruption in supply or a significant change in our pricing with any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash available for distribution. We rely on our suppliers to provide trade credit terms to adequately fund our on-going operations. Our business is impacted by the availability of trade credit to fund motor fuel purchases and inventory purchases of our convenience stores. An actual or perceived downgrade in our liquidity or operations could cause our suppliers to seek credit support in the form of additional collateral, limit the extension of trade credit or otherwise materially modify their payment terms. Any material changes in the payments terms, including payment discounts, or availability of trade credit provided by our principal suppliers could impact our liquidity, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 22 Table of Contents The convenience store industry is highly competitive and failure to effectively compete could result in lower sales and lower margins. The geographic areas in which we operate convenience stores are highly competitive. We compete with other convenience store chains, independently owned convenience stores, motor fuel stations, supermarkets, drugstores, discount stores, dollar stores, club stores, mass merchants and local restaurants. In addition, several non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have impacted the convenience store industry, particularly in the geographic areas in which we operate, by entering the motor fuel retail business. These non-traditional motor fuel retailers have captured a significant share of the motor fuels market, and it is anticipated that their market share will continue to grow. Many of our competitors have been in existence longer and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to better respond to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may incur costs or liabilities as a result of litigation or adverse publicity resulting from concerns over food quality, product safety, health or other issues that could cause consumers to avoid our restaurants. We operate convenience stores that sell food products. As a result, we may be the subject of complaints or litigation arising from food-related illness or product safety which could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, negative publicity, regardless of whether the allegations are valid, concerning food quality, food safety or other health concerns, restaurant facilities, employee relations or other matters related to our operations may materially adversely affect demand for our food and other products and could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our retail stores. The dangers inherent in the storage and transport of motor fuel could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities. We store motor fuel in underground and above ground storage tanks. Additionally, we transport a portion of our motor fuel in our own trucks, instead of by third-party carriers. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in transporting and storing motor fuel. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, traffic accidents, spills, discharges and other releases, any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, governmentally-imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others. As a result, any such event not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pending or future consumer or other litigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our retail operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide array of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, we may be party to individual personal injury, bad fuel, products liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. While we believe these actions are generally routine in nature, incidental to the operation of our business and immaterial in scope, if our assessment of any action or actions should prove inaccurate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we may be exposed to industry-wide or class-action claims arising from the products we carry, the equipment or processes we use or employ or industry-specific business practices. In recent years, several retailers have also experienced data breaches resulting in exposure of sensitive customer data, including payment card information. Any such breach of our systems, or any failure to secure our systems against such a breach, could expose us to customer litigation, as well as sanctions from the payment card industry. Retailers have also increasingly become targets of certain types of patent litigation by non practicing entities who acquire intellectual property rights solely for purposes of instituting mass litigation. While industry-specific or class action litigation of this type is less frequent in occurrence than individual consumer claims, the cost of defense and ultimate disposition may be material to our financial condition and results of operation. 23 Table of Contents Failure to comply with state laws regulating the sale of alcohol and cigarettes may result in the loss of necessary licenses and the imposition of fines and penalties on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. State laws regulate the sale of alcohol and cigarettes. A violation or change of these laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations because state and local regulatory agencies have the power to approve, revoke, suspend or deny applications for, and renewals of, permits and licenses relating to the sale of these products or to seek other remedies. Such a loss or imposition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities. We have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2014, we had $200.4 million outstanding on our existing revolving credit facility, with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $100 million. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity  Long-term Debt for a discussion of our amended and restated credit facility entered into in March 2014. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including the following:  our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;  covenants contained in our credit agreement will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, including possible acquisition opportunities;  we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders;  our debt level will make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and  our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions, such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all. Our credit facility contains operating and financial restrictions that may limit our business and financing activities. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit agreement and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our credit agreement may restrict our ability to:  make distributions if any potential default or event of default occurs;  incur additional indebtedness or guarantee other indebtedness;  grant liens or make certain negative pledges;  make certain loans or investments;  make any material change to the nature of our business, including mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions;  make capital expenditures in excess of specified levels;  acquire another company; or  enter into a sale-leaseback transaction or sale of assets. 24 Table of Contents Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our credit agreement, the debt issued under the credit agreement may become immediately due and payable, and our lenders commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, our obligations under our credit agreement will be secured by substantially all of our assets, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our credit agreement, the lenders could seek to foreclose on such assets. We may not be able to lease sites we own or sub-lease sites we lease on favorable terms and any such failure could adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We may lease and/or sub-lease certain sites to lessee dealers, commission agents, CST or to LGO where the rent expense is more than the lease payments. If we are unable to obtain tenants on favorable terms for sites we own or lease, the lease payments we receive may not be adequate to cover our rent expense for leased sites and may not be adequate to ensure that we meet our debt service requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that the margins on our wholesale distribution of motor fuels to these sites will be adequate to off-set unfavorable lease terms. The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The operations at sites we own or lease are subject to inherent risk, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions and insurance may not adequately cover any such exposure. The occurrence of a significant event or release that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash available for distribution. The presence of flammable and combustible products at our sites provides the potential for fires and explosions that could destroy both property and human life. Furthermore, our operations are subject to unforeseen interruptions such as natural disasters, adverse weather and other events beyond our control. Motor fuels also have the potential to cause environmental damage if improperly handled or released. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses and/or curtailment of related operations because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage. We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. We may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and ability to make distributions to unitholders. We are relying on DMI to indemnify us for any costs or expenses that we incur for environmental liabilities and third-party claims, regardless of when a claim is made, that are based on environmental conditions in existence prior to the closing of the IPO at our Predecessors sites. To the extent escrow accounts, insurance and/or payments from DMI are not sufficient to cover any such costs or expenses, our business, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected. The Amended Omnibus Agreement provides that DMI must indemnify us for any costs or expenses that we incur for environmental liabilities and third-party claims, regardless of when a claim is made, that are based on environmental conditions in existence prior to the closing of the IPO at our Predecessors sites. DMI is the beneficiary of escrow accounts created to cover the cost to remediate certain environmental liabilities. In addition, DMI maintains insurance policies to cover environmental liabilities and/or, where available, participates in state programs that may also assist in funding the costs of environmental liabilities. There are certain sites that were acquired by us in connection with the IPO with existing environmental liabilities that are not covered by escrow accounts, state funds or insurance policies. As of December 31, 2014, DMI had an aggregate of approximately $2.2 million of environmental liabilities on sites acquired by us that are not covered by escrow accounts, state funds or insurance policies. To the extent escrow accounts, insurance and/or payments from DMI are not sufficient to cover any such costs or expenses, our business, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected. 25 Table of Contents Our wholesale motor fuel sales are generated under contracts that must be renegotiated or replaced periodically. If we are unable to successfully renegotiate or replace these contracts, then our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our wholesale motor fuel sales are generated under contracts that must be periodically renegotiated or replaced. As these contracts expire, they must be renegotiated or replaced. We may be unable to renegotiate or replace these contracts when they expire, and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace. Whether these contracts are successfully renegotiated or replaced is often times subject to factors beyond our control. Such factors include fluctuations in motor fuel prices, counterparty ability to pay for or accept the contracted volumes and a competitive marketplace for the services offered by us. If we cannot successfully renegotiate or replace our contracts or must renegotiate or replace them on less favorable terms, sales from these arrangements could decline and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the motor fuel that we distribute and sell. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications to the sale of commodities. Our business includes such commodities. Changes in product quality specifications, such as reduced sulfur content in refined petroleum products, or other more stringent requirements for fuels, could reduce our ability to procure product and our sales volume, require us to incur additional handling costs, and/or require the expenditure of capital. If we are unable to procure product or to recover these costs through increased sales, our ability to meet our financial obligations could be adversely affected. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial penalties. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection or operational safety that may require significant expenditures or result in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to underground storage tanks, the release or discharge of regulated materials into the air, water and soil, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to regulated materials, and the health and safety of our employees. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements; however, we cannot assure you that violations of these requirements will not occur in the future. We also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to legal actions brought by third parties for actual or alleged violations of or responsibility under environmental laws associated with releases of or exposure to motor fuel products. A violation of, liability under or compliance with these laws or regulations or any future environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Where releases of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels and crude oil have occurred, federal and state laws and regulations require that such releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The costs associated with the investigation and remediation of any such releases, as well as any associated third-party claims, could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. New, stricter environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating environmental matters. The trend in environmental regulation is towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Our business may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. However, there can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith. 26 Table of Contents We depend on transportation providers for the transportation of substantially all of our motor fuel. Thus, a change of providers or a significant change in our relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business. Substantially all of the motor fuel we distribute is transported from refineries to gas stations by third party carriers. A change of transportation providers, a disruption in service or a significant change in our relationship with these transportation carriers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. We rely heavily on our information technology systems to manage our business, and a disruption of these systems or an act of cyber-terrorism could adversely affect our business. We depend on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business transactions, in particular with respect to our cash management and disbursements, and provide analytical information to management. Our information systems are an essential component of our business, and a serious disruption to our information systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, cyber-security breaches or cyber-terrorism, and computer viruses. Any disruption could adversely affect our business. Any terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities and any global and domestic economic repercussions from terrorist activities and the governments response could adversely affect our business. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy infrastructure assets may be future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected our operations to increased risks. Terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities and any global and domestic economic repercussions from terrorist activities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. For instance, terrorist activity could lead to increased volatility in prices for motor fuels and other products we sell. Insurance carriers are currently required to offer coverage for terrorist activities as a result of the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which we refer to as TRIA. We purchased this coverage with respect to our property and casualty insurance programs, which resulted in additional insurance premiums. Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, TRIA has been extended through December 31, 2016. Although we cannot determine the future availability and cost of insurance coverage for terrorist acts, we do not expect the availability and cost of such insurance to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us CST controls us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future. Through its GP Purchase, effective October 1, 2014, CST controls the GP, including the election of directors; decisions regarding mergers, consolidations or acquisitions, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other matters affecting our capital structure; and other significant decisions that could impact our financial results and the amount of cash available for distribution. In addition, CST may compete directly with us for future acquisitions, which may conflict with our core strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders. As long as CST continues to own our General Partner, it will continue to be able to effectively control our decisions. CST controls our General Partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our General Partner and its affiliates, including CST, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders. CST owns and controls our General Partner and has the ability to appoint all of the directors of our General Partner. Although our General Partner has a legal duty to manage in good faith, the executive officers and directors of our General Partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our General Partner in a manner beneficial to its owner, CST. Furthermore, certain officers of our General Partner are directors or officers of affiliates of our General Partner. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and our unitholders, on the one hand, and our General Partner and CST, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our General Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of CST over our interests and the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:  our General Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as CST, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders; 27 Table of Contents  neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires CST to pursue a business strategy that favors us;  some officers of our General Partner who will provide services to us will devote time to affiliates of our General Partner and may be compensated for services rendered to such affiliate;  our partnership agreement limits the liability of and reduces fiduciary duties owed by our General Partner and also restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;  except in limited circumstances, our General Partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;  our General Partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the creation, reductions or increases of cash reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our unitholders, including distributions on our subordinated units, and to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, as well as the ability of the subordinated units to convert to common units;  our General Partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus. Such determination can affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders, including distributions on our subordinated units, and to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, as well as the ability of the subordinated units to convert to common units;  our General Partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units, to make incentive distributions or to accelerate the expiration of the subordination period;  our partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $15 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions on our subordinated units or the incentive distribution rights;  our partnership agreement does not restrict our General Partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf;  our General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;  our General Partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;  our General Partner controls the enforcement of obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us;  our General Partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us;  the holders of our incentive distribution rights may transfer their incentive distribution rights without unitholder approval; and  our General Partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to the holders of our incentive distribution rights in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to the incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner or the unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to the common unitholders in certain situations. The board of directors of our General Partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all. The board of directors of our General Partner has adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we intend to distribute quarterly an amount at least equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.4375 per unit on all of our units to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after the establishment of reserves and the payment of our expenses. However, the board may change such policy at any time at its discretion and could elect not to pay distributions for one or more quarters. In addition, our credit Facility includes certain restrictions on our ability to make distributions. 28 Table of Contents In addition, our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision. Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders. The amount of distributions we make, if any, and the decision to make any distribution at all will be determined by the board of directors of our General Partner, whose interests may differ from those of our common unitholders. Our General Partner has limited duties to our unitholders, which may permit it to favor its own interests or the interests of CST, to the detriment of our common unitholders. Neither we nor our General Partner have any employees and we rely solely on the employees of CST to manage our business. If our Amended Omnibus Agreement is terminated, we may not find suitable replacements to perform management services for us. Neither we nor our General Partner have any employees and we rely solely on CST to operate our assets. We and our General Partner have entered into an Amended Omnibus Agreement pursuant to which CST performs services for us and our General Partner, including the operation of our wholesale distribution and retail business and our properties. We are subject to the risk that our Amended Omnibus Agreement will be terminated and no suitable replacement will be found. The liability of DMI and CST is limited under our Amended Omnibus Agreement and we have agreed to indemnify DMI and CST against certain liabilities, which may expose us to significant expenses. The Amended Omnibus Agreement provides that we must indemnify DMI and CST for certain liabilities, including any liabilities incurred by CST attributable to the operating and administrative services provided to us under the agreement, other than liabilities resulting from DMIs or CSTs bad faith, fraud, or willful misconduct, as applicable. Our General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations. Our General Partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our General Partner or its assets. Our General Partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our General Partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our General Partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our General Partners fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our General Partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders. If we distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution to our partners, our ability to grow and make acquisitions could be limited. We may determine to distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, we expect to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. To the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, distributing a significant portion of our cash available for distribution may impair our ability to grow. In addition, if we distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their cash available for distribution to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement or our new credit agreement on our ability to issue additional units, provided there is no default under the credit agreement, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 29 Table of Contents There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue units ranking senior to the common units. In accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may issue additional partnership interests that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by us of units of senior rank may (i) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders; (ii) diminish the relative voting strength of the total common units outstanding as a class; or (iii) subordinate the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation. Our partnership agreement replaces our General Partners fiduciary duties to holders of our units. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards to which our General Partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our General Partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our General Partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our General Partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our General Partner may make in its individual capacity include:  how to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;  whether to exercise its call right;  whether to elect to reset target distribution levels; and  whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement. By purchasing a common unit, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above. Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our units for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement:  provides that whenever our General Partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our General Partner, our General Partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;  provides that our General Partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a General Partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning that it believed that the decision was in the best interest of our partnership;  provides that our General Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our General Partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and  provides that our General Partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its fiduciary duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is: (1) approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner, although our General Partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or (2) approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates. 30 Table of Contents In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our General Partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. Our General Partners affiliates may compete with us. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner will be restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our General Partner and those activities incidental to its ownership interest in us. Except as provided in the Amended Omnibus Agreement, affiliates of our General Partner are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. Pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our General Partner, CST or any of their affiliates, including their executive officers and directors. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our General Partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and our unitholders, on the one hand, and the affiliates of our General Partner and CST, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts, CST may favor their own interests over the interests of our unitholders. CST, as the holder of our incentive distribution rights, may elect to cause us to issue common units to the holders of our incentive distribution rights in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to the incentive distribution rights, without the approval of the conflicts committee of its board of directors or the holders of our common units. This could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units. CST, as the holder of our incentive distribution rights, has the right, at any time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and the holders of our incentive distribution rights have received incentive distributions at the highest level to which they are entitled (50%) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our distributions at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following such a reset election, the minimum quarterly distribution will be adjusted to equal the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution. If CST elects to reset the target distribution levels, it will be entitled to receive a number of common units. The number of common units to be issued to CST will equal the number of common units which would have entitled CST to an aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the prior quarter equal to the distributions to CST on the incentive distribution rights in the prior quarter. It is possible that, CST could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or expects to experience, declines in the cash distributions that CST receives related to the incentive distribution rights and may, therefore, desire to be issued common units rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. This risk could be elevated if our incentive distribution rights are transferred to another party. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that our common unitholders would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units to the holder of our incentive distribution rights in connection with resetting the target distribution levels. Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors, which could reduce the price at which the common units will trade. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence managements decisions regarding our business. Unitholders will have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our General Partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our General Partner, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by CST, as a result of its ownership of our General Partner, and not by our unitholders. Unlike publicly traded corporations, we will not conduct annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or conduct other matters routinely conducted at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. 31 Table of Contents Even if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they may not be able to remove our General Partner without the Topper Groups consent. If our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they will have limited ability to remove our General Partner. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2⁄3% of all outstanding common and subordinated units voting together as a single class is required to remove our General Partner. The Topper Group, including DMI, owns approximately 3.32% of our outstanding common units and 90.19% of our subordinated units, representing 30.04% of all currently outstanding units. Pursuant to a voting agreement, dated October 1, 2014, the Topper Group has agreed to vote such units in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors of CST or the Board of Directors of the General Partner, respectively. Also, if our General Partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and no units held by the holders of the subordinated units or their affiliates are voted in favor of that removal, all remaining subordinated units will automatically be converted into common units and any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished. Cause is narrowly defined in our partnership agreement to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding our General Partner liable for acting in bad faith, or in the case of a criminal matter, acting with knowledge that the conduct was criminal, in each case in its capacity as our General Partner. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business. Our General Partner interest or the control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our General Partner may transfer its General Partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of our General Partner to transfer its membership interests in our General Partner to a third party. The new members of our General Partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner with their own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner. This effectively permits a change of control without the vote or consent of the unitholders. Our General Partner has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price. If at any time our General Partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our General Partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of the common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by our General Partner or any of its affiliates for common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our General Partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our General Partner from issuing additional common units and exercising its call right. If our General Partner exercised its call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units were subsequently deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2014, the Topper Group, including DMI, owns approximately 3.32% of our outstanding common units and 90.19% of our subordinated units. At the end of the subordination period, assuming no additional issuances of units (other than upon the conversion of the subordinated units), the Topper Group, including DMI, will own 30.04% of our common units. The market price of our common units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public or private markets, including sales by the Topper Group, DMI or other large holders. As of February 20, 2015, we had 16,935,650 common units and 7,525,000 subordinated units outstanding. At the end of the subordination period, all of the subordinated units will convert into an equal number of common units. Sales by the Topper Group, DMI or other large holders of a substantial number of our common units in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities. In addition, we have agreed to provide registration rights to the Topper Group, including DMI. Under our partnership agreement and pursuant to a registration rights agreement that we have entered into, the Topper Group and DMI have registration rights relating to the offer and sale of any units that they hold, subject to certain limitations. 32 Table of Contents We may issue unlimited additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests. Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests, including limited partner interests that rank senior to the common units that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank could have the following effects:  our existing unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;  because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished;  the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation may be subordinated; and  the market price of the common units may decline. Our General Partners discretion in establishing cash reserves may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders. The partnership agreement requires our General Partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it determines are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures. The General Partner may reduce cash available for distribution by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders. Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units. Our partnership agreement restricts unitholders voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our General Partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our General Partner, cannot vote on any matter. Restrictions in our credit agreement could limit our ability to pay distributions upon the occurrence of certain events. Our payment of principal and interest on our debt will reduce cash available for distribution on our units. Our credit agreement will limit our ability to pay distributions upon the occurrence of the following events, among others:  failure to pay any principal when due or any interest, fees or other amounts when due;  failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct in any material respect;  failure to perform or otherwise comply with the covenants in our credit agreement or in other loan documents beyond the applicable notice and grace period;  any default in the performance of any obligation or condition beyond the applicable grace period relating to any other indebtedness of more than $7.5 million;  failure of the lenders to have a perfected first priority security interest in the collateral pledged by any loan party;  the entry of a judgment in excess of $20.0 million, to the extent any payments pursuant to the judgment are not covered by insurance;  a change in management or ownership control;  a violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA; and  a bankruptcy or insolvency event involving us or any of our subsidiaries. Any subsequent refinancing of our debt or any new debt could have similar restrictions. 33 Table of Contents Management fees and cost reimbursements due to our General Partner and CST for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our General Partner. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we will pay CST the management fee and reimburse our General Partner and CST for all out-of-pocket third-party expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us. In addition, pursuant to the Amended Omnibus Agreement, CST will be entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses that they incur on our behalf. Our partnership agreement does not limit the amount of expenses for which our General Partner and CST may be reimbursed. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees, if any, to our General Partner and CST will reduce the amount of cash available to pay distributions to our unitholders. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions and in certain circumstances may be personally liable for the obligations of the partnership. Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, or the Delaware Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. It may be determined that the right, or the exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group, to (i) remove or replace our General Partner, (ii) approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or (iii) take other action under our partnership agreement constitutes participation in the control of our business. A limited partner that participates in the control of our business within the meaning of the Delaware Act may be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of Delaware, to the same extent as our General Partner. This liability would extend to persons who transact business with us under the reasonable belief that the limited partner is a General Partner. Neither our partnership agreement nor the Delaware Act specifically provides for legal recourse against our General Partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our General Partner. The New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements. Our common units are listed on the NYSE. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our General Partners board of directors. Additionally, the NYSE does not require us as a publicly traded partnership to maintain a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders will not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Please read ManagementManagement of CrossAmerica Partners LP. An increase in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline and a significant increase in interest rates could adversely affect our ability to service our indebtedness. Like all equity investments, an investment in our common units is subject to certain risks. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, such variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make cash distributions. In exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments. Accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments such as publicly traded limited partnership interests. Reduced demand for our common units resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline. The interest rate on our credit agreement is variable; therefore, we have exposure to movements in interest rates. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely affect our ability to service our indebtedness. The increased cost could make the financing of our business activities more expensive. These added expenses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 34 Table of Contents Tax Risks Our tax treatment depends in large part on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our otherwise not being subject to a material amount of U.S. federal, state and local income or franchise tax. If the Internal Revenue Services, or IRS, were to treat us as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if we were to otherwise be subject to a material amount of additional entity level income, franchise or other taxation for U.S. federal, state or local tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. The anticipated after-tax benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A publicly traded partnership, such as us, may be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless 90% or more of its gross income for every taxable year it is publicly traded consists of qualifying income. Based on our current operations we believe that we will be able to satisfy this requirement and, thus, be able to be treated as a partnership, rather than a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, a change in our business, or a change in current law, could also cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity-level taxation. If we were required to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject to entity-level taxation, then we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate which, under current law, is a maximum of 35%. We would also likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as either a dividend (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits) and/or as taxable gain after recovery of a unitholders U.S. federal income tax basis in their units, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Because a U.S. federal income tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Thus, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. At the state level, were we to be subject to federal income tax, we would also be subject to the income tax provisions of many states. Moreover, because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to independently subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income taxes, franchise taxes and other forms of taxation. For example, we are required to pay Texas margin tax on our gross income apportioned to Texas. Imposition of any additional such taxes on us or an increase in the existing tax rates would reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that results in us becoming subject to either: (a) entity-level taxation for U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign income and/or withholding tax purposes to which we were not subject prior to such enactment, modification or interpretation, and/or (b) an increased amount of any such one or more of such taxes (including as a result of an increase in tax rates), then the minimum quarterly distribution amounts and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted (i.e., reduced) to reflect the impact of that law on us. We have a subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to entity-level U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax. We conduct a portion of our operations and business through one or more direct and indirect subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes (including LGWS). We may elect to conduct additional operations through these corporate subsidiaries in the future. These corporate subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level taxes, which reduce the cash available for distribution to us and, in turn, to unitholders. If the IRS were to successfully assert that these corporations have more tax liability than we anticipate or legislation were enacted that increased the corporate tax rate, our cash available for distribution to unit holders would be further reduced. 35 Table of Contents A significant amount of our income is attributable to our leasing of real property to LGO. If Lehigh Gas-Ohio Holdings LLC, or LGO Holdings, a Delaware limited liability company and the sole member of LGO, were to become related to us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the real property rents that we receive from LGO would no longer constitute qualifying income and we would likely be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A significant amount of our qualifying income is comprised of real property rents from LGO attributable to the sites that LGO leases from us. In general, any real property rents that we receive from a tenant or sub-tenant of ours in which we, directly or indirectly, own or are treated as owning by reason of the application of certain constructive ownership rules: (a) at least 10% of such tenants or sub-tenants stock (voting power or value) in the case where such tenant or sub-tenant is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (b) an interest of at least 10% of such tenants or sub-tenants assets or net profits in the case where such tenant or sub-tenant is not a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as would be the case with respect to LGO), would not constitute qualifying income. After applying certain constructive ownership rules, we will be treated as owning the 5% interest in the assets and net profits of LGO Holdings that Joseph V. Topper, Jr. actually and constructively owns. If we were considered to directly or indirectly own an interest of 10% or more of the assets or net profits of LGO Holdings, then the real property rents that we receive from LGO would no longer constitute qualifying income in which case, based on our current operations, we would likely no longer qualify to be treated as a partnership (and instead would be treated as a corporation) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our and LGO Holdings governing documents contain transfer restrictions designed to prevent us from being treated as directly or indirectly owning by reason of the application of constructive ownership rules an interest of 10% or more of LGO Holdings assets or net profits. We received an opinion of counsel at the closing of the IPO that transfer restrictions are generally enforceable under Delaware law, but a court could determine that these restrictions are inapplicable or unenforceable. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, the Obama administrations budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 recommends that certain publicly traded partnerships earning income from activities related to fossil fuels be taxed as corporations beginning in 2021. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. If successful, the Obama administrations proposal or other similar proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly-traded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. If the IRS contests the U.S. federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the costs of any contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We have not requested any ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any other U.S. federal income tax matter affecting us. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS, which will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our General Partner, will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution. Our unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of income from us even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. Our unitholders are required to pay U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local taxes, on their allocable share of our taxable income and gain even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax due with respect to that income. 36 Table of Contents Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected. If a unitholder sells common units, the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and that unitholders tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of a unitholders allocable share of our net taxable income result in a decrease in that unitholders tax basis in its common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units sold will, in effect, become taxable income to that unitholder, if that unitholder sells such units at a price greater than that unitholders tax basis in those units, even if the price received is less than the original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture of depreciation and amortization deductions and certain other items. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholders share of our non-recourse liabilities, if a unitholder sells units, that unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale. Tax-exempt organizations and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them. Investment in our common units by an organization that is exempt from U.S. federal income tax, such as employee benefit plans, individual retirement accounts (or IRAs), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, a substantial amount of our U.S. federal taxable income and gain constitute gross income from an unrelated trade or business and the amount thereof allocable to a tax-exempt organization would be taxable to such organization as unrelated business taxable income. Distributions to a non-U.S. person that holds our common units will be reduced by U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed at the highest applicable U.S. federal income tax rate and such non-U.S. person will be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and pay U.S. federal income tax, to the extent not previously withheld, on his, her or its allocable share of our taxable income and gain. Any tax-exempt organization or a non-U.S. person should consult its tax advisor before investing in our common units. Our unitholders are subject to state and local income taxes and return filing requirements in states and localities where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, such as foreign, state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We currently conduct business in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Tennessee, Georgia, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Maine, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Texas, Delaware and Virginia. Each of these states (other than Florida and Texas) currently imposes a personal income tax on individuals (except that Tennessee only imposes a personal income tax on interest and dividends and New Hampshire only imposes a personal income tax on interest, dividends and gambling winnings) as well as an income, business profits and/or a franchise tax on corporations and other entities. We may own property or conduct business in other states, localities or foreign countries in the future. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state, local or non U.S. tax consequences of an investment in our common units. We will treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of U.S. federal income tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes from any sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to a unitholders U.S. federal income tax returns. 37 Table of Contents We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and allocate them, between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first business day of each month and as of the opening of the applicable exchange on which our common units are listed, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders. We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations and although the U.S. Treasury Department issued proposed Treasury Regulations allowing a similar monthly simplifying convention, such regulations are not final and do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our proration method or new Treasury Regulations were to be issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders. If a unitholder loans their common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, they may be considered to have disposed of those common units for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and they may recognize gain or loss from such deemed disposition. During the period of the loan of common units to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to such common units may not be reportable by the respective unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable to them as ordinary income. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion regarding the treatment of a unitholder where common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units. Thus, unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax effect of loaning their common units to a short seller. We have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between our General Partner and the unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. When we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, our General Partner will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our General Partner. Although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, including the valuation of our assets, our General Partner will make many of the fair market value determinations of our assets using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets. Our methodology may be viewed as understating or overstating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our General Partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between our General Partner and certain of our unitholders. A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income, gain or loss being allocated to our unitholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It also could affect the amount of taxable gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders U.S. federal income tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions. 38 Table of Contents The sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We will be considered to have technically terminated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether a technical tax termination has occurred, a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits could occur if, for example, the Topper Group, which will own collectively 50% or more of the total interest in our capital and profits at the time of the IPO, were to sell or exchange their collective interest in us within a period of twelve months. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which could result in us filing two U.S. federal income tax returns (and unitholders receiving two Schedule K-1s) for one calendar year. However, pursuant to an IRS relief procedure the IRS may allow, among other things, a constructively terminated partnership to provide a single Schedule K-1 for the calendar year in which a termination occurs. Our technical termination could also result in the re-starting of the recovery period for our assets (and, thus, result in a significant deferral of depreciation and amortization deductions allowable in computing our U.S. federal taxable income). In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination. Our technical termination, however, would not affect our classification as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes but instead we would be treated as a new partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we were treated as a new partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we were unable to determine that a technical termination occurred.
