Railroad operators typically require substantial land use rights for track, freight and maintenance yards, stations and related facilities. The availability of convenient rail transportation generally enhances the value of land along a rail line. We have not engaged and do not have any current plans to engage in commercial development of any of our land use rights for use other than in connection with our existing businesses. We do not at present intend to contribute capital to engage in any land development projects in the future. However, we may contribute land use rights not otherwise being fully utilized by us for equity stakes in these projects if we believe these opportunities are economically viable. Any development projects will require approval from PRC government authorities responsible for regulating land development. As of April 26, 2011, we had 48 stations situated on our rail line, of which the Guangzhou East Station is the largest, occupying an area of 402,438 square meters.
