ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our short- and long-term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control. Stockholders and prospective stockholders in the Company should consider carefully the following risk factors, in addition to the information contained in this report. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth below. Implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will be expensive, time-consuming and require significant management attention, and may not be successful. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company will be required, beginning in its fiscal year 2008, to perform an evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting and have its independent registered public accounting firm test and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of such internal controls and publicly attest to such evaluation. The implementation process of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will be expensive, time-consuming and will require significant attention of the Companys management. The Company cannot assure that it will not discover material weaknesses in its internal controls. The Company also cannot assure that it will complete the process of its evaluation and the auditors attestation on time. If the Company discovers a material weakness, corrective action may be time-consuming, costly and further divert the attention of management. The disclosure of a material weakness, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the markets confidence in the Companys financial statements, cause the delisting of its Common Stock from Nasdaq and harm its stock price, especially if a restatement of financial statements for past periods were to be necessary. A downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which would reduce our net sales. The retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variations. The merchandise sold by us is generally a discretionary expense for our customers. A recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits has had, and in the future may have, a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Terrorist attacks or acts of war may harm our business. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, information systems, vendors and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause us to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict. Our geographical focus in California, Nevada and Arizona may make us more vulnerable to such uncertainties than other comparable retailers who may not have similar geographical concentration. Intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability. The sporting goods business and the retail environment are highly competitive, and we compete with national, regional and local full-line sporting goods chains, specialty stores, supplier owned stores, discount and department stores, and internet retailers. A number of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Because our stores are concentrated in the western portion of the United States, we are subject to regional risks. Currently, most of our stores are located in Southern California and the balance is located in Northern California, Central California, Nevada and Arizona. Accordingly, we are subject to regional risks, such as the economy, weather conditions, natural disasters and government regulations. For example, 7 Table of Contents warm winter weather in the resorts frequented by our customers has affected sales in the past. When the region suffers an economic downturn or when other adverse events occur, historically there has been an adverse effect on our sales and profitability and this could also affect our ability to implement our planned growth. In addition, many of our vendors rely on the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to process our shipments. Any disruption or congestion at the ports could impair our ability to adequately stock our stores. Several of our competitors operate stores across the United States and, thus, are not as vulnerable to such regional risks. We rely on one distribution center and any disruption could reduce our sales. We currently rely on a single distribution center in Ontario, California. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this distribution center due to fire, earthquake or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair both our ability to adequately stock our stores and our sales and profitability. Our ability to expand our business will be dependent upon our ability to meet challenges in new markets. Our continued growth depends on a strategy of opening new, profitable stores in existing markets and in new regional markets. The ability to successfully implement this growth strategy could be negatively affected by any of the following:  suitable sites may not be available for leasing;  we may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease terms;  we might not be able to hire and retain qualified store personnel; and  we might not have the financial resources necessary to fund our expansion plans. In addition, our expansion in new and existing markets may present competitive, distribution and merchandising challenges that differ from the current challenges. These potential new challenges include competition among our stores, added strain on our distribution center, additional information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from ongoing operations. We face additional challenges in entering new markets, including consumers lack of awareness of the Company, difficulties in hiring personnel and problems due to our unfamiliarity with local real estate markets and demographics. New markets may also have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. To the extent that we are not able to meet these new challenges, sales could decrease and operating costs could increase. Furthermore, a decline in our overall financial performance, increased rents or any other adverse effects arising from the commercial real estate market in our geographical markets may adversely affect our current growth plan. There can be no assurance that we will possess sufficient funds to finance the expenditures related to our planned growth, that new stores can be opened on a timely basis, that such new stores can be operated on a profitable basis, or that such growth will be manageable. We may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general store operating procedures. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, our business could suffer. In addition, the integration of any acquired business, and their financial results, into ours may adversely affect our operating results. We currently do not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions. Our future growth will be dependent on the availability of additional financing. We may not be able to fund our future growth or react to competitive pressures if we lack sufficient funds. Unexpected conditions could cause us to be in violation of our lenders operating 8 Table of Contents covenants. Currently, we believe we have sufficient cash available through our bank credit facilities and cash from operations to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future if necessary. If we are unable to successfully implement our controlled growth strategy or manage our growing business, our future operating results could suffer. Since our inception, we have experienced periods of rapid growth. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in maintaining or increasing our sales in the future. Any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on our management, management information systems, inventory management, distribution facilities and receivables management. Any failure to timely enhance our operating systems, or unexpected difficulties in implementing such enhancements, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain talent, our operating results could suffer. We depend on the continued service of our senior management. The loss of the services of any key employee could hurt our business. Also, our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and motivate other highly skilled personnel. Failure to do so may adversely affect future results. Seasonal fluctuations in the sales of sporting goods could cause our annual operating results to suffer. Our sales volume increases significantly during the Holiday season as is typical with other sporting goods retailers. In addition, our product mix has historically emphasized cold weather sporting goods increasing the seasonality of our business. In recent years, the months of November, December and January represented between 30% and 34% of our total net sales, while winter-related products ranged from 15% to 19% of total net sales. The operating results historically have been influenced by the amount and timing of snowfall at the resorts frequented by our customers. An early snowfall often has influenced sales because it generally extends the demand for winter apparel and equipment, while a late snowfall may have the opposite effect. Suppliers in the ski and snowboard industry require us to make commitments for purchases of apparel and equipment by April for fall delivery, and only limited quantities of merchandise can be reordered during the fall. Consequently, we place our orders in the spring anticipating snowfall in the winter. If the snowfall does not at least provide an adequate base or occurs late in the season, or if sales do not meet projections, we may be required to mark down our winter apparel and equipment. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially, which may adversely affect our business. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, a substantial variation in our net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending, changing consumer demands, the timing of our introduction of new products, the level of consumer acceptance of each new product, the seasonality of the markets in which we participate, the weather and actions of competitors. Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful, and our results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future performance. We are controlled by our Founder and management, whose interests may differ from other stockholders. At June 12, 2006, Norbert Olberz, the Companys Chairman Emeritus, director and founder, Craig Levra, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Howard Kaminsky, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, collectively owned approximately 67% of the Companys outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock. Messrs. Olberz, Levra and Kaminsky effectively have the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, the election and removal of directors, and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Companys 9 Table of Contents assets, and to control the Companys management and affairs. Transactions may be pursued that could enhance Messrs. Olberz, Levra and Kaminskys interests in the Company while involving risks to the interests of the Companys other stockholders, and there is no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of the Companys other stockholders. Problems with our information systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial results. Our success, in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels and our centralized distribution system, largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at the store level, replenish inventory from our warehouse, and aggregate daily sales information among other things. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:  earthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters;  power loss, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failure, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic loss of data and similar events; and  computer viruses, penetration by hackers seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other breaches of security. We seek to minimize these risks by the use of backup facilities and redundant systems. Nevertheless any failure that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales. If we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand, we may lose customers and our sales may decline. If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, we may experience lower net sales, higher inventory markdowns and lower margins. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty. These preferences are also subject to change. Sporting goods are often subject to short-lived trends, such as the short-lived popularity of in-line scooters. Outdoor wear is significantly influenced by fashion. Our success depends upon the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to trends in sporting goods merchandise and consumers participation in sports. Failure to identify and respond to these changes may cause net sales to decline. In addition, because we generally make commitments to purchase products from vendors up to nine months in advance of the proposed delivery, misjudging the market may over-stock unpopular products and force inventory markdowns that could have a negative impact on profitability, or have insufficient inventory of a popular item that can be sold at full markup. The price of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may be volatile. Our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are thinly traded making it difficult to sell large amounts. The market prices of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as quarterly variations in operating results, operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, changes in financial estimates, changes in market valuations of competitors, announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature, additions or departures of key personnel, future sales of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and stock volume fluctuations. Also, general political and economic conditions such as a recession or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Provisions in the Companys charter documents could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. At June12, 2006, Norbert Olberz, the Companys Chairman Emeritus, director and founder, Craig Levra, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Howard Kaminsky, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, collectively owned approximately 67% of the Companys outstanding Class A and 10 Table of Contents Class B Common Stock. The holder of a share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented to the stockholders whereas the holder of a share of Class A Common Stock has 1/20th of one vote on each matter presented to the stockholders. Subject to the Class A protection provisions described below, Messrs. Olberz, Levra and Kaminsky will be able to sell shares of Class A Common Stock and use the proceeds to purchase additional shares of Class B Common Stock, thereby increasing their collective voting power. Subject to the prohibition on the grant, issuance, sale or transfer of Class B Common Stock to Messrs. Levra and Kaminsky, the Company will also be able to issue Class B Common Stock (subject to the applicable rules of the NASD and the availability of authorized and unissued shares of Class B Common Stock) to persons deemed by the Board of Directors to be preferable to a potential acquirer, thereby diluting the voting power of that potential acquirer. The Class A protection provisions in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation could also make acquisition of voting control more expensive by requiring an acquirer of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock to purchase a corresponding proportion of Class A Common Stock. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation contains certain other provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting and, accordingly, a significant minority stockholder could not necessarily elect any designee to the Board of Directors. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation also provides that the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, which are elected for staggered three-year terms and, accordingly, it could take at least two annual meetings to change a majority of the Board of Directors. As a result of these provisions in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, stockholders of the Company may be deprived of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and it would be more difficult to replace the directors and management of the Company. We may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. We may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that we sell. We may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage. In addition, we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our comparable store sales will fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance. Changes in our comparable store sales results could affect the price of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable store sales results, including: competition, our new store openings and remodeling, general regional and national economic conditions, actions taken by our competitors, consumer trends and preferences, changes in the shopping centers in which we are located, new product introductions and changes in our product mix, timing and effectiveness of promotional events, lack of new product introductions to spur growth in the sale of various kinds of sports equipment, and weather. Our comparable store sales may vary from quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store sales may cause the price of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to fluctuate significantly.
