Service and Other  The Company also generates sales from its Customer Service organization through maintenance contracts, spare part sales, customer training and sales of other products and valued-added services. (See Technical Support, Installation and Service below.) CUSTOMERS, MARKETING, AND SALES The Companys products are used extensively in the Environmental, Industrial and Life Science markets using chromatography and extraction technologies. The Environmental market is characterized by water analysis, safety and security applications and pollution testing, with chemists from private and governmental laboratories being the Companys primary customers in this field. The Industrial segments comprise the electronics and power industries which a demand for analyzing the higher purity water quality in their production facilities. Furthermore, the Company serves a number of the largest industrial companies worldwide within the chemical industry segment, which produce specialty chemicals, petrochemicals, consumer products and more, and the food and beverage 8 Table of Contents segment, which test for product quality assurance. The Life Science markets Dionex serves include the pharmaceutical segment, biosciences and medical sciences with customers from industrial, academic and governmental accounts. One of the Companys marketing strategies is to target all market segments mentioned above where Dionex technology is already established. Here, the Company seeks to increase demand for its chromatography solutions by approaching all existing and potential customers through direct marketing activities including direct sales calls, mailings, advertising, electronic marketing, seminars, and workshops. In addition, the Company builds visibility and branding for the Companys global presence through scientific conferences and exhibitions. Continuous growth in all these markets results from identifying new customers in existing sales regions, extending geographic penetration and increasing demand for the Companys products and technical support capabilities. The second component of the Companys marketing strategy is to explore and develop new application fields in close collaboration with existing and potential customers, and to leverage this competence into other market areas. A prerequisite to establish this process is the availability of highly skilled technical developing and support staff working to also assist customers in solution definition and development. To meet and exceed customer expectations in the Companys developing commercial markets, the Companys effort is to optimize and diversify its technology interests in the chromatography market, including sample preparation, purification, analysis, testing, and data management. Geographically, the Company currently markets and distributes its products and services through its own sales force in Austria, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. In each of these countries, the Company maintains one or more local sales offices in order to support and service the Company customers in the regions. Sales to customers by geographic region were approximately 31% in North America, 42% in Europe, and 27% in Asia/Pacific and other of net sales in fiscal 2006 and 2005. The United States accounts for the largest portion of the Companys overall revenues followed by Germany and Japan, respectively. In other international locations where it does not have a direct sales force, the Company has developed a network of distributors and sales agents. The Company manufactures its products based upon its forecast of customer demand and maintains adequate inventories of completed modules or finished goods in advance of receipt of firm orders. System or instrument orders are generally placed by the customer on an as-needed basis, and instruments are usually shipped within four to six weeks after receipt of an order. The Company does not maintain a substantial backlog, and backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of the Companys actual sales in any succeeding period. The level of backlog at June 30, 2006 was $46.9 million and at June 30, 2005 was $41.0 million. COMPETITION Competition in the Companys industry is based upon the performance capabilities of the analytical instruments, technical support and after-market services, the manufacturers reputation as a technological leader and selling prices. Management believes that performance capabilities are the most important of these criteria. Customers measure system performance based on sensitivity (the ability to discern minute quantities of a particular sample component), selectivity (the ability to distinguish between similar components), speed and throughput of analysis, and the range of chemical and biological samples the system can effectively analyze. Management believes that the Company enjoys a favorable reputation in terms of performance capabilities, technical support and service. Companies competing with Dionex in the analytical instruments market include Agilent Technologies, Inc., Waters Corporation, Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Corporation, Varian, Inc., Perkin-Elmer, Inc. and Metrohm Ltd. The Company believes no single competitor has a dominant position in the analytical instruments market. The Company believes it has a substantial market share in a segment of the liquid chromatography (LC) market, the ion chromatography (IC) segment. Dionex IC systems generally compete with a number of analytical techniques used in identifying and quantifying ionic and polar compounds. The primary source of competition are conventional manual and automated wet chemistry procedures and certain possibly modified liquid chromatography systems using a single column method without or including a ion suppression device. Companies 9 Table of Contents competing with Dionex in IC include such vendors as W.R. Grace Alltech, Metrohm AG, Shimadzu Corporation, Waters Corporation and other smaller companies. The Company believes it has a smaller but rapidly growing market share in the HPLC and capillary-/nano-LC markets. The Companys UltiMate 3000 systems compete directly with other manufacturers HPLC systems in traditional and capillary-/nano-HPLC applications. The Company believes that the UltiMate HPLC system has certain benefits over competing systems, including advanced pump and dual pump technology, thermostatted temperature control, high performance auto sampling capabilities, all technologies designed for intelligent LC (LCi). In addition, UltiMate 3000 offers many benefits over competing systems including the ability to analyze minute contents of sample at very low flow rates. The Company also believes that its CHROMELEON software package not only provides competitive advantages over its competitors software offerings but is respected as the most advanced chromatography data management system in the market. Competitors of the Company in the HPLC market include such vendors as Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Electron Corporation, Varian, Inc., Waters Corporation and various smaller companies. The Companys Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) series compete directly with standard Soxhlet, sonication, supercritical fluid extraction and microwave extraction techniques provided by other companies. Management believes that its ASE systems have certain benefits compared to competing techniques, including faster extraction time, reduced solvent usage, built-in automation, and ease of use. PATENTS AND LICENSES The Company has a patent portfolio covering certain technologies of the Companys products. The Companys patents are presently issued to the United States and number of foreign countries. As a matter of Company policy, the Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on developments that it regards as strategic, material and patentable. The Companys patents, including those licensed from others, expire on various dates through 2022. The Company believes that, while its patent portfolio has value, no single patent or patent application is in itself essential and that the invalidity or expiration of any single patent would not have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company regards its CHROMELEON software as proprietary and relies on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and other proprietary rights, laws, license agreements and other restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title to protect its rights to its software products. The Company has no patents covering its software, and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the Companys proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales is provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found elsewhere in this report. The Company has subsidiaries in Austria, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States.

There can be no assurances that the Companys product development efforts will be successful or that the products developed will be accepted by the marketplace. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. The continuation or spread of the current economic uncertainty in key markets would likely harm the Companys operating results. The Company sells its products in many geographical regions throughout the world. If economic conditions in any of these regions decline or continue to decline, the demand for the Companys products is likely to be reduced. An economic downturn in any of the Companys major markets would likely harm the Companys results of operations. Foreign currency fluctuations and other risks related to international operations may adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company derived approximately 72% of its net sales from outside the United States in fiscal 2006 and expects to continue to derive the majority of net sales from outside the United States for the foreseeable future. Most of the Companys sales outside the United States are denominated in the local currency of its customers. As a result, the U.S. dollar value of the Companys net sales varies with currency rate fluctuations. Significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. In recent periods, the Companys results of operations have been negatively affected from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the Japanese yen and other foreign currencies. Tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in political environments, interruptions in overseas shipments and changes in tax laws may also impact international sales negatively. Fluctuations in worldwide demand for analytical instrumentation could affect the Companys operating results. The demand for analytical instrumentation products can fluctuate depending upon capital expenditure cycles. Most companies consider the Companys instrumentation products capital equipment and some customers may be unable to secure the necessary capital expenditure approvals due to general economic or customer specific conditions. Significant fluctuations in demand could harm the Companys results of operations. Fluctuations in the Companys quarterly operating results may cause the Companys stock price to decline. A high proportion of the Companys costs are fixed due in part to the Companys significant sales, research and product development and manufacturing costs. Declines in revenue caused by fluctuations in currency rates, worldwide demand for analytical instrumentation or other factors could disproportionately affect the Companys quarterly operating results, which may in turn cause the Companys stock price to decline. The Companys results of operations and financial condition will suffer if the Company does not introduce new products that are attractive to its customers on a timely basis. The Companys products are highly technical in nature. As a result, many of the Companys products must be developed months or even years in advance of the potential need by a customer. If the Company fails to introduce new products and enhancements as demand arises or in advance of the competition, the Companys products are likely to become obsolete over time, which would harm operating results. Also, if the market is not receptive to the Companys newly developed products, the Company may be unable to recover costs of research and product development and marketing, and may fail to achieve material components of its business plan. 12 Table of Contents The analytical instrument market is highly competitive, and the Companys inability to compete effectively in this market would adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The analytical instrumentation market is highly competitive and the Company competes with many companies on a local and international level that are significantly larger than Dionex and have greater resources, including larger sales forces and technical staff. Competitors may introduce more effective and less costly products and, in doing so, may make it difficult for the Company to acquire and retain customers. If this occurs, the Companys market share may decline and operating results could suffer. The Company may experience difficulties with obtaining components from sole- or limited-source suppliers, or manufacturing delays, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations. Most raw materials, components and supplies that the Company purchases are available from many suppliers. However, certain items are purchased from sole or limited-source suppliers and a disruption of these sources could adversely affect the Companys ability to ship products as needed. A prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components would likely reduce product inventory, hinder sales and harm the Companys reputation with customers. Worldwide demand for certain components may cause the cost of such components to rise or limit the availability of these components, which could have an adverse affect on the Companys results of operations. The Company manufactures products in its facilities in Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. Any prolonged disruption to the operations at these facilities, whether due to labor unrest, supplier issues, damage to the physical plants or equipment or other reasons, could also adversely affect the Companys results of operations. The Companys executive officers and other key employees are critical to the Companys business, they may not remain with the Company, in the future and finding talented replacements would be difficult. The operations of Dionex require managerial and technical expertise. Each of the executive officers and key employees located in the United States is employed at will and may leave the employment of the Company at any time. In addition, the Company operates in a variety of locations around the world where the demand for qualified personnel may be extremely high and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. As a result, competition for personnel can be intense and the turnover rate for qualified personnel may be high. The loss of any of the Companys executive officers or key employees could cause the Company to incur increased operating expenses and divert senior management resources in searching for replacements. An inability to hire, train and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees would seriously affect the Companys ability to conduct its business. The success of Dionexs business is dependent in part on protection of proprietary information and inventions. Obtaining and protecting the Companys proprietary products, processes and technologies can be difficult and expensive. Patent and trade secret protection is important to the Company because developing new technologies and products is time-consuming and expensive. The Company owns many U.S. and foreign patents and intends to apply for additional patents to cover its technology and products. The Company may be unable to obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications that it owns. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect the Companys technology. Third parties may seek to challenge, circumvent or invalidate issued patents that the Company owns. In addition to patents, the Company has unpatented proprietary products and know-how. The measures employed by the Company to protect this technology, such as maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary information and relying on trade secret laws, may be inadequate. The Company may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect its proprietary rights. 13 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY The following table lists the names and positions of all current executive officers of the Company, and their ages as of September 11, 2006.
