ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Us and Our Business Our Chemical and Climate Control Businesses and their customers are sensitive to adverse economic cycles. Our Chemical Business can be affected by cyclical factors such as inflation, global energy policy and costs, global market conditions and economic downturns in specific industries. Certain sales of our Chemical Business are sensitive to the level of activity in the agricultural, mining, automotive and housing industries. A substantial decline in the activity of our Chemical Business has in the past, and could in the future, have a material adverse effect on the results of our Chemical Business and on our liquidity and capital resources. Further, material economic changes that adversely affect our natural gas working interests or lower natural gas prices may require us to write down the carrying value of our natural gas working interests. Therefore, these changes in our Chemical Business could adversely impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. Our Climate Control Business also can be affected by cyclical factors, such as interest rates, inflation and economic downturns. Our Climate Control Business depends on sales to customers in the construction and renovation industries, which are particularly sensitive to these factors. A decline in the economic activity in the U.S. has in the past, and could in the future, have a material adverse effect on us and our customers in the construction and renovation industries in which our Climate Control Business sells a substantial amount of its products. Such a decline could result in a decrease in revenues and profits, and an increase in bad debts that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Weather conditions adversely affect our Chemical Business. The agricultural products produced and sold by our Chemical Business have been in the past, and could be in the future, materially affected by adverse weather conditions (such as excessive rain or drought) in the primary markets for our fertilizer and related agricultural products. If any of these unusual weather events occur during the primary seasons for sales of our agricultural products (March-June and September-November), this could have a material adverse effect on the agricultural sales of our Chemical Business and our financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, and natural disasters (such as hurricanes, pandemic health crisis, etc.), have and could negatively impact U.S. and foreign companies, the financial markets, the industries where we operate, our operations and profitability. Terrorist attacks and natural disasters (such as hurricanes) have in the past, and can in the future, negatively affect our operations. We cannot predict further terrorist attacks and natural disasters in the U.S. and elsewhere. These attacks or natural disasters have contributed to economic instability in the U.S. and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence, war or natural disasters could further affect the industries where we operate, our ability to purchase raw materials, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters may directly impact our physical facilities, especially our chemical facilities, or those of our suppliers or customers and could impact our sales, our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers. In the past, hurricanes affecting the Gulf Coast of the U.S. have negatively impacted our operations and those of our customers. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities or natural disasters are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations. 14 Table of Contents Despite continuing investment to upgrade and replace equipment on an ongoing basis, the age of facilities of our Chemical Business increases the risk for unplanned downtime which may be significant. Our Chemical Business is comprised of operating units of various ages and levels of automated control. While we have continued to make significant annual capital improvements, potential age or control related issues have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, which could cause damage to the equipment and ancillary facilities. The equipment required for the manufacture of our chemical products is specialized, and the time for replacement of such equipment can be lengthy, resulting in extended downtime in the affected unit. Although we utilize various reliability and inspection programs and maintain a significant inventory of spare equipment, which are intended to mitigate the extent of production losses, unplanned outages may still occur. As a result, these unplanned downtime events at our chemical facilities have in the past and could in the future adversely impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. An explosion and equipment failures at certain of our chemical facilities will result in substantial expenditures for repair and/or replacement of damaged equipment. During 2012, certain of our chemical facilities sustained substantial damage due to an explosion and equipment failures, which we anticipate will require substantial expenditures by us to repair and/or replace. Although we believe we will be able to recover under our property insurance policy a portion of the cost and expense to repair and/or replace the damaged equipment as a result of those occurrences, the total amount that we will recover under our property insurance is currently unknown. The inability to recover under our property insurance policies a material amount of the cost to repair and/or replace the damaged equipment may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. Future legislative or regulatory changes impacting our Chemical Business may result in increased costs and decreased revenues, cash flows and liquidity. Our businesses are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, primarily relating to our Chemical Business. The manufacture and distribution of chemical products are activities, which entail environmental risks and impose obligations under environmental laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations. Although we believe we have established processes to monitor, review and manage our businesses to comply with the numerous environmental laws and regulations, our Chemical Business has in the past, and may in the future, be subject to fines, penalties and sanctions for violations and substantial expenditures for cleanup costs and other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of effluents at or from the Chemical Business facilities. Further, a number of our Chemical Business facilities are dependent on environmental permits to operate, the loss or modification of which could have a material adverse effect on their operations and our financial condition. Changes to the production equipment at our chemical facilities as may be required in order to comply with environmental regulations may require substantial capital expenditures. In summary, new or changed laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. We may be required to expand our security procedures and install additional security equipment for our Chemical Business in order to comply with current and possible future government regulations, including applicable security regulations. The chemical industry in general, and producers and distributors of anhydrous ammonia and AN specifically, are scrutinized by the government, industry and public on security issues. Under current and proposed regulations, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs relating to security at our chemical facilities and distribution centers, as well as in the transportation of our products. These costs could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The cost of such regulatory changes, if significant enough, could lead some of our customers to choose alternate products to anhydrous ammonia and AN, which would have a significant impact on our Chemical Business. 15 Table of Contents In order to comply with the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007 as enacted by the United States Congress, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has published in the August 3, 2011 Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This regulation proposes to require sellers, buyers, their agents and transporters of solid AN and certain solid mixtures containing AN to possess a valid registration issued by DHS, keep certain records, report the theft or unexplained loss of regulated materials and certain other new requirements. We and other parties affected by this proposal have submitted appropriate comments to DHS regarding the proposed regulation. Depending on the provisions of the final regulation to be promulgated by DHS and on our ability to pass these costs to our customers, these requirements may have a negative effect on the profitability of our AN business and may result in fewer distributors who are willing to handle the product. Proposed governmental laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions may subject certain of our Chemical Business facilities to significant new costs and restrictions on their operations. The manufacturing facilities within our Chemical Business use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other raw materials necessary for the production of their chemical products that result, or could result, in certain greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. Federal and state courts and administrative agencies, including the EPA, are considering the scope and scale of greenhouse gas emission regulation. Legislation is being considered that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions at some point in the future. The EPA has instituted a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirement that began in 2010, which impacts all of our chemical manufacturing sites. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity and other energy sources purchased by our chemical facilities; increase costs for natural gas and other raw materials (such as anhydrous ammonia); potentially restrict access to or the use of certain raw materials necessary to produce our chemical products; and require us to incur substantial expenditures to retrofit our chemical facilities to comply with the proposed new laws and regulations regulating greenhouse gas emissions, if adopted. Federal, state and local governments may also pass laws mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may increase the cost of energy use in certain of our chemical and other manufacturing operations. As it relates to our Chemical Business working interest in natural gas properties, legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require our Chemical Business to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas that the operator of these wells intends to sell. While future emission regulations or new laws appear possible, it is too early to predict how these regulations, if and when adopted, will affect our businesses, operations, liquidity or financial results. There is intense competition in the Climate Control and Chemical industries. Substantially all of the markets in which we participate are highly competitive with respect to product quality, price, design innovations, distribution, service, warranties, reliability and efficiency. We compete with a number of companies, domestic and foreign, that have greater financial, marketing and other resources. Competitive factors could require us to reduce prices or increase spending on product development, marketing and sales that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. A substantial portion of our sales is dependent upon a limited number of customers. For 2012, six customers of our Chemical Business accounted for approximately 53% of its net sales and 33% of our consolidated sales, and our Climate Control Business had one customer (including affiliates and their distributors) that accounted for approximately 18% of its net sales and 6% of our consolidated sales. The loss of, or a material reduction in purchase levels by, one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if we are unable to replace a customer on substantially similar terms. Cost and the lack of availability of raw materials could materially affect our profitability and liquidity. Our sales and profits are heavily affected by the costs and availability of primary raw materials. These primary raw materials are subject to considerable price volatility. Historically, when there have been rapid increases in the cost of these primary raw materials, we have sometimes been unable to timely increase our sales prices to cover all of the higher costs incurred. While we periodically enter into futures/forward contracts to economically hedge against price increases in certain of these raw materials, there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage against price fluctuations in those raw materials. Anhydrous ammonia and natural gas represent the primary raw material feedstocks in the production of most of the products of the Chemical Business. Although our Chemical Business enters into contracts with certain customers that provide for the pass-through of raw material costs, we have a substantial amount of sales that do not provide for the pass-through of raw material costs. In addition, the Climate Control Business depends on raw materials such as copper and steel, which have shown considerable price volatility. As a result, in the future, we may not be able to pass along to all of our customers the full amount of any increases in raw material costs. There can be no assurance that future price fluctuations in our raw materials will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 16 Table of Contents As stated above, natural gas represents one of the primary raw materials in the production of our Chemical Business products, and, as a result, we acquired natural gas working interests as an economic hedge against rising prices for natural gas. It is possible that we may not be able to use our natural gas working interests as an economic hedge under certain limited conditions. We do not operate our natural gas working interest properties and have no, or very limited, ability to exercise influence over operations of these properties or their associated cost. Since we source certain of our raw materials and components on a global basis, we may experience long lead times in procuring those raw materials and components purchased overseas, as well as being subject to tariff controls and other international trade barriers, which may increase the uncertainty of raw material and component availability and pricing volatility. Additionally, we depend on certain vendors to deliver the primary raw materials and other key components that are required in the production of our products. Any disruption in the supply of the primary raw materials and other key components could result in lost production or delayed shipments. We have suspended in the past, and could suspend in the future, production at our chemical facilities due to, among other things, the high cost or lack of availability of such primary raw materials, which could adversely impact our competitiveness in the markets we serve. Accordingly, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially affected in the future by the lack of availability of primary raw materials and other key components and increase costs relating to the purchase of raw materials or the production of our natural gas working interests. Potential increase of imported ammonium nitrate. Prior to March 2011, U.S. imports of fertilizer grade AN from Russia were controlled by the terms of an antidumping Suspension Agreement under which maximum volumes and minimum prices were set for Russian AN imports. In March 2011, the Russian Federation notified the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce Department) that it had decided to withdraw from the Suspension Agreement. Accordingly, the Agreement terminated effective May 2, 2011. As of that date, Russian AN imports have been subject to an antidumping duty order (Russian Order). The Russian Order, unlike the Suspension Agreement, does not place any volume restrictions on Russian AN imports and does not ensure that Russian prices are tied to the prevailing U.S. market price. Instead, the Russian Order requires that Russian AN be priced fairly, as defined by comparisons with Russian home market or third country AN prices or based on Russian production costs. Because Russian producers continue to benefit from natural gas supplied to them at state-set prices that are below market value, and because natural gas is by far the largest material input into the production of AN, depending upon the analysis and methodologies used by the Commerce Department, the price of Russian AN exported to the U.S. may be below prevailing U.S. market prices and below our cost to produce fertilizer grade AN. Under the Russian Order, every shipment of Russian fertilizer grade AN imported into the U.S. is subject to an antidumping duty cash deposit of approximately 254% of the value of the imports unless and until a review process is completed at the Commerce Department through which a Russian producer or exporter may demonstrate that it is not dumping to that extent and is entitled to a different rate. The Commerce Department is currently considering whether another Russian AN product is covered by the Russian Order. If the product is not covered, we would likely see competition from this product in the AN market of the U.S. In 2011 the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission also completed a sunset review of the Russian Order against AN from Russia to determine whether the Russian Order should remain in effect. These agencies decided that the Russian Order is still needed to address unfair trade in Russian AN, and, as a result, the Russian Order will remain in place for at least an additional five years, until 2016. There is also an outstanding antidumping duty order against AN from the Ukraine (Ukrainian Order), which is currently being reviewed by the same two agencies. This sunset review is scheduled to be completed in mid-2013 and will decide whether the Ukrainian Order will remain in place for another five years beyond 2013. If, as a result of the sunset review, the Ukrainian Order were to be revoked, we would likely face large volumes of unfairly priced Ukrainian AN in the U.S. market, with loss of revenue and market share for our AN business. 17 Table of Contents For 2012, net sales of fertilizer grade AN accounted for 14% and 9% of our Chemical Business net sales and consolidated net sales, respectively. If the antidumping orders are changed, as discussed above, these changes could result in a substantial increase in the amount of imported AN sold in the U.S. at prices less than the U.S. producers are required to charge in order to cover their cost plus a profit, and could have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. We may have inadequate insurance. While we maintain liability, property and business interruption insurance, including certain coverage for environmental contamination, it is subject to coverage limits and policies may exclude coverage for some types of damages (which may include warranty claims). Although there may currently be sources from which such coverage may be obtained, it may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or the possible types of liabilities that may be incurred by us may not be covered by our insurance. In addition, our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies or the dollar amount of the liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. LSB is a holding company and depends, in large part, on receiving funds from its subsidiaries to fund our indebtedness. Because LSB is a holding company and operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, including PCC and ThermaClime, LLC (ThermaClime) and its subsidiaries, LSBs ability to meet its obligations depends, in large part, on the operating performance and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to make distributions and pay dividends to LSB. Under its loan agreements, ThermaClime and its subsidiaries may only make distributions and pay dividends to LSB under limited circumstances and in limited amounts. Loss of key personnel could negatively affect our business. We believe that our performance has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts of our principal executive officers. We cannot promise that our principal executive officers will continue to be available. Jack E. Golsen has an employment agreement with us. No other principal executive has an employment agreement with us. The loss of some of our principal executive officers could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We are effectively controlled by the Golsen Group. Jack E. Golsen, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), members of his immediate family, including Barry H. Golsen, our Vice Chairman and President, entities owned by them and trusts for which they possess voting or dispositive power as trustee (collectively, the Golsen Group) owned as of February 15, 2013, an aggregate of 3,085,864 shares of our common stock and 1,020,000 shares of our voting preferred stock (1,000,000 of which shares have .875 votes per share, or 875,000 votes), which together votes as a class and represents approximately 17% of the voting power of our issued and outstanding voting securities as of that date. Thus, the Golsen Group may be considered to effectively control us. As a result, the ability of other stockholders to influence our management and policies could be limited. We have not paid dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years. Although we have paid dividends on our outstanding series of preferred stock (two of the three outstanding series of preferred stock are owned by the Golsen Group), we have not paid cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years, and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in the near future. However, our Board of Directors has not made a decision whether or not to pay such dividends on our common stock in 2013. In addition, there are certain limitations contained in our loan agreements, which limit our subsidiaries from up streaming funds to LSB that may limit our ability to pay dividends on our outstanding common stock. Future issuance or potential issuance of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock, our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings and could dilute the percentage ownership of our common stockholders. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market, or the issuance of a substantial amount of our common stock as the result of conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stocks, or the perception that such sales or conversions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could dilute the value of common stock held by our existing stockholders. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of, or conversions of our outstanding preferred stocks into, shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Such future sales or conversions could also significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our common stockholders. 18 Table of Contents We are subject to a variety of factors that could discourage other parties from attempting to acquire us. Our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board of Directors and, except in limited circumstances, a two-thirds vote of outstanding voting shares to approve a merger, consolidation or sale of all, or substantially all, of our assets. In addition, we have entered into severance agreements with our executive officers and some of the executive officers of certain subsidiaries that provide, among other things, that if, within a specified period of time after the occurrence of a change in control of LSB, these officers are terminated, other than for cause, or the officer terminates his employment for good reason, we must pay such officer an amount equal to 2.9 times the officers average annual gross salary for the last five years preceding the change in control. We have authorized and unissued (including shares held in treasury) 52,589,102 shares of common stock and 4,230,000 shares of preferred stock as of December 31, 2012. These unissued shares could be used by our management to make it more difficult, and thereby discourage an attempt to acquire control of us. We have adopted a preferred share purchase plan, which is designed to protect us against certain creeping acquisitions, open market purchases and certain mergers and other combinations with acquiring companies. The foregoing provisions and agreements are designed to discourage a third party tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempts to acquire control of us and could have the effect of making it more difficult to remove incumbent management. Delaware has adopted an anti-takeover law which, among other things, will delay for three years business combinations with acquirers of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of publicly-held companies (such as us), unless;  prior to such time the Board of Directors of the corporation approved the business combination that results in the stockholder becoming an invested stockholder;  the acquirer owned at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock of such company prior to commencement of the transaction;  two-thirds of the stockholders, other than the acquirer, vote to approve the business combination after approval thereof by the Board of Directors; or  the stockholders of the corporation amend its articles of incorporation or by-laws electing not to be governed by this provision.
