Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. 38 Table of Contents Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects A. Operating Results. You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other information included in this annual report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Item 3.D Key Information-Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. Overview We are a leading manufacturer of spindle motors for hard disk drives in the world. We manufacture and sell spindle motors for hard disk drives and various other small precision brushless direct current electricity, or DC, motors and other products through 26 subsidiaries in Japan and 105 subsidiaries in other countries, including China, Singapore, Europe, the United States, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Mexico, as of March 31, 2009. Principal Items in Our Statement of Operations Net sales- Our net sales are generated primarily from the sales of our products. Nidec recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sale price is fixed and collectivity is reasonably assured. As such, revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery to customers in domestic sales and at the time of shipment for export sales with respect to small precision motors, mid-size motors and electronic and optical components, and upon receipt of final customer acceptance with respect to machinery. We maintain data with respect to net sales by product type. We also maintain data with respect to net sales of our products based on the entities which are our operating segments. For a detailed discussion of our operating segments, see -Segment Information below. Cost of products sold- Our cost of sales consists of fixed costs and variable costs, which are primarily material, parts, and manufacturing expenses, including personnel costs, depreciation, and facility maintenance costs. We periodically assess the market value of our inventory based on sales trends and forecasts and technological changes. We write off inventories when it is apparent that there is no possibility of future sales or usage. The write off of inventory is recorded as cost of sales. Fixed costs limit our ability to reduce costs in times of decreased demand, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results. Selling, general and administrative expenses- Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, and other expenses relating to our selling, general and administrative activities. Research and development expenses- Research and development expenses primarily related to personnel costs and depreciation of equipment relating to our research and development activities. Other income (expense)- Other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains or losses and gains or losses from marketable securities. 39 Table of Contents Effects of Our Recent Acquisition Activities on Our Financial Statements As discussed under Item 4.A Information on the Company-History and Development of the Company, we have sought growth by investing in, or acquiring companies with motors, drives and other related products and technologies. Depending on the circumstances, we acquire a majority interest or a substantial minority interest in the target companies. Our approach has been to identify underperforming companies with advanced products and technologies. In the past years, we have acquired substantial interests in a number of major companies, several of which were public companies in Japan. On November 8, 2006, we acquired a 98.9% share in Fujisoku Corporation (FSKC). FSKC manufactures and sells industrial switches, memory cards, panel switches and electronic measuring instruments. On December 27, 2006, we acquired all of the voting rights of the Motors & Actuators business of Valeo S.A., France. As part of the acquisition of the Motors & Actuators business of Valeo S.A, we acquired all shares of the companies listed below, and therefore, from the acquisition date, we started consolidating them in our financial statements.  Nidec Motors & Actuators  Nidec Motors & Actuators (Germany) GmbH  NMA Property Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH  Nidec Motors & Actuators (Poland) Sp.Z o.o.  Nidec Motors & Actuators (Spain) S.A.  Nidec Motors & Actuators (USA) INC.  Nidec Motors & Actuators (Mexico) S. de R.L. de C.V. The NMA group manufactures motors and actuators for automobiles, such as air flow systems, body closure systems, occupant positioning systems and brake systems. On February 23, 2007, we acquired a 87.1% share in Brilliant Manufacturing Limited (currently Nidec Brilliant Co., Ltd. (NBC)). NBC is engaged in manufacturing and sales of base plate die-casting and top cover used in hard disk drives. By acquiring BML, we increased our manufacturing capability in Asia. On April 27, 2007, we acquired a 51.8% share in Japan Servo Co., Ltd. (currently Nidec Servo Corporation (Nidec Servo)). Nidec Servo has long been engaged in the manufacture and sale of small motors and motor applied products. On June 13, 2008, we acquired all of the voting rights of Shanghai Nidec Automotive Electric Motors Limited. In addition, on August 1, 2008, we acquired an additional 3,500 new stocks of Copal Yamada Corporation. We had already owned 3,000 shares of Copal Yamada Corporation prior to August 1, 2008. As a result, the number of shares of Copal Yamada Corporations common shares held by NIDEC became 68.4%. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on NIDECs consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. On March 31, 2009, we disposed all of the shares of Nidec Nemicon Corporation, its subsidiary. This disposition did not have a material impact on NIDECs consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Effects of Foreign Currency Fluctuations A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the yen, most significantly, the U.S. dollar. Our business is thus sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the 40 Table of Contents yen-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Our consolidated financial statements are subject to both translation risk and transaction risk. Translation risk is the risk that our consolidated financial statements for a particular period or for a particular date are affected by changes in the prevailing exchange rates of the currencies in those countries in which we conduct business against the Japanese yen. The translation effect, even if it is substantial, is a reporting consideration and does not reflect our underlying results of operations. Transaction risk arises when the currency structure of our costs and liabilities deviates from the currency structure of our sales proceeds and assets. A substantial portion of our overseas sales are made in U.S. dollars. While sales denominated in U.S. dollars are, to a significant extent, offset by U.S. dollar denominated costs, we generally have had a significant net long U.S. dollar position. With respect to costs not denominated in U.S. dollars, we believe that we have been able to reduce the level of transaction risk to the extent that our overseas subsidiaries incur costs in currencies that generally follow the U.S. dollar. Transaction risk remains for products sold in U.S. dollars to the extent that we must purchase parts for our products from Japan, the costs for which are denominated in yen. Changes in the fair values of our foreign exchange forward contracts and changes in option prices under our foreign currency option agreements are recognized as gains or losses on derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of income. For a more detailed discussion of these instruments, you should read Item 11 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk and Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. 41 Table of Contents Results of Operations  Year Ended March 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2008 The following table sets forth selected information relating to our income and expense items for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2009.

Net sales of electronic and optical components for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 do not include the sales amounts of OPU business pursuant to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.144, Accounting for the impairment or disposal of Long-Lived Assets. All prior period OPU amounts have also been so excluded as to enable comparisons between the relevant net sales amounts for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Net Sales The following table is a summary of our net sales for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2009: (Yen in millions) 2008 2009 Inc/Dec % Net sales: Small precision motors: Hard disk drives spindle motors ¥ 223,068 ¥ 181,255 ¥ (41,813 ) (18.7 )% Other small precision brushless DC motors 92,359 73,187 (19,172 ) (20.8 )% Brushless DC fans 46,525 37,345 (9,180 ) (19.7 )% Other small precision motors 23,730 22,286 (1,444 ) (6.1 )% Sub-total 385,682 314,073 (71,609 ) (18.6 )% Mid-size motors 96,377 77,156 (19,221 ) (19.9 )% Machinery 73,253 72,090 (1,163 ) (1.6 )% Electronic and optical components 145,896 122,552 (23,344 ) (16.0 )% Others 27,548 27,587 39 0.1 % Consolidated total ¥ 728,756 ¥ 613,458 ¥ (115,298 ) (15.8 )% Our net sales decreased ¥115,298 million, or 15.8%, from ¥728,756 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥613,458 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Net sales of all of our product categories, excluding other products, decreased. This decrease was primarily due to the recent world-wide recession that resulted in a decrease in demand for our products and the yen appreciating against the U.S. dollar. (Small precision motors) Net sales of small precision motors decreased ¥71,609 million, or 18.6%, from ¥385,682 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥314,073 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Net sales of each product category included in small precision motors are as shown below. Hard disk drives spindle motors Net sales of our hard disk drives, or HDD, spindle motors decreased ¥41,813 million, or 18.7%, from ¥223,068 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥181,255 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Unit shipments of the spindle motors decreased 4.7%. Sales decreased largely due to a 12% yen appreciation against the U.S. dollar. Unit shipments of our spindle motors for 2.5-inch HDDs increased over 20% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales of spindle motors for 2.5-inch HDDs increased 43 Table of Contents 10% to account for 46% of our total sales of spindle motors for HDDs, closing on to 51% represented by the spindle motors for 3.5-inch HDDs. Net sales of HDD spindle motors accounted for 30.6% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 29.5% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2009. Other small precision brushless DC motors Net sales of our other small precision brushless DC motors decreased ¥19,172 million, or 20.8%, from ¥92,359 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥73,187 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased customer demand caused by the economic slowdown. Net sales of our other small precision brushless DC motors accounted for 12.7% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 11.9% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2009. Brushless DC fans Net sales of brushless DC fans decreased ¥9,180 million, or 19.7%, from ¥46,525 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥37,345 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decreased was mainly due to decreased customer demand in the personal computer, or PC, industry. Net sales of brushless DC fans accounted for 6.4% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 6.1% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2009. Other small precision motors Net sales of other small precision motors decreased ¥1,444 million, or 6.1%, from ¥23,730 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥22,286 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was mainly due to decreases in sales by Nidec Sankyo, Nidec Servo and their subsidiaries. Net sales of other small precision motors accounted for 3.2% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 3.6% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2009. (Mid-size motors) Net sales of our mid-size motors decreased ¥19,221 million, or 19.9%, from ¥96,377 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥77,156 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in sales of mid-size motors for automobiles by Nidec Motors & Actuators, and a decrease in sales of mid-size motors for home appliances by Nidec Shibaura, which were impacted by the economic slowdown. Net sales of our mid-size motors accounted for 13.2% of our total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 12.6% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2009. (Machinery) Net sales of our machinery decreased ¥1,163 million, or 1.6%, from ¥73,253 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥72,090 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in new capital investments by our customers, although sales of liquid crystal display, or LCD, panel handling robots by Nidec Sankyo increased. The increase in sales of these robots reflected improved 44 Table of Contents demand and delayed adverse impacts of the current economic recession as customers generally plan the capital investments for these types of products far in advance. Net sales of our machinery accounted for 10.1% of our total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 11.8% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2009. (Electronic and optical components) Net sales of our electronic and optical components decreased ¥23,344 million, or 16.0%, from ¥145,896 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥122,552 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in sales of shutters for digital cameras and mobile phone cameras by Nidec Copal, electronic components by Nidec Electronics and sales by Nidec Sankyos subsidiaries, all of which were impacted by the recent economic slowdown. Net sales of our electronic and optical components accounted for 20.0% of our total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 2009. (Others) Net sales of our other products increased ¥39 million, or 0.1%, from ¥27,548 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥27,587 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Net sales of our other products accounted for 3.8% of our total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 4.5% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2009. Cost of Products Sold Our cost of products sold decreased ¥88,444 million, or 15.5%, from ¥571,337 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥482,893 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in sales and production. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales increased from 78.4% for the year ended March 31, 2008 to 78.7% for the year ended March 31, 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased ¥1,627 million, or 3.2%, from ¥50,168 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥51,795 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This increase reflected the fact that, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recorded a smaller non-recurring gain and a smaller gains related to fixed assets than we did for the year ended March 31, 2008. The decreases in such gains more than offset the decrease in personnel expenses and sales commissions for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 6.9% for the year ended March 31, 2008 to 8.5% for the year ended March 31, 2009. Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expenses decreased ¥2,745 million, or 9.2%, from ¥29,709 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥26,964 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was 45 Table of Contents primarily due to our cost reduction measures in response to the recent world wide-recession, although research and development expenses relating to mid-size motors for automobiles increased in response to increased demand for our new products for electric vehicles, or EV, and hybrid electric vehicles, or HEV. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses increased from 4.1% for the year ended March 31, 2008 to 4.4% for the year ended March 31, 2009. Operating Income As a result of the foregoing factors, our operating income decreased ¥25,736 million, or 33.2%, from ¥77,542 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥51,806 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. As a percentage of net sales, operating income decreased from 10.6% for the year ended March 31, 2008 to 8.4% for the year ended March 31, 2009. Other Income (Expense) Our other expenses decreased ¥8,510 million, or 64.0%, from ¥13,287 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥4,777 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This change was mainly due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses. Our foreign exchange loss decreased ¥9,530 million, or 72.1%, from ¥13,218 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥3,688 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This was principally due to appreciation in the value of the yen against relevant foreign currencies compared to the previous fiscal year. The exchange rate of the yen against the U.S. dollar as of March 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 was ¥118.05, ¥100.19 and ¥98.23, respectively. We incurred losses from marketable securities in the amount of ¥1,305 million for the year ended March 31, 2009, while we had gains from marketable securities in the amount of ¥454 million for year ended March 31, 2008. This change was mainly due to an increase in the other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities as compared to the year ended March 31, 2008. Income from continuing operations before Income Taxes As a result of the foregoing, our income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased ¥17,226 million, or 26.8%, from ¥64,255 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥47,029 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Income Taxes Our income taxes decreased ¥3,466 million, or 21.8%, from ¥15,930 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥12,464 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. The effective income tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2009 was higher compared to the effective income tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2008. The main reason of this increase was due to a net impact of an increase in the impact on the effective tax rate of the valuation allowance, decrease in tax on undistributed earnings due to tax law changes and decrease in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for reductions for tax positions of prior years. For a detailed discussion of our income taxes, see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. 46 Table of Contents Minority Interest in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interest in income of our consolidated subsidiaries decreased ¥2,708 million, or 41.8%, from ¥6,485 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥3,777 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in incomes of partially owned group companies such as Nidec Servo Corporation, Nidec Copal Corporation and their subsidiaries, resulting from reduced demand for their products caused by the recent world wide recession. Equity in Net Loss (Income) of Affiliated Companies We had equity in net loss of affiliated companies in the amount of ¥48 million for the year ended March 31, 2009, while we recorded equity in net income of affiliated companies in the amount of ¥39 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Income from continuing operations As a result of the foregoing, our income from continuing operations decreased ¥11,139 million, or 26.6%, from ¥41,879 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥30,740 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. As a percentage of net sales, our income from continuing operations decreased from 5.7% for the year ended March 31, 2008 to 5.0 % for the year ended March 31, 2009. Loss on discontinued operations Our loss on discontinued operations increased ¥1,664 million, or 230.2%, from ¥723 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥2,387 million for the year ended March 31, 2009, reflecting our decision to discontinue the OPU business as of December 31, 2008. For a detailed discussion of our loss on discontinued operations, see Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements. Net Income As a result of the foregoing, our net income decreased ¥12,803 million, or 31.1%, from ¥41,156 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥28,353 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. As a percentage of net sales, our net income decreased from 5.6% for the year ended March 31, 2008 to 4.6 % for the year ended March 31, 2009. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations  Year Ended March 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2007 Net Sales (Yen in millions) 2007 2008 Inc/Dec % Net sales: Small precision motors: Hard disk drives spindle motors ¥ 198,196 ¥ 223,068 ¥ 24,872 12.5 % Other small precision brushless DC motors 74,445 92,359 17,914 24.1 Brushless DC fans 38,656 46,525 7,869 20.4 Other small precision motors 6,684 23,730 17,046 255.0 Sub-total 317,981 385,682 67,701 21.3 Mid-size motors 57,389 96,377 38,988 67.9 Machinery 82,944 73,253 (9,691 ) (11.7 ) Electronic and optical components *1 129,635 145,896 16,261 12.5 Others 26,702 27,548 846 3.2 Consolidated total ¥ 614,651 ¥ 728,756 ¥ 114,105 18.6 % *1 As of December 31, 2008, we discontinued OPU business which had been included within electronic and optical components. Net sales of electronic and optical components for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 do not include the sales amounts of OPU business pursuant to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.144, Accounting for the impairment or disposal of Long-Lived Assets. All prior period OPU amounts have also been excluded as to enable comparisons between the relevant net sales amount for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Our net sales increased ¥114,105 million, or 18.6%, from ¥614,651 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥728,756 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was due mainly to the impact of newly consolidated subsidiaries and sales of small precision motors, especially hard disk drives spindle motors. Net sales of Fujisoku Corporation, which has been consolidated since November 2006, is included in Electronic and optical components. Nidec Motors & Actuators and its group companies, which have been consolidated since December 2006, are included in Mid-size motors. Brilliant Manufacturing Limited and its subsidiaries, which have been consolidated since February 2007, are included in Small precision motors. Japan Servo Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries, which have been consolidated since April 2007, are included in Small precision motors. (Small precision motors) Net sales of small precision motors increased ¥67,701 million, or 21.3%, from ¥317,981 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥385,682 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Net sales of each product included in small precision motors are as below. Hard disk drives spindle motors Net sales of our hard disk drives spindle motors increased ¥24,872 million, or 12.5%, from ¥198,196 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥223,068 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Sales volume of hard disk drives spindle motors increased by 16.0% compared to the previous fiscal year. 48 Table of Contents This increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales of spindle motors for 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard disk drives. Sales volumes of the motors for 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard disk drives increased by 18.7% and 16.2%, respectively. The yen-based average sales price decreased 3.0% in comparison to the previous fiscal year, however, the yen appreciated against U.S. dollar by 2.3% during the same period. Therefore, in effect, dollar-based sales prices declined almost 1.0%. This was mainly due to a decrease in the average price of motors for 2.5-inch hard disk drives, approximately 1.5% on a dollar basis, in spite of an increase in the average price of 3.5-inch hard disk drives, approximately 1% on a dollar basis. Net sales of hard disk drives spindle motors accounted for 32.2% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 30.6% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008. Other small precision brushless DC motors Net sales of our other small precision brushless DC motors increased ¥17,914 million, or 24.1%, from ¥74,445 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥92,359 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the contribution from newly consolidated companies, net sales of other small precision brushless DC motors increased ¥6,099 million or 8.2%, from ¥74,445 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥80,544 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales of stepping motors and brushless DC motors for optical disk drives. Net sales of our other small precision brushless DC motors accounted for 12.1% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 12.7% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008. Brushless DC fans Net sales of brushless DC fans increased ¥7,869 million, or 20.4%, from ¥38,656 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥46,525 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the contribution from newly consolidated companies. Excluding the contribution from newly consolidated companies, net sales of brushless DC fans slightly increased ¥721 million or 1.9%, from ¥38,656 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥39,377 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Net sales of brushless DC fans accounted for 6.3% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 6.4% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008. Other small precision motors Net sales of other small precision motors increased ¥17,046 million, or 255.0%, from ¥6,684 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥23,730 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the contribution from newly consolidated companies. Excluding this contribution, net sales of other small precision motors slightly increased ¥66 million or 1.0%, from ¥6,684 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥6,750 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Net sales of other small precision motors accounted for 1.1% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 3.2% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008. (Mid-size motors) Net sales of our mid-size motors increased ¥38,988 million, or 67.9%, from ¥57,389 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥96,377 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the contribution from newly consolidated companies, net sales of mid-size motors increased ¥11,724 million or 24.3%, from ¥48,306 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥60,030 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This 49 Table of Contents increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales of motors for automobiles such as power steering systems, and for home appliances such as air conditioners. Net sales of our mid-size motors accounted for 9.3% of our total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 13.2% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008. (Machinery) Net sales of our machinery decreased ¥9,691 million, or 11.7%, from ¥82,944 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥73,253 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in sales of industrial robots, card readers and high-speed pressing machines, affected by a lower demand from decreased capital investment by our customers, which offset an increase in net sales of factory automation equipment and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Net sales of our machinery accounted for 13.5% of our total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 10.1% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008. (Electronic and optical components) Net sales of our electronic and optical components increased ¥16,261 million, or 12.5%, from ¥129,635 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥145,896 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the contribution from newly consolidated companies, net sales of electronic and optical components increased ¥12,344 million or 9.7%, from ¥126,654 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥138,998 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primary due to an increase in net sales of optical components such as shutters for mobile phones and digital cameras, and electronic components for amusement machines. Net sales of our electronic and optical components accounted for 21.2% of our total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 20.0% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2008. (Others) Net sales of our other products increased ¥846 million, or 3.2%, from ¥26,702 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥27,548 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales of automobile parts. Cost of Products Sold Our cost of products sold increased ¥100,012 million, or 21.2%, from ¥471,325 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥571,337 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the contribution from the newly consolidated companies, our cost of products sold increased ¥36,539 million, or 7.9% from ¥460,702 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥497,241 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to increase in sales volume and a negative impact from changes in exchange rates. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales increased from 76.7% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 78.4% for the year ended March 31, 2008. 50 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased ¥4,759 million, or 10.5%, from ¥45,409 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥50,168 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the contribution from the newly consolidated companies, our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased ¥2,002 million, or 4.5% from ¥44,473 million for year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥42,471 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This decrease was mainly due to a non-recurring gain, a decrease in legal fees, a decrease in commission fees and an increase in gains related to fixed assets compared to the year ended March 31, 2007. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 7.4% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 6.9% for the year ended March 31, 2008. Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expenses decreased ¥2,272 million, or 7.1%, from ¥31,981 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥29,709 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the contribution from the newly consolidated companies, our research and development expenses decreased ¥4,456 million, or 14.2% from ¥31,354 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥26,898 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses related to mid-sized motors due to the commencement of mass production. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses decreased from 5.2% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 4.1% for the year ended Mach 31, 2008. Operating Income As a result of the foregoing factors, our operating income increased ¥11,606 million, or 17.6%, from ¥65,936 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥77,542 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. As a percentage of net sales, operating income decreased from 10.7% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 10.6% for the year ended March 31, 2008. Other Income (Expense) We had other income in the amount of ¥1,678 million for the year ended March 31, 2007, while we incurred other expense in the amount of ¥13,287 million for year ended March 31, 2008. This change was mainly due to foreign exchange losses. We had foreign exchange gains in the amount of ¥1,815 million for the year ended March 31, 2007, while we incurred foreign exchange loss in the amount of ¥13,218 million for the year ended March 31, 2008.This was principally due to appreciation in the value of the yen against relevant foreign currencies compared to the year ended March 31, 2007. The exchange rate of the yen against the U.S. dollar as of March 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 was ¥117.47, ¥118.05 and ¥100.19, respectively. Gains from marketable securities, net decreased ¥489 million from ¥943 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥454 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This decrease was mainly due to decrease in gain from the sales of marketable securities as compared to the year ended March 31, 2007. 51 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations before Income Taxes As a result of the foregoing, our income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased ¥3,359 million, or 5.0%, from ¥67,614 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥64,255 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Income Taxes Our income taxes decreased ¥2,015 million, or 11.2%, from ¥17,945 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥15,930 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. The effective income tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2008 was lower compared to the effective income tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2007. The main reason of this decrease was due to a net impact of decrease in the impact on the effective tax rate of valuation allowance and tax benefit in foreign subsidiaries and the adoption of FIN 48 as well as the effects of transfer pricing taxation paid for the prior year. For the year ended March 31, 2007, Nidec incurred additional tax expense of approximately ¥2,850 million as a result of an examination by the tax authority in relation to transfer pricing. There was no such impact in the current year. This decrease in tax expense was partially offset by the impact of FIN 48. Minority Interest in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interest in income of our consolidated subsidiaries decreased ¥2,331 million, or 26.4%, from ¥8,816 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥6,485 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the contribution from the newly consolidated companies, minority interest in income of our consolidated subsidiaries decreased ¥3,208 million, or 36.4% from ¥8,816 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥5,608 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Minority interest of group companies such as Nidec Sankyo Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries decreased ¥3,537 million due primarily to a decrease in their profitability, which more than offset an increase in minority interest in income of other companies such as Nidec Copal Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. Equity in Net Loss (Income) of Affiliated Companies We incurred equity in net loss of affiliated companies in the amount of ¥73 million for the year ended March 31, 2007, while we had equity in net income of affiliated companies in the amount of ¥39 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Income from continuing operations As a result of the foregoing, our income from continuing operations increased ¥1,099 million, or 2.7%, from ¥40,780 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥41,879 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. As a percentage of net sales, our income from continuing operations decreased from 6.6% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 5.7 % for the year ended March 31, 2008. Loss on discontinued operations Our loss on discontinued operations decreased ¥125 million, or 14.7%, from ¥848 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥723 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Net Income As a result of the foregoing, our net income increased ¥1,224 million, or 3.1%, from ¥39,932 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥41,156 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. 52 Table of Contents Segment Information Based on the applicable criteria set forth in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (SFAS No. 131), we have sixteen reportable operating segments on which we report in our consolidated financial statements. These reportable operating segments are legal entities. One of them is NCJ, while the others are Nidecs fifteen consolidated subsidiaries: NET, NCC, NCD, NCS, NCH, NCF, NSNK, NCPL, NTSC, NCEL, NSRV, NSBC, NSCJ, NMA, and NNSN. For the information required by SFAS No. 131, see Note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. The NCJ segment comprises NIDEC Corporation in Japan, which primarily produces and sells hard disk drive motors, DC motors, fans, and Mid-size motors.

The NTSC segment comprises Nidec Tosok Corporation, a subsidiary in Japan, which primarily produces and sells automobile parts and machinery. The NCEL segment comprises Nidec Copal Electronics Corporation, a subsidiary in Japan, which primarily produces and sells electronic parts. The NSRV segment comprises Nidec Servo Corporation in Japan, which primarily produces and sells DC motors, fans and other small precision motors. NSRV was acquired in April 2007. The NSBC segment comprises Nidec Shibaura Corporation, a subsidiary in Japan, which primarily produces and sells mid-size motors. The NSCJ segment comprises Nidec-Shimpo Corporation, a subsidiary in Japan, which primarily produces and sells power transmission drives, measuring machines and electric potters wheels. 53 Table of Contents The NMA segment comprises Nidec Motors & Actuators (Germany) GmbH and other subsidiaries in Europe and North America, which primarily produce and sell in-car motors. NMA was acquired in December 2006. The NNSN segment comprises Nidec Nissin Corporation, a subsidiary in Japan, which primarily produces and sells optical components. The All Others segment comprises subsidiaries that are operating segments but not designated as reportable segments due to materiality. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the amounts in the segment information do not reflect discontinued operations, and previous fiscal years segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. We evaluate our financial performance based on segmental profit and loss, which consists of sales and operating revenues less operating expenses. Segmental profit or loss is determined using the accounting principles in the segments country of domicile. NCJ, NSNK, NCPL, NTSC, NCEL, NSRV, NSBC, NSCJ, and NNSN apply Japanese GAAP. NET applies Thai accounting principles. NCC and NCD apply Chinese accounting principles. NCS applies Singaporean accounting principles, NCH applies Hong Kong accounting principles. NCF applies Philippine accounting principles and NMA applies mainly International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Thus, our segmental data has not been prepared under U.S. GAAP on a basis that is consistent with our consolidated financial statements or on any other single basis that is consistent between segments. While there are several differences between U.S. GAAP and the underlying accounting principles used by the operating segments, the principal differences that affect segmental operating profit or loss are accounting for pension and severance costs, directors bonuses and leases.

Operating income of NMA were ¥59 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 and ¥555 million for the year ended March 31, 2008, respectively. NMA has been consolidated since December 2006. The NMA segment comprises NMA(Germany) and other subsidiaries in Europe and North America, which primarily produce and sell motors for automobiles. Net sales of NNSN decreased ¥1,342 million, or 11.5%, from ¥11,673 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥10,331 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a rapid decrease in sales of products related to engineering plastics and plastics for lens resulting from the recent world-wide recession. Operating income of NNSN decreased ¥312 million, or 51.1%, from ¥610 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥298 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This was due primarily to a rapid decrease in sales. 60 Table of Contents Net sales of NNSN increased ¥16 million, or 0.1%, from ¥11,657 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥11,673 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of engineering plastic moldings for cars. Operating income of NNSN increased ¥65 million, or 11.9%, from ¥545 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥610 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an improvement in production costs in manufacturing engineering plastic dies. Within the All Others segment, net sales decreased ¥74,807 million, or 19.0% from ¥393,750 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥318,943 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This was due primarily to a decrease in demand for many of the products of subsidiaries belonging to this segment resulting form the recent world-wide recession. Operating income decreased ¥9,200 million, or 40.6% from ¥22,663 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥13,463 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. This was due primarily to a decrease in sales. Within the All Others segment, net sales increased ¥64,095 million, or 18.7% from ¥342,954 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥407,049 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. The main reason of this increase was the addition of newly consolidated subsidiaries. Operating income increased ¥9,746 million, or 79.6% from ¥12,251 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥21,997 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. The main reason of this increase was the expansion in sales of NSHK and the addition of newly consolidated subsidiaries. Accounting Changes In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 clarifies that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, (FSP FAS 157-2), Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. FSP FAS 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. We adopted SFAS 157 as of April 1, 2008 for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, as discussed in note No. 21 Fair value. We are currently evaluating the potential impact from adopting FSP FAS 157-2 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158) Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). The measurement date provision of SFAS 158 requires that the measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations be as of the date of the employers statement of financial position, not up to three months earlier as had been permitted by Statements 87 and 106. We adopted this provision of SFAS 158 as of April 1, 2008, as discussed in note No. 15 Pension and severance plans. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (SFAS 159), The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159 enables entities to choose to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings. We adopted SFAS 159 as of April 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity as we did not elect to report any financial assets and liabilities under the fair value option. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 (SFAS 161), Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, financial 61 Table of Contents performance, and cash flows. We adopted SFAS 161 as of January 1, 2009. The required disclosures are presented in note No. 20 Derivatives. The adoption of SFAS 161 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162 (SFAS 162), The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. SFAS 162 is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for nongovernmental entities. We adopted SFAS 162 as of November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements to Be Adopted in Future Periods In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007) (SFAS 141R), Business Combinations. SFAS 141R requires that assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, that acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and the changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense. SFAS 141R is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact from adopting SFAS 141R on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (SFAS 160), Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 recharacterizes minority interests in a subsidiary as non-controlling interests and requires the presentation of noncontrolling interests as equity in the consolidated balance sheets, and separate identification and presentation in the consolidated statement of income of net income attributable to the entity and the noncontrolling interest. SFAS 160 also requires all the transactions for changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation be recognized as equity transactions. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact from adopting SFAS 160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 165 (SFAS 165), Subsequent Events. SFAS 165 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. SFAS 165 requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. SFAS 165 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact from adopting SFAS 165 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166 (SFAS 166), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS 166 requires more information about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. SFAS 166 also eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. SFAS 166 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entitys first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. We are currently evaluating the potential impact from adopting SFAS 166 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 62 Table of Contents In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167 (SFAS 167), Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). SFAS 167 requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. SFAS 167 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entitys first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. We are currently evaluating the potential impact from adopting SFAS 167 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Nidec and its subsidiaries in Japan maintain their records and prepare their financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and its foreign subsidiaries in conformity with those of their countries of domicile. Certain adjustments and reclassifications have been incorporated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates, judgments and assumptions. An accounting estimate in our financial statements is a critical accounting estimate if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and either different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. We have identified the following critical accounting policies with respect to our financial presentation. Inventories Our inventories, which consist primarily of finished products such as hard disk drives spindle motors, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined principally using the weighted average cost method and the market value is mainly based on net realizable value less direct sales costs. These products are exposed to frequent innovation, the introduction of new products to the market and short product life cycles due to rapid technological advances and model changes. We periodically assess the market value of our inventory, based on sales trends and forecasts and technological changes and write off inventories with no movement for one year or when it is apparent that there is no possibility of future sales or usage. We may have to recognize large amounts of inventory write-off as a result of an unexpected decline in market conditions, changes in demand or our product line. Other-than-temporary Losses on Marketable Securities We review the market value of our marketable securities at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our marketable securities consist of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. Other-than-temporary losses on individual marketable securities are charged to income in the period as incurred. Losses on available-for-sale securities are classified as other-than-temporary based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying amount. Our management employs a systematic methodology to assess the recoverability of such investments by reviewing the financial position of underlying companies and prevailing market conditions in which these companies operate to determine if our investment in each of these companies is impaired and whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts. 63 Table of Contents We believe that the accounting estimate related to investment impairment is a critical accounting policy because:  it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires our management to make assumptions about future financial condition and cash flows of investees; and  the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the total assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our operating income would be material. As of March 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of our marketable securities was ¥12,332 million. We recorded a loss on marketable securities in the amount of ¥1,305 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. The following table shows the other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities. Year ended March 31, 2007 2008 2009 2009 (Yen in millions and U.S. dollars in thousands) Other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities ¥ 11 ¥ 287 ¥ 1,617 $ 16,461 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the historical rate of credit losses experienced. We additionally provide allowances for specific customer accounts deemed uncollectible. Management assesses the need for specific allowances based on changes in the customers financial condition and length of time the account has remained overdue. As our customer base is highly concentrated, the nonfulfillment or delay in payment caused by even one of our major customers may require us to record a significant additional allowance. For the year ended March 31, 2009, sales to our six largest customers represented approximately 36% of our net sales. Our accounts receivable are likewise concentrated. At March 31, 2009, six customers represented ¥36,693 million, or 33%, of our gross accounts receivable. In addition, during economic downturns, a certain number of our customers may have difficulty with their cash flows. Although we believe that we can make reliable estimates for doubtful accounts, customer concentrations as well as overall economic conditions may affect our ability to accurately estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to ¥717 million as of March 31, 2009. Our trade notes and accounts receivable balance was ¥123,211 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, as of March 31, 2009. The following table shows the provision for doubtful accounts, net of reversal. Year ended March 31, 2007 2008 2009 2009 (Yen in millions and U.S. dollars in thousands) Provision for doubtful accounts, net of reversal ¥ 117 ¥ 312 ¥ 349 $ 3,552 Deferred Tax Assets As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which were included within our consolidated balance sheet. As of March 31, 2009, we 64 Table of Contents had deferred tax assets in the amount of ¥27,981 million. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in our income statement. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of ¥7,026 million as of March 31, 2009, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward for tax purposes incurred by our subsidiaries. Our determination to record valuation allowances is based on a history of unprofitable periods by the subsidiaries and their estimated future profitability. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Impairment of Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, comprising approximately 27% of our total assets as of March 31, 2009, and other intangible assets. We carefully monitor the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of these assets. Since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, the first year we adopted testing for impairment of long-lived assets under FAS No. 144, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these asset groups may not be recoverable, we have reviewed the respective asset groups for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the group. We review idle assets for possible impairment based on their condition or based on the probability of future use. Changes in technology, market demand, our planned product mix, or in our intended use of these assets, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. In addition, changes in general industry conditions such as increased competition could cause the value of a certain amount of these assets to change. Estimates and assumptions used in both estimating the useful life and evaluating potential impairment issues require a significant amount of judgment. As such, our judgment as to the recoverability of capitalized amounts and the amount of any impairment will be significantly impacted by such factors. Acquisitions In recent years, we have made a number of significant business acquisitions, which have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires that the net assets, tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities of the acquired company be recorded at fair value, with the difference between the cost of an acquired company and the fair value of the acquired net assets recorded as goodwill. Application of the purchase method requires our management to make complex judgments about the allocation of the purchase price to that of the fair value of the net assets we acquire and estimation of the related useful lives. The determinations of fair value of assets and liabilities are primarily based on factors such as cash flow analysis and quoted market prices among others. We also obtained independent appraisers reports for significant purchases. Valuation of Goodwill We assess the impairment of acquired goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or on an annual basis. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; 65 Table of Contents  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;  significant negative industry or economic trends;  significant decline in the stock price of the acquired entity for a sustained period; and  market capitalization of the acquired entity relative to its net book value. When we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles may not be recoverable, based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Changes in the projected discounted cash flow could negatively affect the valuations. Goodwill amounted to ¥71,060 million as of March 31, 2009. Pension Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans based on actuarial valuations. For periodic pension calculation, we are required to assume some components, which include expected return on plan assets, discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and average remaining years of service. We use long-term historical actual return information and estimated future long-term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop our expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is assumed based on the rates available on high-quality fixed-income debt instruments (rated AA by a recognized rating agency) for which the timing and amount of cash inflows approximates the estimated outflows of the defined benefit plan. We assume a rate of increase in compensation levels and average remaining years of service based on our historical data. Changes in these assumptions will have an impact on our net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in discount rates and the expected rate of return on plan assets, holding all other assumptions constant. Yen in millions Effect on pre-tax income Effect on PBO For the year ending March 31, 2010 As of March 31, 2009 Discount rates 0.5% decrease ¥ (43 ) ¥ 1,622 0.5% increase 42 (1,509 ) Expected rate of return on plan assets 0.5% decrease ¥ (37 ) 0.5% increase 37 Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, on April 1, 2007. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties. These factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax positions as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. The actual resolutions of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Revenue recognition - We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assumed. For small precision motors, mid- 66 Table of Contents size motors and electronic and optical components, these criteria are generally met at the time a product is delivered to the customers site which is the time the customer has taken title to the product and the risk and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred. These conditions are met at the time of delivery to customers in domestic sales (FOB destination) and at the time of shipment for export sales (FOB shipping point). Revenue for machinery sales is recognized upon receipt of final customer acceptance. At the time the related revenue is recognized, we make provisions for estimated product returns. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our principal needs for cash are:  payments for the purchase of parts and raw materials;  payments for the purchase of equipment for our production facilities;  selling, general and administrative expenses such as research and development expenses;  payments for the purchase of shares of companies targeted under our acquisitions strategy;  employees salaries, wages and other payroll costs;  repayment of short-term debt;  payments of dividends to our shareholders; and  taxes. We fund our growth primarily with funds generated from operations, proceeds from issuances of new shares, unsecured bonds, including convertible bonds, and borrowings from banks. We believe that these funding sources, as well as future sources of external funding, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the current fiscal year. The uses of funds raised are capital expenditures, investment in and financing of affiliated companies and repayment of borrowings from banks. We intend to implement additional funding programs as the need arises, or as appropriate funding opportunities arise, to further strengthen our capital base, and thus enhance the balance between borrowings and equity capital. Part of the funds raised are reserved and utilized for potential mergers and acquisitions. Total assets increased ¥31,170 million from ¥671,714 million to ¥702,884 million as of March 31, 2009. This was mainly due to an increase of cash and cash equivalents of ¥100,157 million, as mentioned under Cash Flows below. On the other hand, trade accounts receivable and inventories decreased ¥37,380 million and ¥12,343 million, respectively, due primarily to a decrease in net sales and the effect of exchange rate changes. In addition, property, plant and equipment decreased ¥9,144 million due primarily to the effect of exchange rate changes and the disposal of fixed assets used in discontinued operations. Total liabilities increased ¥61,253 million from ¥283,944 million to ¥345,197 million as of March 31, 2009. This was mainly due to an increase in short-term borrowings of ¥152,488 million owing to redemption of corporate bonds, purchase of treasury stock and marketable securities, additional investments in subsidiaries and our effort to increase liquidity in response to the global financial crisis. On the other hand, trade notes and accounts payable decreased ¥51,300 million due primarily to a decrease in purchases which was affected by the sales decrease and the effect of exchange rate changes. In addition, current portion of long-term debt decreased ¥27,313 million due mainly to redemption of corporate bonds. Working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, decreased ¥19,626 million from ¥103,899 million to ¥84,273 million as of March 31, 2009 as compared to March 31, 2008. Our receivable turnover ratio is calculated by dividing net sales for the fiscal year by the fiscal year-end trade notes and accounts receivable balance. Our receivable turnover ratio was 5.0 for the year ended March 31, 2009, compared to 4.4 for the year ended March 31, 2008. The inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing cost of products sold for the year ended March 31 by the year-end inventory balance. Our inventory turnover ratio was 8.4 for the year ended March 31, 2009, compared to 8.2 for the year ended March 31, 2008. 67 Table of Contents We have been trying to reduce production levels to enable us to reduce our excess inventory levels and avoid write-offs. Total shareholders equity decreased ¥22,436 million from ¥319,584 million as of March 31, 2008 to ¥297,148 million as of March 31, 2009. The decrease of ¥22,436 million was primarily due to our purchase of treasury stock of ¥23,775 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of ¥16,091 million attributed to the significant appreciation of the yen. Those factors offset increases in retained earnings of ¥19,548 million. As a result, the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets decreased 5.3% from 47.6% as of March 31, 2008 to 42.3% as of March 31, 2009. This decrease was due to an approximately ¥100,000 million increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from increased short-term borrowings. The short-term borrowings were intended to mitigate financial risks possibly deriving from continued economic crisis. Therefore, without the ¥100,000 million increase, the share holders equity to total assets would be 49.3% at March 31, 2009. Our current planned capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 include investments of approximately ¥23,254 million in production plants and facilities, mainly in Asia, and various additional other investments. We anticipate that the funds required for those capital expenditures will be financed by cash provided by our operating and financing activities or from our available cash and cash equivalents. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities decreased ¥28,585 million from ¥94,816 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥66,231 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Amid global economic crisis, the decreased cash inflows in operating activities were due primarily to the decreases in net income of ¥12,803 million and foreign currency adjustments of ¥6,214 million. On the other hand, the increases in changes in operating assets and liabilities of ¥2,410 million, resulted from a decrease in net sales. The ¥2,410 million consisted of the decreases in operating assets of ¥54,828 million and notes and accounts payable of ¥52,418 million. Net cash provided by operating activities increased ¥30,093 million from ¥64,723 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥94,816 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to improved working capital efficiency and operating profit. The increase was mainly due to the cash inflows from the following components which constitutes operating cash flows.  ¥6,337 million of positive impact from an increase in depreciation compared to previous fiscal year;  ¥7,937 million of positive impact from an increase in foreign currency adjustments compared to previous fiscal year; and  ¥7,140 million of positive impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to previous fiscal year. Net cash used in investing activities increased ¥8,935 million from ¥43,724 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 to ¥52,659 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. The increased cash outflows in investing activities were due primarily to the increases in additions to property, plant and equipment of ¥2,841 million, purchases of marketable securities of ¥3,378 million and payments for additional investments in subsidiaries of ¥1,243 million. Net cash used in investing activities decreased ¥35,211 million from ¥78,935 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to ¥43,724 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. The decrease was mainly due to the decreases in acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries, payments for additional investments in subsidiaries and additions to property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities was ¥91,160 million for the year ended March 31, 2009 while net cash used in financing activities was ¥27,280 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. The increased cash inflows of ¥118,440 million in financing activities were due mainly to an increase in short-term borrowings of ¥169,057 million, including those for the purpose of increasing cash on hand in response the global financial crisis. We aim to manage our cash on hand depending on changing market conditions. In April 2009, we repaid ¥85,300 million or a portion of the increased short-term borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by a similar amount. The increase in short-term borrowings offset redemption of 68 Table of Contents corporate bonds of ¥26,412 million, purchases of treasury stock of ¥23,756 million and an increase in dividends paid of ¥1,457 million. Net cash used in financing activities was ¥27,280 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 while net cash provided by financial activities was ¥8,943 million for the year ended March 31, 2007. The increased cash outflows in financial activities were mainly due to a decrease in short-term borrowings of ¥37,772 million and an increase in the payment for dividends of ¥1,456 million. Fore more detailed information about our short-term borrowings and long-term debt, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements As a result of the foregoing factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, our total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents increased ¥100,157 million from ¥100,809 million as of March 31, 2008 to ¥200,966 million as of March 31, 2009. For a discussion of our use of financial instruments for hedging purposes, see Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. An important requirement for success in the highly competitive markets in which we operate is the ability to supply products that incorporate cutting-edge technology and quality. Given that competition has been intensifying, one of the major aims of our research and development activities in recent years has been to reduce the cost of designing without affecting the quality of our products. As of March 31, 2009, we employed 2,451 people engaged in research and development activities mainly in Japan as well as in China, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Germany, Poland, Spain, France and the U.S.A. Our position as the leading supplier of hard disk drive spindle motors to the major hard disk drive manufacturers provides us with access to information regarding the industry needs, which we seek to incorporate into our research and development activities. We seek to proactively develop products that meet the precise needs of each customer. Based on the precision engineering expertise gained throughout our history of making motors, we have concentrated our research and development activities on drive motor technologies; However, we conduct research in many areas, including basic technologies of spindle motors to be used in information equipment, and technologies for new types of motors such as fluid dynamic bearing technology, which we have been developing over the past 15 years. We are diversifying our research and development activities, which were heavily concentrated on small motor technology in the field of spindle motors, to motor and drive technologies. For example, through Nidec Shibaura Corporation and Nidec Tosok Corporation, we focus on the research and development of motors for home electric appliances and motors for automobile parts. Through Nidec-Shimpo Corporation, our subsidiary specializing in power transmission drives and variable speed drives, we have been focusing on the research and development of geared motors for color copiers. By doing so, we have been able to develop and market new products through our integrated sales design and production system. In January and February 2004, Nidec Copal, Nidec Copal Electronics and Nidec Sankyo became our consolidated subsidiaries. Nidec Copal has a substantial market share in shutters for digital cameras and has been developing shutters and lens units. It has developed vibration motors for mobile phones and laboratory systems equipment, among other industrial equipment-related products. Nidec Copal Electronics has developed ultra-precision fixed resistors for its circuit parts business and coreless type polygon laser scanners for its actuator business. It has also promoted the development of sensors for its pressure sensor business, mainly for the semiconductor equipment industry. Nidec Sankyo has developed intelligent mechanism 69 Table of Contents products, which have merged fine mechatronics and software, coupled with the development of ultra-precision processing technology. These activities include research and development of multimedia equipment and information accessory equipment such as computers, industrial equipment, home electronics and housing equipment. In April 2005, we opened Motor Engineering Research Laboratory in our Tokyo Office. Motor Engineering Research Laboratory develops basic research for various types of motors and aims to establish the foundation of motor technology going forward for our motor-related business. Recently, our principal research and development activities have included the following:  the development and improvement of basic motor characteristics. For example, in order to achieve a higher transfer rate of memory written on hard disks, higher rotation speeds are required of spindle motors. As a result, spindle motors which were formerly required to generate 5,400 rotations per minute are now required to generate 7,200 to 15,000 rotations per minute. These higher speeds can, however, produce more vibration. Such vibration, as well as the higher density of disks, can disrupt the read-write function of hard disk drives. Accordingly, rotation precision has become more important, and we are conducting research and development with a view to improving such precision;  the improvement of analysis and material technologies, including (1) improving technologies for investigating the impact of spindle motors on hard disks, (2) improving the cleanliness of materials and of manufacturing technology and (3) research into the development of uses of new materials for spindle motors;  the development and improvement of spindle motors for DVDs;  the development and improvement of DC fan motors with a high airflow capacity that helps disperse heat inside end products such as computers, game machines and audio-visual equipments;  the development and improvement of optical components including shutters and lens unit for digital cameras and lens products for blue-ray, vibration motors, stepping motors, dye sublimation printer, printer for IC cards and geared motors by Nidec Copal;  the development and improvement of actuator, pressure sensors and radiofrequency, or RF, components by Nidec Copal Electronics;  the development and improvement of LCD panel handling robots for large LCD, micro lens actuator units for mobile phone and card readers by Nidec Sankyo; and  the development and improvement of compact motors in automobiles for comfort and safety, such as seat adjuster, sunroof closure, windows closure, engine cooling, and ABS by Nidec Motors and Actuators. The core of our research and development activities is our Central Technical Laboratory, located at our headquarters in Kyoto. In addition to basic and applied research, the Central Technical Laboratory supports the development of products that incorporate the latest technology. Market requirements are becoming more demanding. To respond in a reliable and timely manner to these requirements we have established research and development bases in various countries and regions. Nidec operates technical centers most notably in Kyoto, and also in Tokyo, Shiga and Nagano Prefectures in Japan. These operations carry out research and development relating not only to the development of new products, but also to improve the quality of and production technology for existing products. 70 Table of Contents Utilizing state-of-the-art testing, inspection and measurement equipment, we are increasing our understanding and use of various basic technologies, not only precision motor machining technology, but also in fields such as mechanical and materials engineering and applied chemistry. Accurate and prompt inspection, analysis and measurement performed using state-of-the-art equipment are an integral element of our product and process development. The manufacture of precision motors requires high precision, measurement and analysis at the level of hundredths of a micron. Each material must be analyzed at the molecular level in order to prevent contamination, dust and gases, which are generated by adhesives and other materials and which can infiltrate minute gaps between the disk surface and the head. Using the latest equipment, our Research and Development Department conducts rigorous inspection, measurement and analysis, and utilizes the results to improve product design and process capabilities. Similarly, we respond to challenges such as noise reduction, using advanced equipment and our own methods. Today, noise reduction is a significant issue in the computer and consumer electronics fields. In order to address this issue, we have constructed acoustic test rooms, consisting of reverberation and sound anechoic chambers which conform to international standards, where we conduct tests, measurement and analysis. In addition to its motor business, Nidec Copal operates technology development centers in Itabashi, Tokyo and Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture. Nidec Copal Electronics has technology development centers in Tajiri, Miyagi Prefecture and Sano, Tochigi Prefecture. Nidec Sankyo operates its technology development centers in Shimosuwa, Komagane and Chino in Nagano Prefecture and Itabashi, Tokyo. We incurred research and development expenses of ¥31,981 million for the year ended March 31, 2007, ¥29,709 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 and ¥26,964 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Much of our research and development is conducted by our domestic subsidiaries, which we then reimburse for costs incurred. We also cooperate with our affiliates to conduct significant research and development. We anticipate spending approximately ¥27,000 million on research and development in the year ending March 31, 2010. We believe that our research and development expenses are sufficient for sustaining our competitiveness in the motor industry and other industries. D. Trend Information.
