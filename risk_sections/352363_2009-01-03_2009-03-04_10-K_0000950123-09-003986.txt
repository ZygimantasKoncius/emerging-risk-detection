OVERVIEW AND NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS General Liz Claiborne, Inc. designs and markets a global portfolio of retail-based premium brands including JUICY COUTURE, KATE SPADE, LUCKY BRAND JEANS and MEXX. We also have a group of department store-based brands with consumer franchises including the LIZ CLAIBORNE and MONET families of brands, MAC & JAC, KENSIE and DANA BUCHMAN and the licensed DKNY® JEANS, DKNY® ACTIVE and DKNY® MENS brands. In 2007, we performed a review of our operations to assess options to best evolve our strategy on a sustainable, go-forward basis. We reorganized our operations and management structure to reflect a brand-centric approach, designed to optimize the operational coordination and resource allocation of our businesses across multiple functional areas including specialty retail, outlet, wholesale apparel, wholesale non-apparel, e-commerce and licensing. For a discussion of our segment reporting structure, see Business Segments below. With this new approach in place, we implemented strategic imperatives including (i) creating and maintaining a more competitive cost structure through staff reductions, closing and consolidating distribution facilities and office space, discretionary expense cuts, process re-engineering and supply chain rationalization; (ii) working toward developing best-in-class retail capabilities and innovating our supply chain; (iii) narrowing our portfolio to a select group of brands and (iv) committing the necessary resources to support growth in our brands. During the latter portion of 2008 and into 2009, we continued to seek to (i) enhance liquidity and institute cost saving measures and (ii) rationalize our sourcing and supply chain structure, which resulted in our decision to enter into the recently announced buying agency arrangements with Li & Fung Limited, as described below under the heading Sourcing and Supply Chain. During the latter portion of 2008, we also continued to rationalize our portfolio of brands in order to focus on key brands that we believe provide the best opportunities for sustainable growth. We remain cautious about the near-term retail environment due to the significant slowdown in consumer spending, which reflects the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic environment in the US, as well as abroad. In summary, the measure of our success in the future will depend on our ability to navigate through a difficult macroeconomic environment and challenging market conditions, manage our costs and expenses and protect and enhance our liquidity position, execute on our strategic vision, including attracting and retaining the management talent necessary for such execution, designing and delivering products that are acceptable to the marketplaces that we serve, sourcing the manufacture and distribution of our products on a competitive and efficient basis and evolving our retail capabilities. For a discussion of certain risks relating to our business, see Item 1A  Risk Factors below. Liquidity Enhancement and Cost Reduction We were greatly impacted by recessionary pressures in 2008, including a drastic decline in consumer spending in the second half of the year. As we anticipate that the global economic recession will continue throughout 2009 and perhaps beyond, we are focusing on carefully managing those factors within the Companys control, most importantly spending, including reducing our planned 2009 capital budget to a range of $60 million to $70 million (from $194 million in 2008), maximizing inventory productivity by tightening assortments to develop SKU efficiencies and sharpening our price-points to maximize our inventory turns for both wholesale and retail operations. We will continue our streamlining efforts to drive cost out of our operations through supply chain and overhead initiatives that are aimed at driving efficiencies, as well as improving our working capital and operating cash flows. Our cost reduction efforts have also included tighter controls surrounding discretionary spending, a freeze in merit increases, the cessation of our quarterly dividend program and the elimination of approximately 375 positions 5 Table of Contents across the Company. We have also announced the closure of our Mt. Pocono, PA distribution center and the associated elimination of an additional 350 positions, with the closure expected to be completed late in the first quarter of 2009. In addition, pursuant to the recently announced agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Li & Fung Limited (Li & Fung), whereby Li & Fung was appointed as our exclusive buying agent for all of our brands and products (other than jewelry), we will receive at closing a payment of $75 million and an additional payment of up to $8 million to offset the restructuring expenses associated with the transaction. The agreement provides that all or a portion of the closing payment be refunded under limited circumstances. This transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter of 2009. Inclusive of the actions above, we have closed six distribution centers, eliminated approximately 2,700 global staff positions, streamlined our brand portfolio by selling, closing or licensing 14 brands and have significantly reduced redundant management functions throughout the organization, since June 2007. In January 2009, we completed the amendment and extension of our bank credit facility, which was previously scheduled to expire in October 2009. Our borrowing availability under the amended and extended credit facility is determined primarily by the level of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, the payment of $75 million from Li & Fung at the closing of our transaction expected late in the first quarter of 2009 and the projected borrowing availability under our amended and extended credit facility will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Nevertheless, there can be no certainty that availability under our amended and extended credit facility will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. The sufficiency and availability of our projected sources of liquidity may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, any delay or failure to close the announced transactions with Li & Fung; the level of our operating cash flows, which will be impacted by retailer and consumer acceptance of our products, general economic conditions and the level of consumer discretionary spending; our ability to comply with our financial covenants (as amended) and other covenants included in our debt and credit facilities; the status of, and any further adverse changes in, our credit ratings; the financial wherewithal of our larger department store and specialty store customers; and interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, our amended and extended credit facility contains a borrowing base that is determined by the level of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. If we do not have a sufficient borrowing base at any given time, borrowing availability under our amended and extended credit facility may not be sufficient to support our liquidity needs. Insufficient borrowing availability under our amended and extended credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the continuing uncertainty and risks relating to future economic conditions, we may, from time to time, explore various initiatives to improve our liquidity, including sales of various assets, additional cost reductions and other measures. In addition, where conditions permit, we may also, from time to time, seek to retire, exchange or purchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully complete any of such actions if necessary. Sourcing and Supply Chain In 2008, we entered into an agreement with Hong Kong-based, global consumer goods exporter Li & Fung, whereby Li & Fung acts as the primary global apparel sourcing agent for the MEXX brand and MEXXs existing buying agent offices were integrated into the Li & Fung organization. On February 23, 2009, we entered into a long-term, exclusive buying agency agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Li & Fung, pursuant to which Li & Fung will act as the primary global apparel and accessories sourcing agent for all brands in our portfolio, including LUCKY BRAND, JUICY COUTURE, KATE SPADE, and Isaac Mizrahi designed LIZ CLAIBORNE NEW YORK, with the exception of the jewelry product lines. Li & Fung will continue as the primary sourcing agent for MEXX, as previously announced. Pursuant to the agreement, we will receive at closing a payment of $75 million and an additional payment of up to $8 million to offset the restructuring expenses associated with the transaction. Our agreement with Li & Fung provides for the refund of a portion of the closing payment in certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of our company, the sale or discontinuation of any current brand or certain termination events. This transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter of 2009. Going forward, we will pay to Li & Fung an agency commission based on the cost of product purchases through Li & Fung. Our buying agent offices in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Shanghai and Shenzhen will be integrated into the Li & Fung 6 Table of Contents organization. We currently anticipate that approximately 250 of the Companys employees will become employees of Li & Fung at closing and that an additional 225 support positions in our overseas offices will be eliminated. The impact on our US sourcing employees will not be known for several months as the transition progresses. Portfolio Rationalization Since the second half of 2007, we have continually sought to rationalize our extensive portfolio of brand offerings in order to better focus on those key brands that we believe provide the most favorable opportunity for global expansion and brand extension strategies. In the past eighteen months, we have disposed of certain assets, including trademarks, in our former Emma James, Intuitions, J.H. Collectibles, Tapemeasure, C&C California, Laundry by Design, prAna and Ellen Tracy brands. We also consolidated our Tint brand into LIZ & CO. and Stamp 10 brand into AXCESS and closed our FIRST ISSUE brand. We entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kohls Corporation (Kohls) whereby Kohls sources and sells products under our DANA BUCHMAN brand. We also completed the closure of our SIGRID OLSEN brand. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, we further rationalized our portfolio by entering into an exclusive long-term global licensing agreement with Elizabeth Arden, Inc. (Elizabeth Arden) for our Company owned fragrance brands. Our fragrance brands consist of many well-known and highly-ranked products, including JUICY COUTURE, CURVE BY LIZ CLAIBORNE, LUCKY BRAND and the LIZ, REALITIES, BORA BORA and MAMBO fragrances. We also assigned all of our rights and obligations under our USHER fragrance license to Elizabeth Arden. We believe the licensing of our fragrance business will afford us the opportunity to realize profitable results with reduced risk, continue to successfully develop and market brand-enhancing fragrances in a capital efficient manner and leverage our strength in brand building with Elizabeth Ardens expertise in developing and growing fragrance businesses, while continuing to sharpen our focus on our core competencies in apparel and accessories. We also terminated our business relationship with Narciso Rodriguez and disposed our former Enyce brand. The completion of the Narciso Rodriguez and Enyce transactions removed loss generating operations from our portfolio and facilitates our brand-focused strategy and efforts to more effectively allocate resources to powerful brands with sustainable growth. International Operations International sales represented 35.5% of our total sales in 2008. Our international operations are subject to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and consist principally of our MEXX Europe and MEXX Canada operations, as well as the introduction of certain of our US-based brands into Europe, Canada and, to a lesser extent, Asia. Our principal executive offices are located in New York City, although we maintain sales operations on a global basis, including locations in the United States, the Netherlands and Canada. Business Segments In connection with the strategic review discussed above, we configured our operations to reflect the financial missions, cultural profiles and focal points appropriate for each of our reportable segments. Beginning in the second quarter of 2007, we reported two segments: Direct Brands and Partnered Brands. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we re-examined our reportable segments and determined that the economic characteristics of our MEXX operating segment (in our former Direct Brands reportable segment) were no longer consistent with the other operating segments in our former Direct Brands reportable segment. Accordingly, we present three reportable segments as follows:  Domestic-Based Direct Brands segment, which is comprised of the specialty retail, outlet, wholesale apparel, wholesale non-apparel (including accessories, jewelry and handbags), e-commerce and licensing operations of our three domestic retail-based brands: JUICY COUTURE, KATE SPADE and LUCKY BRAND. 7 Table of Contents  International-Based Direct Brands segment, which is currently comprised of the specialty retail, outlet, concession, wholesale apparel, wholesale non-apparel (including accessories, jewelry and handbags), e-commerce and licensing operations of MEXX, our international retail-based brand.  Partnered Brands segment, which is comprised of the wholesale apparel, wholesale non-apparel, specialty retail, outlet, e-commerce and licensing operations of our wholesale-based brands including: AXCESS, CLAIBORNE (mens), CONCEPTS BY CLAIBORNE, DANA BUCHMAN(a), KENSIE, LIZ & CO., LIZ CLAIBORNE, MAC & JAC, MARVELLA, MONET, TRIFARI and the Companys licensed DKNY® JEANS, DKNY® ACTIVE and DKNY® MENS brands. (a) On January 17, 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kohls Corporation (Kohls), naming Kohls as the exclusive retailer of our DANA BUCHMAN brand. As a result, we closed our former DANA BUCHMAN operations in the first half of 2008 and launched the DANA BUCHMAN line in Kohls stores during the first quarter of 2009. We also present our results on a geographic basis based on selling location, between Domestic (wholesale customers, licensing, Company-owned specialty retail and outlet stores located in the United States and e-commerce sites) and International (wholesale customers, licensing and Company-owned specialty retail and outlet stores and concession stores located outside of the United States). We, as licensor, also license to third parties the right to produce and market products bearing certain Company-owned trademarks; the resulting royalty income is included within the results of the associated segment.

Our domestic wholesale sales are made primarily to department store chains and specialty store customers. Retail sales are made through our own retail and outlet stores. Wholesale sales are also made to international customers, military exchanges and to other channels of distribution. International sales accounted for 35.5% of 2008 net sales from continuing operations, as compared to 33.3% in 2007. In Europe, wholesale sales are made primarily to department store and specialty store customers, while retail sales are made through concession stores within department store locations, as well as our own retail and outlet stores. In Canada, wholesale sales are made primarily to department store chains and specialty stores, and retail sales are made through our own retail and outlet stores. In other international markets, including Asia, the Middle East and Central and South America, we operate principally through third party licensees, virtually all of which purchase products from us for re-sale at freestanding retail stores and dedicated department store shops they operate. We also sell to distributors who resell our products in these territories. Wholesale sales (before allowances) from continuing operations to our 100 largest customers accounted for 71% of 2008 wholesale sales (before allowances) from continuing operations (or 54% of net sales from continuing operations), as compared to 82% of 2007 wholesale sales (before allowances) from continuing operations (or 67% of net sales from continuing operations). No single customer accounted for more than 7% of wholesale sales (before allowances) from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007, (or 5% of net sales from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007), except for Macys, Inc., which accounted for 13% and 17% of wholesale sales (before allowances) from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007, respectively, or 10% and 14% of net sales from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007, respectively (see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Many major department store groups make centralized buying decisions; accordingly, any material change in our relationship with any such group could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales. Sales to the Companys domestic department and specialty store customers are made primarily through our New York City showrooms. Internationally, sales to our department and specialty store customers are made through several of our showrooms, including those in the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. For further information concerning our domestic and international sales, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview; Competition, below. Orders from our customers generally precede the related shipping periods by several months. Our largest customers discuss with us retail trends and their plans regarding their anticipated levels of total purchases of our products for future seasons. These discussions are intended to assist us in planning the production and timely delivery of our products. We continually monitor retail sales in order to directly assess consumer response to our products. We have implemented in-stock reorder programs in several divisions to enable customers to reorder certain items through electronic means for quick delivery. See Manufacturing below. Many of our retail customers participate in our in-stock reorder programs through their own internal replenishment systems. During 2008, we continued our domestic in-store sales, marketing and merchandising programs designed to encourage multiple item regular price sales, build one-on-one relationships with consumers and maintain our merchandise presentation standards. These programs train sales associates on suggested selling techniques, product, merchandise presentation and client development strategies and are offered for many of our brands, including our JUICY COUTURE, LIZ CLAIBORNE and LUCKY BRAND and our licensed DKNY® JEANS brand. In 2008, we continued the expansion of our domestic in-store shop and fixture programs, which is designed to enhance the presentation of our products on department store selling floors generally through the use of proprietary fixturing, merchandise presentations and graphics. In-store shops operate under the following brand names: AXCESS, CLAIBORNE, CONCEPTS BY CLAIBORNE, DKNY® JEANS, DKNY® MENS, JACK SPADE, JUICY COUTURE, KATE SPADE, KENSIE, KENSIE GIRL, LIZ CLAIBORNE NEW YORK, LIZ & CO, 14 Table of Contents LUCKY BRAND and MEXX. Our accessories operations also offer an in-store shop and fixture program. In 2008, we installed an aggregate of approximately 750 in-store shops and in 2009, we plan to install an aggregate of approximately 210 additional in-store shops. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources. We spent $135.4 million on advertising, marketing and promotion expenditures for all of our brands in 2008, including $57.7 million on national advertising, compared to aggregate advertising, marketing and promotion expenditures in 2007 of $205.9 million, including $61.5 million on national advertising. MANUFACTURING In 2008, we entered into an agreement with Hong Kong-based, global consumer goods exporter Li & Fung, whereby Li & Fung acts as the primary global apparel sourcing agent for the MEXX brand and MEXXs existing buying agent offices were integrated into the Li & Fung organization. On February 23, 2009, we entered into a long-term, exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung, pursuant to which Li & Fung will act as the primary global apparel and accessories sourcing agent for all brands in our portfolio, including LUCKY BRAND, JUICY COUTURE, KATE SPADE, and Isaac Mizrahi designed LIZ CLAIBORNE NEW YORK, with the exception of the jewelry product lines. Li & Fung will continue as the primary sourcing agent for MEXX, as previously announced. Pursuant to the agreement, we will receive at closing a payment of $75 million and an additional payment of up to $8 million to offset the restructuring expenses associated with the transaction. Our agreement with Li & Fung provides for the refund of a portion of the closing payment in certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of the Company, the sale or discontinuation of any current brand or certain termination events. This transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter of 2009. Going forward, we will pay to Li & Fung an agency commission based on our product purchases through Li & Fung. Our buying agent offices in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Shanghai and Shenzhen will be integrated into the Li & Fung organization. We currently anticipate that approximately 250 of the Companys employees will become employees of Li & Fung at closing and that an additional 225 support positions in our overseas offices will be eliminated. The impact on our US sourcing employees will not be known for several months as the transition progresses. Products produced in Asia represent a substantial majority of the Companys purchases. We also source product in the United States and other regions. During 2008, several hundred suppliers located in approximately 49 countries manufactured our products, with the largest finished goods supplier accounting for approximately 4.5% of the total of finished goods we purchased. Purchases from our suppliers are processed utilizing individual purchase orders specifying the price and quantity of the items to be produced. Most of our products are purchased as completed product packages from our manufacturing contractors, where the contractor purchases all necessary raw materials and other product components, according to our specifications. When we do not purchase packages, we obtain fabrics, trimmings and other raw materials in bulk from various foreign and domestic suppliers, which items are then delivered to our manufacturing contractors for use in our products. We do not have any long-term, formal arrangements with any supplier of raw materials. To date, we have experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements and consider our sources of supply adequate. We operate under substantial time constraints in producing each of our collections. See Sales and Marketing, above. In order to deliver, in a timely manner, merchandise which reflects current tastes, we attempt to schedule a substantial portion of our materials and manufacturing commitments relatively late in the production cycle, thereby favoring suppliers able to make quick adjustments in response to changing production needs and in time to take advantage of favorable (cost effective) shipping alternatives. However, in order to secure necessary materials and manufacturing facilities, we must make substantial advance commitments, often as much as five months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers for the items to be produced. We continue to seek to reduce the time required to move products from design to the customer. If we misjudge our ability to sell our products, we could be faced with substantial outstanding fabric and/or manufacturing commitments, resulting in excess inventories. See Item 1A  Risk Factors below. Our arrangements with Li & Fung and with our foreign suppliers are subject to the risks of doing business abroad, including currency fluctuations and revaluations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, terrorist activities, 15 Table of Contents pandemic disease and, in certain parts of the world, political, economic and currency instability. Our operations have not been materially affected by any such factors to date. However, due to the very substantial portion of our products that are produced abroad, any substantial disruption of our relationships with our foreign suppliers could adversely affect our operations. In addition, as we are outsourcing our current sourcing operation to Li & Fung and utilizing Li & Fung as an exclusive agent for substantially all of our product, we are subject to the risk of having to rebuild such sourcing capacity or find another agent or agents to replace Li & Fung in the event the agreement with Li & Fung terminates, or if Li & Fung is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement. In addition, as we rely on independent manufacturers, a manufacturers failure to ship product to us in a timely manner, or to meet quality or safety standards, could cause us to miss delivery dates to our customers. Failure to make deliveries could cause customers to cancel orders, refuse deliveries or seek reduced prices, all of which could have a material adverse affect on us. We will continue to maintain internal staff responsible for overseeing product safety compliance after the effective date of our announced agency agreement with Li & Fung. Our suppliers must have superior capacity, quality (of product, operation and human rights compliance) and financial resources. We expect all of our suppliers to adhere to the Liz Claiborne Standards of Engagement, which include standards relating to child labor, working hours, wage payments and working conditions generally. We have an ongoing program in place to monitor our suppliers compliance with our standards. In this regard, each year, our internal or external monitors inspect a substantial portion of our suppliers factories. Should we learn of a suppliers failure to comply with our standards, we urge the supplier to act quickly in order to comply. If a supplier fails to correct a compliance deficiency, or if we determine that the supplier will be unable to correct a deficiency, we may terminate our business relationship with the supplier. In addition, we are a participating company in the Fair Labor Associations program. The Fair Labor Association is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving working conditions worldwide. Our human rights compliance program was re-accredited by the Fair Labor Association in June 2008. This accreditation must be renewed every three years. We will continue to maintain internal staff responsible for ensuring compliance with our standards after the effective date of our announced agency agreement with Li & Fung. Additionally, we are a certified and validated member of the United States Customs and Border Protections Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program and expect all of our suppliers shipping to the United States to adhere to the Companys C-TPAT requirements, including standards relating to facility security, procedural security, personnel security, cargo security and the overall protection of the supply chain. In the event a supplier does not comply with our C-TPAT requirements or if we determine that the supplier will be unable to correct a deficiency, we may terminate our business relationship with the supplier. IMPORTS AND IMPORT RESTRICTIONS Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the United States, Canada and Europe is subject to duties. Until January 1, 2005, our apparel merchandise was also subject to quota. Quota represents the right, pursuant to bilateral or other international trade arrangements, to export restricted amounts of certain categories of merchandise into a country or territory pursuant to a visa or license. Pursuant to the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, quota on textile and apparel products was eliminated for World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries, including the United States, Canada and European countries, on January 1, 2005 (with respect to textiles and apparel imported from other WTO member countries). Quotas negotiated under the Safeguard Provisions of Chinas WTO accession agreement expired at the end of 2008. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) has formally announced that the electronic visa requirement for China was canceled for imports on January 1, 2009. In addition, the European Union announced the end of its surveillance program of China made products and does not require Import Licenses as of January 1, 2009. The United States may unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or other countries) in such increased quantities as to cause (or threaten) serious damage to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as anti-dumping actions). Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the US Government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a US industry. In January 2007, the US federal government imposed a Vietnam Import Monitoring Program on five broad product groups  shirts, trousers, sweaters, underwear and swimwear  to determine whether any of those imports might be unfairly traded 16 Table of Contents due to dumping. The results of this program have proven that there was insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation of monitoring of imports from Vietnam and concluded on January 20, 2009. We are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean Basin Initiative and other special trade programs. Each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the US and the other countries into which our products are imported and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of safeguard quota, or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels on products being imported from other countries, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We strive to reduce our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other things, adjustments in product design and fabrication and shifts of production among countries and manufacturers. In light of the very substantial portion of our products that are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations, executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns or quota provisions, could adversely affect our operations. Although we generally expect that the elimination of quota will result, over the long term, in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced abroad, the implementation of any safeguard quota provisions, countervailing duties, any anti-dumping actions or any other actions impacting international trade may result, over the near term, in cost increases for certain categories of products and in disruption of the supply chain for certain products categories. See Item 1A  Risk Factors below. Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulation in the US and other countries by other governmental agencies, including, in the US, the Federal Trade Commission, US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. Although we have not suffered any material inhibition from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets. DISTRIBUTION We distribute a substantial portion of our products through leased facilities. Our principal distribution facilities are located in California, Ohio, Rhode Island and the Netherlands. See Item 2  Properties below. BACKLOG On February 13, 2009, our order book reflected unfilled customer orders for approximately $640 million of merchandise, as compared to approximately $1.0 billion at February 15, 2008. These orders represent our order backlog. The amounts indicated include both confirmed and unconfirmed orders, which we believe, based on industry practice and our past experience will be confirmed. We expect that substantially all such orders will be filled within the 2009 fiscal year. We note that the amount of order backlog at any given date is materially affected by a number of factors, including seasonal factors, the mix of product, the timing of the receipt and processing of customer orders and scheduling of the manufacture and shipping of the product, which in some instances is dependent on the desires of the customer. Accordingly, order book data should not be taken as providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons. However, the decline in the value of unfilled customer orders reflects (i) the impact of brand activities that have been licensed, closed or exited and have not been presented as discontinued operations and (ii) general economic conditions. 17 Table of Contents TRADEMARKS We own most of the trademarks used in connection with our businesses and products. We also act as licensee of certain trademarks owned by third parties. The following table summarizes the principal trademarks we own and/or use in connection with our businesses and products: Owned Trademarks AXCESS LIZ & CO BORA BORA LIZ CLAIBORNE CLAIBORNE LIZ CLAIBORNE NEW YORK CONCEPTS BY CLAIBORNE LUCKY BRAND COUTURE COUTURE LUCKY YOU LUCKY BRAND CURVE MAC & JAC DANA BUCHMAN(a) MARVELLA DIRTY ENGLISH MEXX JACK SPADE MONET JUICY COUTURE REALITIES KATE SPADE SIGRID OLSEN KENSIE TRIFARI LIZ XX BY MEXX Licensed Trademarks DKNY® ACTIVE DKNY® JEANS DKNY® MENS (a) As discussed above, Kohls is the exclusive retailer for our DANA BUCHMAN brand, pursuant to a license agreement executed in January 2008. In addition, we own and/or use many other logos and secondary trademarks, such as the JUICY COUTURE crest and the LUCKY BRAND clover mark, associated with the above mentioned trademarks. We have registered, or applied for registration of, a multitude of trademarks throughout the world, including those referenced above, for use on a variety of apparel and apparel-related products, including accessories, home furnishings, cosmetics and jewelry, as well as for retail services. We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our brands, our products have from time to time been the object of counterfeiting. We have implemented an enforcement program, which we believe has been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the US and in major markets abroad. In markets outside of the US, our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including Lucky and Juicy, which would impede our use and registration of some of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have generally successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable 18 Table of Contents markets or in new product categories, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and additional brands to new markets. COMPETITION Notwithstanding our position as one of the largest fashion apparel and related accessories companies in the United States, we are subject to intense competition as the apparel and related product markets are highly competitive, both within the United States and abroad. We compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories, both domestic and foreign. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality and price and our ability to compete successfully depends upon a variety of factors, including among other things, our ability to:  anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;  develop quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers;  appropriately price products;  establish and maintain favorable brand name and recognition;  maintain and grow market share;  establish and maintain acceptable relationships with our retail customers;  provide appropriate service and support to retailers;  provide effective marketing support and brand promotion;  appropriately identify size and location of our retail stores and department store selling space;  protect our intellectual property; and  optimize our retail and supply chain capabilities. See Item 1A Risk Factors. Within our retail-focused Domestic-Based Direct Brands segment, our principal competitors vary by brand and include the following:  For JUICY COUTURE: BCBG, D&G, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Theory and Ralph Lauren  For LUCKY BRAND JEANS: Diesel, Guess, True Religion, 7 for all Mankind and Free People  For KATE SPADE: Coach, Cole Haan, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors and Tory Burch The principal competitors of our retail-focused International-Based Direct Brands segment include Esprit, Zara, Marco Polo, S. Oliver, H&M, Tommy Hilfiger, InWear/Matinique and other global European brands. Our principal competitors in the United States for the majority of the wholesale-based Partnered Brands segment (LIZ CLAIBORNE and MONET families of brands and our licensed DKNY® JEANS, DKNY® ACTIVE and DKNY® MENS brands) include Jones Apparel Group, Inc., Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, as well as department store private label brands. EMPLOYEES At January 3, 2009, we had approximately 15,000 full-time employees worldwide, as compared to approximately 16,500 full-time employees at December 29, 2007. In the US, we are bound by collective bargaining agreements with local or regional affiliates of UNITE HERE (which was previously known as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, prior to its merger with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union). In Canada, we are bound by collective bargaining agreements with UNITE HERE and two local supplemental agreements. Substantially all of the UNITE HERE represented employees are employed in warehouse and distribution facilities we operate within the United States (California, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania), and in Canada (British Columbia and Quebec). The 19 Table of Contents agreements covering Canada, Rhode Island, California, and Pennsylvania expire in May 2009 and the agreement covering the Ohio facility expires in June 2011. Collectively, these agreements cover approximately 900 of our full-time employees. The Pennsylvania distribution facility, which employed approximately 300 full-time employees, has been announced for closure in March 2009, resulting in a reduction in the full-time employee number covered by agreements to approximately 600. While relations between the Company and the union have historically been amicable, the Company cannot rule out the possibility of a labor dispute at one or more of its facilities. In addition, we are bound by an agreement with the Industrial Professional & Technical Workers International Union, covering approximately 200 of our full-time employees at our Santa Fe Springs, California facility and expiring on May 14, 2010. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory and to date we have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to labor disputes. Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, in evaluating the Company and its business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to continue to have the liquidity necessary, through cash flows from operations and availability under our amended and extended credit facility, may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including the level of our operating cash flows, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants included in our amended and extended credit facility, and the borrowing base requirement in our amended and extended credit facility that limits the amount of borrowings we may make based on a formula of, among other things, eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to (i) fund working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventory); (ii) invest in our information systems to support changes in our supply chain; (iii) fund other capital expenditures related to opening retail stores that were part of our retail expansion initiatives in 2008, the launch of our LIZ CLAIBORNE NEW YORK product line and normal maintenance activities; (iv) fund remaining efforts associated with our streamlining initiatives, which include consolidation of office space and distribution centers and reductions in staff; and (v) fund operational and contractual obligations. We also require cash to fund payments related to outstanding earn-out provisions of our previous acquisitions. In January 2009, we completed the amendment and extension of our bank credit facility, which was previously scheduled to expire in October 2009. The amended and extended credit facility is an asset-based facility, with our borrowing availability under the facility determined primarily by the level of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, the payment of $75 million from Li & Fung at the closing of our transaction expected late in the first quarter of 2009, and the projected borrowing availability under our amended and extended credit facility will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Nevertheless, there can be no certainty that availability under our amended and extended bank agreement will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. The sufficiency and availability of our projected sources of liquidity may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, any delay or failure to close the announced transaction with Li & Fung; the level of our operating cash flows, which will be impacted by retailer and consumer acceptance of our products, general economic conditions and the level of consumer discretionary spending; the status of, and any further adverse changes in, our credit ratings; our ability to comply with our financial covenants (as amended) and other covenants included in our debt and credit facilities; the financial wherewithal of our larger department store and specialty store customers; and interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, our agreement with Li and Fung provides for the refund of a portion of the closing payment under certain limited circumstances, including a change in control of our company, the sale or discontinuation of any of our current brands or certain termination events. In addition, our amended and extended credit facility contains a borrowing base that is determined by the level of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. If we do not have a sufficient borrowing base at any given time, borrowing availability under our amended and extended credit facility may not be sufficient to support our liquidity needs. 20 Table of Contents Insufficient borrowing availability under our amended and extended credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As of January 3, 2009, we held a Ba2 senior unsecured debt rating and Not Prime commercial paper rating from Moodys and a BB- senior unsecured debt rating from S&P. Moodys placed our senior unsecured debt rating under review for possible downgrade on January 14, 2009. There can be no assurances that we will not be further downgraded by either Moodys or S&P, and any such additional downgrade could adversely impact our ability to obtain financing in amounts needed or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Under our amended and extended bank credit facility, we are subject to a fixed charge coverage covenant as well as various other covenants and other requirements, such as financial requirements, reporting requirements and various negative covenants. Compliance with the financial covenants is dependent on the results of our operations, which are subject to a number of factors including the current economic conditions. The current economic environment has resulted in significantly lower employment levels, disposable income and actual and/or perceived wealth, significantly lower consumer confidence, and significantly lower retail sales. A continuation of this trend may lead to further reduced consumer spending, especially for fashion apparel and related products such as ours, which could adversely impact our net sales and cash flow, which would affect our compliance with the financial covenants. Should we be unable to comply with the requirements in our credit agreement, we would be unable to borrow under our credit agreement and any amounts borrowed could become due and payable immediately. Should we be unable to borrow under our credit agreement, our liquidity would likely be significantly impaired which would have a material adverse effect on us and our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the outstanding amounts under our credit agreement were to become immediately due and payable, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity, and results of operations. Because of the continuing uncertainty and risks relating to future economic conditions, we may, from time to time, explore various initiatives to improve our liquidity, including sales of various assets, additional cost reductions and other measures. In addition, where conditions permit, we may also, from time to time, seek to retire, exchange or purchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully complete any of such actions if necessary. General economic conditions in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world, including a continued weakening of the economy, restricted credit markets and lower levels of consumer spending, can affect consumer confidence and consumer purchases of discretionary items, including fashion apparel and related products, such as ours. The industries in which we operate have historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy and future economic outlook. Our results are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer spending, including, but not limited to, general economic and business conditions; consumer confidence; wages and employment levels; the housing market; consumer debt levels; availability of consumer credit; credit and interest rates; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; fuel and energy costs; energy shortages; the level of the stock market; taxes; general political conditions, both domestic and abroad; and the level of customer traffic within department stores, malls and other shopping and selling environments. The current volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have reached unprecedented levels and have significantly adversely impacted global economic conditions, resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in employment levels, disposable income and actual and/or perceived wealth and further declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. These conditions have and could further lead to continuing substantial declines in consumer spending over the foreseeable future. The current depressed economic environment has been characterized by a dramatic decline in consumer discretionary spending and has disproportionately affected retailers and sellers of consumer goods, particularly those whose goods are viewed as discretionary purchases, including fashion apparel and related products such as ours. We expect such declines to continue as the current recessionary period continues and disposable income declines. The current downturn and uncertain outlook in the global economy will likely continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The domestic and international political situation also affects 21 Table of Contents consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to further decreases in consumer spending. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing and transportation, could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or our ability to meet our customers demands. The prices for such fabrics depend largely on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors. In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher prices on to our customers. Our business is largely dependent on sales to a limited number of large U.S. department store customers, and our business could suffer as a result of consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and other ownership changes in the retail industry, and financial difficulties at our large department store customers. Many major department store groups make centralized buying decisions; accordingly, any material change in our relationship with any such group could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales. Our dependence on sales to a limited number of large U.S. department store customers is subject to our ability to respond effectively to, among other things, (i) these customers buying patterns, including their purchase and retail floor space commitments for apparel in general (compared with other product categories they sell) and our products specifically (compared with products offered by our competitors, including with respect to customer and consumer acceptance, pricing and new product introductions); (ii) these customers strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their private label initiatives; (iii) these customers desire to have the Company provide them with exclusive and/or differentiated designs and product mixes; (iv) these customers requirements for vendor margin support; (v) any credit risks presented by these customers, especially given the significant proportion of the Companys accounts receivable they represent and (vi) the effect of any potential consolidation among one or more of these larger customers, such as the merger between Macys Inc. and The May Department Store Company. We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores across the U.S. and Europe and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customers financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to our receivables from that customer. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Moreover, the difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our customers and consumers which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We may not be able to affect a turnaround of our MEXX Europe business. We are in the process of implementing initiatives announced in September 2008 to accelerate the turnaround of the MEXX business in Europe. These initiatives focus on enhancing the brand by improving product appeal, more closely linking the wholesale and retail presentations, strengthening retail operations and improving our supply chain model. To expedite this process, we have made key appointments to the MEXX Europe management team, which is under the leadership of Tom Fitzgerald, Senior Vice President, Direct Brands Services as interim CEO of MEXX Europe as we search for a new CEO of MEXX Europe. 22 Table of Contents There can be no assurances that these initiatives will maintain or improve the operating results of our MEXX Europe operations. We cannot assure the successful implementation and results of our long-term strategic plans. Our ability to execute our long-term growth plan and achieve our projected results is subject to a variety of risks, including the following:  Our strategic plan contemplated a significant expansion of our specialty retail business in our Domestic-Based Direct Brands and International-Based Direct Brands segments. The successful operation and expansion of our specialty retail business in our Direct Brands segments is subject to, among other things, our ability to successfully expand the specialty store base of our Direct Brands segments, our ability to successfully find appropriate sites, negotiate favorable leases, design and create appealing merchandise, manage inventory levels, install and operate effective retail systems, apply appropriate pricing strategies and integrate such stores into our overall business mix. There can be no assurances that we can be successful in this regard, and our inability to successfully expand our specialty retail business would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, in light of the current economic conditions and the dramatic decline in consumer spending especially for fashion apparel and related products such as ours, we have greatly limited our capital expenditure budget for 2009 and are planning on opening 10 to 12 new specialty and outlet stores in 2009.  We have announced a number of initiatives designed to achieve greater collaboration with our wholesale customers and to improve results of the Companys wholesale-based Partnered Brands. These initiatives include design agreements with Isaac Mizrahi with respect to our LIZ CLAIBORNE brand and John Bartlett with respect to our CLAIBORNE (mens) brand. Our wholesale customers have been seeking differentiated product and we believe that these design agreements will enable us to distinguish our product offering. However, there can be no assurances that these arrangements will result in improved product or that the resulting products will be acceptable to our wholesale customers or consumers. To help us improve our sourcing and supply chain capabilities at our Mexx Europe business, in 2008, we entered into an agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-based, global consumer goods exporter Li & Fung, whereby Li & Fung acts as the primary global apparel sourcing agent for the MEXX brand and MEXXs existing buying agent offices were integrated into the Li & Fung organization. On February 23, 2009, we entered into a long-term, exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung, pursuant to which Li & Fung will act as the primary global apparel and accessories sourcing agent for all brands in our portfolio, with the exception of the jewelry product lines. Li & Fung will continue as the primary sourcing agent for MEXX, as previously announced. Pursuant to the agreement, we will receive at closing a payment of $75 million and an additional payment of up to $8 million to offset the restructuring expenses associated with the transaction. This transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter of 2009. Going forward, we will pay to Li & Fung an agency commission based on our product purchases through Li & Fung. Our buying agent offices in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Shanghai and Shenzhen will be integrated into the Li & Fung organization. We currently anticipate that approximately 250 of the Companys employees will become employees of Li & Fung at closing and that 225 additional staff positions in our overseas offices will be eliminated. The impact on our US sourcing employees will not be known for several months as the transition progresses. There can be no assurances that we can be successful in these efforts and our failure to evolve our supply chain capabilities and reduce costs in this area will have a material adverse impact on our business and results. In addition, our agreement with Li and Fung provides for the refund of a portion of the closing payment under certain limited circumstances, including a change in control of our company, the sale or discontinuation of any of our current brands, or certain termination events. The success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing consumer demands and tastes and fashion trends, across multiple product lines, shopping channels and geographies. The apparel and accessories industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and tastes and fashion trends and to levels of discretionary spending, especially for fashion apparel and related products, which levels are currently significantly weak. We believe that our success is largely dependent on our 23 Table of Contents ability to effectively anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes across multiple product lines, shopping channels and geographies, in the design, pricing, styling and production of our products and in the merchandising and pricing of products in our retail stores. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to constant change. Also, we must maintain and enhance favorable brand recognition, which may be affected by consumer attitudes towards the desirability of fashion products bearing a mega brand label and which are widely available at a broad range of retail stores. We attempt to schedule a substantial portion of our materials and manufacturing commitments relatively late in the production cycle; however, in order to secure necessary materials and manufacturing facilities, we must make substantial advance commitments, often as much as five months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers for the items to be produced. We need to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings relatively far in advance, while minimizing excess inventory positions, and correctly balance the level of our fabric and/or merchandise commitments with actual customer orders. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles and brands or successfully meet changing customer and consumer demands in the future. In addition, we cannot assure any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received and supported by our wholesale customers or consumers. Our failure to gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, and to appropriately forecast our ability to sell products, could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with substantial outstanding fabric and/or manufacturing commitments, resulting in increases in unsold inventory or missed opportunities. If that occurs, we may need to employ markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess inventory, which may harm our business and results. At the same time, our focus on inventory management may result, from time to time, in our not having a sufficient supply of products to meet demand and cause us to lose potential sales. We cannot assure that we can attract and retain talented highly qualified executives, or maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees, both union and non-union. Our success depends, to a significant extent, both upon the continued services of our executive management team, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate and retain additional talented and highly qualified management in the future, including the areas of design, merchandising, sales, supply chain, marketing, production and systems, as well as our ability to hire and train qualified retail management and associates. In addition, we will need to provide for the succession of senior management. The loss of key members of management and our failure to successfully plan for succession could disrupt our operations and our ability to successfully operate our business and execute our strategic plan. We are bound by a variety of collective bargaining agreements with two unions, mostly in our warehouse and distribution facilities. We consider our relations with our non-union and union employees to be satisfactory and to date we have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to labor disputes. While our relations with the unions have historically been amicable, the Company cannot rule out the possibility of a labor dispute at one or more of its facilities, particularly in light of facility closings and in light of the expiration of certain union agreements in May 2009. Any such dispute could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our business could suffer if we cannot adequately establish, defend and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are significantly important to our success and competitive position. Accordingly, we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities on a worldwide basis. Counterfeiting of our products, particularly our JUICY COUTURE, LUCKY BRAND and KATE SPADE brands, continues, however, and in the course of our international expansion we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights in some of our trademarks or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have, in the past, resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurances that the actions taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our 24 Table of Contents products as a violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. Moreover, there can be no assurances that in certain countries others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other proprietary rights or that we will be able to successfully resolve such conflicts. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The loss of such trademarks and other proprietary rights, or the loss of the exclusive use of such trademarks and other proprietary rights, could have a material adverse effect on us. Any litigation regarding our trademarks or other proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly. Our success will depend on our ability to successfully develop or acquire new product lines or enter new markets or product categories. We have in the past, and may, from time to time, acquire or develop new product lines and/or enter new markets or product categories, including through licensing arrangements. This would include our acquisition of KATE SPADE in 2006, the license of our DANA BUCHMAN brand to Kohls and the sale of our LIZ & CO. and CONCEPTS BY CLAIBORNE brands outside of better department stores, and the recent association of our Liz Claiborne and Claiborne brands with known designers. These activities are accompanied by a variety of risks inherent in any such new business venture, including the following:  Our ability to identify appropriate business development opportunities, including new product lines and markets.  New businesses, product lines or market activities may require methods of operations, investments and marketing and financial strategies different from those employed in our other businesses, and may also involve buyers, store customers and/or competitors different from our historical buyers, store customers and competitors.  Consumer acceptance of the new products or lines.  We may not be able to generate projected or satisfactory level of sales, profits and/or return on investment for a new business or product line, and may also encounter unanticipated events and unknown or uncertain liabilities that could materially impact our business.  We may experience possible difficulties, delays and/or unanticipated costs in integrating the business, operations, personnel and/or systems of an acquired business and may also not be able to retain and appropriately motivate key personnel of an acquired business.  We may not be able to maintain product licenses, which are subject to agreement with a variety of terms and conditions, or to enter into new licenses to enable us to launch new products and lines.  With respect to a business where we act as licensee, such as our licensed DKNY® JEANS, DKNY® ACTIVE and DKNY® MENS brands, there are a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, compliance with terms set forth in the applicable license agreements, including among other things the maintenance of certain levels of sales and the public perception and/or acceptance of the licensors brands or other product lines, which are not within our control. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within the United States and abroad. We face intense competitive challenges from other domestic and foreign fashion apparel and accessories producers and retailers. Competition is based on a number of factors, including the following:  Anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;  Establishing and maintaining favorable brand name and recognition;  Product quality;  Maintaining and growing market share;  Developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers; 25 Table of Contents  Establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with our retail customers;  Pricing products appropriately;  Providing appropriate service and support to retailers;  Optimizing our retail and supply chain capabilities;  Size and location of our retail stores and department store selling space; and  Protecting intellectual property. Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales or prices, or both, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We also believe there is an increasing focus by the department stores to concentrate an increasing portion of their product assortments within their own private label products. These private label lines compete directly with our product lines and may receive prominent positioning on the retail floor by department stores. Our reliance on independent foreign manufacturers could cause delay and loss and damage our reputation and customer relationships. Also, there are risks associated with the recently announced agreement with Li & Fung, which results in a single foreign buying agent for substantially all of our products. We do not own any product manufacturing facilities; all of our products are manufactured in accordance with our specifications through arrangements with independent suppliers. Products produced in Asia represent a substantial majority of our sales. We also source product in the United States and other regions, including several hundred suppliers, located in approximately 49 countries, manufacturing our products, with the largest finished goods supplier accounting for approximately 4.5% of the total of finished goods we purchased. A suppliers failure to manufacture and deliver products to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may drive customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us and our reputation in the marketplace. Also, a manufacturers failure to comply with safety and content regulations and standards, including with respect to childrens product and fashion jewelry, could result in substantial liability and damage to our reputation. While we provide our manufacturers with standards and we employ independent testing for safety and content issues, there can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent or detect all failures of our manufacturers to comply with such standards and regulations. We require our independent manufacturers (as well as our licensees) to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us (or any of our licensees), or the divergence of an independent manufacturers (or licensees) labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the US, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In 2008, we entered into an agreement with Hong Kong-based, global consumer goods exporter Li & Fung, whereby Li & Fung acts as the primary global apparel sourcing agent for the MEXX brand and MEXXs existing buying agent offices were integrated into the Li & Fung organization. On February 23, 2009, we entered into a long-term, exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung, pursuant to which Li & Fung will act as the primary global apparel and accessories sourcing agent for all brands in our portfolio, with the exception of the jewelry product lines. Li & Fung will continue as the primary sourcing agent for MEXX, as previously announced. Pursuant to the agreement, we will receive at closing a payment of $75 million and an additional payment of up to $8 million to offset the restructuring expenses associated with the transaction. This transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter of 2009. Going forward, we will pay to Li & Fung an agency commission based on our product purchases through Li & Fung. Our buying agent offices in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Shanghai and Shenzhen will be integrated into the Li & Fung organization. There can be no assurance that the transition with Li and Fung will be successful, and problems encountered in such transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, 26 Table of Contents financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, our agreement with Li and Fung provides for the refund of a portion of the closing payment under certain limited circumstances, including a change in control of our company, the sale or discontinuation of any of our current brands or certain termination events. Our arrangements with foreign suppliers and with our foreign sourcing agents are subject generally to the risks of doing business abroad, including currency fluctuations and revaluations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, terrorist activities, pandemic disease and, in certain parts of the world, political, economic and currency instability. Our operations have not been materially affected by any such factors to date. However, due to the very substantial portion of our products that are produced abroad, any substantial disruption of our relationships with our foreign suppliers could adversely effect our operations. Moreover, difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our suppliers, which in turn, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Our international operations are subject to a variety of legal, regulatory, political and economic risks, including risks relating to the importation and exportation of product. We source most of our products outside the US through arrangements with independent suppliers in approximately 49 countries. There are a number of risks associated with importing our products, including but not limited to the following:  The potential reimposition of quotas, which could limit the amount and type of goods that may be imported annually from a given country, in the context of a trade retaliatory case;  Changes in social, political, legal and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;  The imposition of additional regulations, or the administration of existing regulations, relating to products which are imported, exported or otherwise distributed;  The imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports;  Risks of increased sourcing costs, including costs for materials and labor, including potentially as a result of the elimination of quota on apparel products;  Our ability to adapt to and compete effectively in the current quota environment in which general quota has expired on apparel products, resulting in changing in sourcing patterns and lowered barriers to entry, but political activities which could result in the reimposition of quotas or other restrictive measures have been initiated or threatened;  Significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security considerations;  The imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special antidumping or countervailing duties; and  The enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations, or executive action affecting international textile agreements, including the United States reevaluation of the trading status of certain countries and/or retaliatory duties, quotas or other trade sanctions, which, if enacted, would increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries. Any one of these or similar factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and current business practices. Our ability to realize growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of sales in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations. These include complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets; political instability and terrorist attacks; changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and general economic fluctuations in specific countries, markets or currencies. 27 Table of Contents Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations. While we generally purchase our products in US dollars, we source most of our products overseas. As a result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies, including currency devaluations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the US dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Furthermore, our international sales represented approximately 35.5% of our total sales in fiscal 2008, such sales were derived from sales in foreign currencies, primarily the euro. Our international sales, as well as our international businesses inventory and accounts receivables levels, could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Although we hedge some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
