Risk Factors Our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price could be materially adversely affected by any or all of the following risks, or by others that we cannot identify. Risks related to the Nature of our Business ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES OR THE MEDIA IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS The Group is at risk from significant and rapid change in the legal systems, regulatory controls, and custom and practices in the countries in which it operates. These affect a wide range of areas including the composition, production, packaging, labelling, distribution and sale of the Groups products; the Groups property rights; its ability to transfer funds and assets within the Group or externally; employment practices; data protection; environment, health and safety issues; and accounting, taxation and stock exchange regulation and involve actions such as product recalls, seizure of products and other sanctions. Accordingly, changes to, or violation of, these systems, controls or practices could increase costs and have material and adverse impacts on the reputation, performance and financial condition of the Group. Political developments and changes in society, including increased scrutiny of the Group, its businesses or its industry, for example by non-governmental organisations or the media, may result in, or increase the rate of, material legal and regulatory change, and changes to custom and practices. The Group may also be subject to regulation designed to address concerns about dietary trends. This could include the introduction of additional labelling requirements, and levying additional taxes on, or restricting the production or advertising of, certain product types, which could increase the Groups costs or make it harder for the Group to market its products, adversely affecting its performance. 5 Table of Contents A FAILURE OF OUR CONTROLS IN ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS The Group is exposed to control and other risks inherent in a business which operates in many countries. A failure of control in one or more countries may materially adversely affect the performance or financial condition of the Group as a whole. Approximately one-third of the Groups confectionery revenues are generated in emerging markets, which have less developed political, legal and regulatory systems which are at higher risk of failure than those of developed markets. Any failure may have a materially adverse impact on the Groups performance or financial condition. DISRUPTION IN OUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE AND SELL PRODUCTS AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION, PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION The Group is at risk from disruption of a number of key manufacturing and distribution assets and systems on which it increasingly depends. The functioning of the Groups manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond the Groups control, including: extremes of weather or longer-term climatic changes; accidental damage; disruption to the supply of material or services; product quality and safety issues; systems failure; workforce actions; or environmental contamination. While the Group has an incident management system in place, there is a risk that these plans may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect the Groups ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect its reputation, performance or financial condition. INCREASED COMPETITION OR CONCENTRATION OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE COULD LEAD TO INCREASE PRICING PRESSURE AND DECLINING MARGINS Increased competition in the markets in which it operates may materially adversely impact the Groups performance and financial condition. The confectionery industry is highly competitive. The Group competes with other multinational corporations which also have significant financial resources. The Group may be unable to compete effectively if its competitors resources are applied to change areas of focus, enter new markets, reduce prices, or to increase investments in marketing or the development and launch of new products. The Group is also at risk from the trend towards greater concentration of its customer base due to consolidation of the retail trade which may result in increased pricing pressure from customers and adversely impact the Groups sales and margins. SHIFTS IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES Consumer demand for the Groups products may be affected by factors including changes to consumer preferences, unseasonable or unusual weather, or longer-term climatic changes. The Group has made substantial investments in understanding consumer preferences and in its ability to respond to consumer needs through innovation, and also has products appealing to a wide range of consumers. However, it may be unable to respond successfully or at reasonable cost to rapid changes in demand or consumer preferences, which may adversely affect its performance. THE KEY RAW MATERIALS THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN PRICE AND SUPPLY, AND THIS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS. The Group depends upon the availability, quality and cost of raw materials from around the world, which exposes it to price, quality and supply fluctuations, including those occurring because of the impact of disease or climate on harvests. Key raw materials include cocoa, milk, sweeteners, packaging materials and energy, some of which are available only from a limited number of suppliers. Although the Group will take measures to protect against the short-term impact of these fluctuations and of the concentration of supply, there is no guarantee that these will be effective. A failure to recover higher costs or shortfalls in availability or quality could materially adversely impact the Groups performance. BECAUSE OUR RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE FUNDED THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN VOLATILE CAPITAL MARKETS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE A SHORTFALL IN FUNDING OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION The Group is at risk from potential shortfalls in the funding of its various retirement and healthcare benefit schemes. The liabilities of these schemes reflect the Groups latest estimate of life expectancy, inflation, discount rates and salary growth which may change. These schemes are generally funded externally under trust through investments in equities, bonds and other external assets, the values of which are dependent on, among other things, the performance of equity and debt markets, which can be volatile. Changes in the value of the assets or liabilities of these schemes and therefore their funding status may require additional funding from the employing entities and may adversely impact the Groups financial condition. Risks related to our structure and processes FAILURE OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR DAY-TO-DAY BUSINESS AND DECISION MAKING PROCESSES AND HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR PERFORMANCE The Group depends on accurate, timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid day-to-day business and decision-making. Any disruption caused by failings in these systems, of underlying equipment or of communication networks could delay or otherwise impact the Groups day-to-day business and decision-making and have materially adverse effects on the Groups performance. MANY COMPONENTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER COMPONENTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY FAILURE OR OUR UNDERPERFORMANCE The Groups operations in individual countries are increasingly dependent for the proper functioning of their business on other parts of the Group in terms of raw material and product supply, new products and sales and marketing programme development, technology, funding and support services. Any underperformance or failure to control the Groups operations in one country properly could therefore impact the Groups businesses in a number of other countries and materially adversely impact the performance or financial condition of other business units or the Group as a whole. 6 Table of Contents OUR PRODUCTS COULD BECOME CONTAMINATED, WHICH COULD BE EXPENSIVE TO REMEDY, CAUSE DELAYS IN MANUFACTURING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Despite safety measures adopted by the Group, its products could become contaminated or not meet the required quality or safety standards. The Group uses many ingredients, and there is a risk of either accidental or malicious contamination. Any contamination or failure to meet quality and safety standards may be costly and impact the Groups reputation and performance. WE DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES AND WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS The Group depends on the continued contributions of its executive officers and employees, both individually and as a group. While the Group reviews its people policies on a regular basis and invests significant resources in training and development and recognising and encouraging individuals with high potential, there can be no guarantee that it will be able to attract, develop and retain these individuals at an appropriate cost and ensure that the capabilities of the Groups employees meets its business needs. Any failure to do so may impact the Groups performance. ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTY LICENSEES OF OUR BRAND AND PRODUCT RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION The Group licences to third parties certain brand and product rights in specific geographies. While such licences are carefully controlled, inappropriate action or an incident at a licensee partner could occur and impact the reputation of the Groups brands or the Group as a whole. THE FAILURE OF THIRD PARTIES TO WHOM WE HAVE OUTSOURCED BUSINESS FUNCTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION The Group is increasing its use of outsourcing arrangements with third parties, notably in information technology, manufacturing, finance and human resources operations. While the Group has benefited from the expertise of these third parties, it is at risk from failures by these third parties to deliver on their contractual commitments, which may adversely impact its reputation and performance, and increase its costs. WE DEPEND ON OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND A CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT COULD REQUIRE US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS The Group has substantial intellectual property rights and interests which are important to the Group and may require significant resources to protect and defend. The Group may also infringe others intellectual property rights and interests and therefore be required to redesign or cease the development, manufacture, use and sale of its products so that they do not infringe others intellectual property rights. This may require significant resources or not be possible. The Group may also be required to obtain licences to infringed intellectual property, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or even at all. Intellectual property litigation by or against the Group could significantly disrupt the Groups business, divert managements attention, and consume financial resources, and therefore have a materially adverse impact on the reputation, performance and financial condition of the Group. Risks related to the implementation of the Groups strategy and its change and restructuring programmes. WE CAN OFFER NO ASSURANCES REGARDING THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEPARATION OF OUR AMERICAS BEVERAGES BUSINESS The demerger of Americas Beverages may not complete on the anticipated timetable. Completion of the demerger is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of a number of conditions including, amongst others, the approval of the demerger by Cadbury Schweppes shareowners at shareowner meetings (i.e. general meeting and court meeting) and Court sanction. If the Cadbury Schweppes shareowners do not approve the Proposals at the shareowner meetings, Court sanction is not given or Americas Beverages is unable to raise sufficient finance to repay its debts to the continuing group, the demerger will not complete. If the demerger and the transactions connected with it (e.g. if it fails to repay debts post-demerger) does not occur in part or whole, then the Group may experience a delay in the execution of its strategic objectives, and may be unable to realise the benefits for shareowners that the Board believes will result from the demerger. There can be no guarantee that the Group will realise any or all of the anticipated benefits of the demerger, either in a timely manner or at all. If that happens, and the Group incurs significant costs, it could have a material adverse impact on the results of the Group. THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT THE GROUPS VISION INTO ACTION PLAN WILL DELIVER IMPROVEMENTS IN BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN MAY DISRUPT THE GROUPS BUSINESS. On 19 June 2007, the Group announced a new strategy for Confectionery called Vision into Action, which includes a plan to improve its margin performance to achieve a mid-teens operating margin by 2011. This plan includes gross reductions of approximately 15%. in the number of factories, material changes to the Groups supply chain configuration, and to the structure and operation of other Group Functions. These changes increase the risk of significant disruption to the Groups business, which may occur, for example, through defective execution of the Vision into Action plan, unforeseen events, or workforce actions. The Group expects to incur a restructuring charge of £450 million (of which around £50 million is non-cash) and invest £200 million of capital expenditure behind the Vision into Action plan. There can be no guarantee, however, that this investment, or the Groups other or subsequent investments, will deliver the anticipated improvements in business performance. RISKS INHERENT IN THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSAL OF BUSINESSES AND BRANDS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE GROUPS BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS From time to time the Group may make acquisitions and disposals of businesses and brands. While these are carefully planned, the rationale for them may be based on incorrect assumptions or conclusions and they may not realise the anticipated benefits or there may be other unanticipated or unintended effects. Additionally, while the Group seeks protection, for example through warranties and indemnities in the case of acquisitions, significant liabilities may not be identified in due diligence or come to light after the expiry of warranty or indemnity periods. These factors may materially adversely impact the performance or financial condition of the Group. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND EXCHANGE RATE RISKS ARISING FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS The main financial risks facing the Group are fluctuations in foreign currency, interest rate risk, availability of financing to meet the Groups needs and default by counterparties. Any of these financial risks may materially adversely impact the performance or financial condition of the Group. A detailed discussion of the Groups financial risks can be found in the Financial Review on pages 41 to 43. 7 Table of Contents
