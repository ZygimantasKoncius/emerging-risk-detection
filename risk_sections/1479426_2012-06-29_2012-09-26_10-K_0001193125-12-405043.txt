Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully read the risks and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could fall. Risks Related to Our Business The current adverse economic environment, including the associated impact on government budgets, could continue to adversely affect our business. In late 2008 and early 2009, the U.S. and global economies deteriorated significantly, and although the economic, financial and credit market crises have somewhat abated, they continue to contribute to market turbulence and weakness. These factors continue to impact global economic conditions, raise heightened concerns about a prolonged global economic recession and have resulted in a significant loss of corporate earnings and consumer spending. As a result, tax revenue for federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign governments, has decreased substantially. In response to the reduced revenue, governments have cut funding and may continue to cut funding to public programs, including schools and healthcare. We experienced a softening of demand, as compared to our recent historical growth rates, for both our speech generating devices and software products beginning in fiscal year 2011. Although demand improved in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 as net sales increased 21.4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we experienced less demand in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2012 as net sales decreased 9.0%, 16.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2011, respectively. We believe that reduced domestic government funding, and particularly more constrained state and local government funding of school budgets, has adversely affected our product sales in the United States during this time period. We also believe that constraints in government spending in the CompanyÂ’s key international markets, including Germany and the United Kingdom, had a similar effect on our product sales in those regions for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011. We have not seen any material improvement in the demand for both our speech generating devices and software products, and we cannot predict when such improvement might occur. The majority of the funding for purchases of our special education software and content and a significant portion of the funding for purchases of our speech generating devices comes from the budgets of public schools. Our speech generating technology business is also dependent on funding from Medicare or Medicaid or other state or local government sources. Many state and local government agencies operate under tight budget constraints and make choices on a yearly basis of where to allocate funds. If government agencies continue to redirect funds from special education programs, Medicaid programs or other disability programs to alternative projects, our net sales and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected. Changes in funding for public schools could cause the demand for our speech generating devices, special education software and content to continue to decrease. We derive a significant portion of both our speech generating devices and our special education software and content revenue from U.S. and non-U.S. public schools, which are heavily dependent on federal, state and local, as well as foreign, government funding. In addition, the school appropriations process is often slow, unpredictable and subject to many factors outside of our control. Curtailments, delays, changes in leadership, shifts in priorities or general reductions in funding could delay or reduce our revenue. Funding difficulties experienced by schools could also cause those institutions to be more resistant to price increases and could slow investments in educational products which could harm our business. Our business may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in legislation at the international, federal and state levels, changes in the state procurement process, changes in government leadership, emergence of other priorities and changes in the condition of the local, state, U.S. or 10 Table of Contents global economy. While in the past few years the availability of state and federal funding for elementary and high school education has improved due to legislation such as No Child Left Behind, recent reductions in, and proposed elimination of, appropriations for these programs may cause some school districts to continue to reduce spending on our products. Reductions in funding for U.S. and non-U.S. public schools may harm our business if our customers are not able to find and obtain alternative sources of funding. Reforms to the United States healthcare system may adversely affect our business. Significant legislative reforms to the United States healthcare system have been enacted. While we do not expect this legislation to adversely affect our business, it is not certain what form regulations or policies promulgated thereunder could take or what effect such legislation or regulations, or additional future legislative and regulatory changes may have on our business or results of operations. It is possible that such regulations or policies or future reforms could include programs to reduce spending on healthcare-related products, which may include our speech generating technologies. Changes in third-party payor funding practices or preferences for alternatives may decrease the demand for, or put downward pressure on the price of, our speech generating devices. Customers for our speech generating devices typically receive funding from various third-party payors, including domestic and foreign governmental programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate funding for our speech generating devices from domestic and foreign government and third-party payors is critical to our success. The availability and extent of coverage affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Funding varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products. After we develop a new speech generating device, we may experience limited demand for the product unless funding approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors in the United States and overseas. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, established coverage for assistive technologies to address speech impairment in 2001, and since that time most private insurers have added such coverage as well. Payors continue to review their funding polices and can, without notice, deny coverage for our speech generating devices. Additionally, many private third-party payors base their funding policy decisions on the decision reached by governmental agencies such as Medicare or Medicaid. As a result of this, if Medicare or Medicaid alters its funding policy in an unfavorable way to us, the effects could be compounded if private insurers followed suit. CMS sets coverage policy for the Medicare program in the United States. CMS policies may alter coverage and payment related to our speech generating devices in the future. These changes may occur as the result of National Coverage Decisions issued by CMS directly or as the result of local or regional coverage decisions by contractors under contract with CMS to review and make coverage and payment decisions. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 we experienced a funding shift, as an alternative payor in a certain geographic region elected to discontinue its role as primary payor for speech generating devices and assumed the role of secondary payor behind other third party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance. For fiscal year 2012 we recorded approximately $5.3 million less in net device sales as a result of the funding shift as compared to fiscal year 2011. Our expectation is that we will continue to supply a portion of patients impacted by the funding shift with devices in the future through other third party payors, which historically have averaged between three and six months for final authorization compared to approximately 30 days for this specific alternative payor and which may have different reimbursement guidelines than this specific alternative payor. If we experience other funding shifts, our net device sales may be adversely affected. Legislative or administrative changes could reduce the availability of third-party funding for our speech generating devices. Legislative or administrative changes to the U.S. or international funding systems that significantly reduce funding for our products or deny coverage for our products would have an adverse impact on the number of 11 Table of Contents products purchased by our customers and the prices our customers are willing to pay for them, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of members of our senior management or other key personnel or the failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our growth strategy. We rely on members of our senior management to execute our existing business plans and to identify and pursue new opportunities. The loss of services of one or more of our key senior managers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical, development, sales, marketing and services personnel. We rely on our technical and development personnel for product innovation. We rely on our sales and marketing personnel to continue to expand awareness of our products and our customer base. The loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be costly and time consuming, could cause additional disruptions to our business, and could be unsuccessful. We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our employees. Our future success also depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, development, sales and services personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may fail to retain our key employees or attract or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. We may not be able to develop and market successful new products. Our future success and our ability to increase net sales and earnings depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market new software, devices and content. Our failure to develop new products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our new products do not work as planned, our ability to market these products could be substantially impeded, resulting in lost net sales, potential damage to our reputation and delays in obtaining market acceptance of these products. We cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully develop and market new products. New disruptive technologies may adversely affect our market position and financial results. Our competitors or companies in related industries could develop new technologies that may reduce our market share and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. For example, other companies are seeking to develop technologies to allow a computer to be directly controlled by a human brain. If a competitor is able to commercialize that technology before we are, our sales of speech generating devices for people with significant physical limitations may be reduced. Also, speech generation software applications utilized on hand-held tablet computers not specifically designed for this purpose may become more popular and adversely affect sales of our speech generating devices. Schools may also direct a higher percentage of their annual operating budgets to the purchase of hand-held tablet computers and the wireless infrastructure required to support them which could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. We are dependent on the continued support of speech language pathologists and special education teachers. The majority of our speech generating technologies sales are made at the recommendation of a speech language pathologist, and the majority of our special education software authoring tools and content are sold to special education teachers. We are dependent on our ability to convince speech language pathologists and special education teachers of the benefits to their clients and students of our speech generating technologies and special education software. If speech language pathologists or special education teachers were to instead favor the products of our competitors, damaging our reputation, we could lose market share, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 12 Table of Contents Our products are dependent on the continued success of our proprietary symbol sets. Our proprietary symbol sets are important components of both our speech generating technologies and our special education software. Using symbols rather than text makes communication more efficient and more broadly accessible to people with a wide range of cognitive abilities. While we believe that our proprietary symbol sets include the most widely used set of graphic symbols utilized in speech generating technology and special education software, if speech language pathologists or our clients begin to prefer an alternate symbol set (because, for example, they determine that an alternate symbol set is easier to learn or more efficient than our proprietary symbol sets) or if a superior symbol set is developed by one of our competitors, we could lose market share in both our speech generating technologies and special education software, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend upon certain third-party suppliers and licensing arrangements, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations, which could harm our business. We currently rely on third-party suppliers for the components of our speech generating devices. In some cases, there are relatively few alternate sources of supply for certain other components that are necessary for the hardware components of our speech generating devices. Our reliance on these outside suppliers also subjects us to risks that could harm our business, including: Â• we may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms; Â• we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternate suppliers; Â• our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for the products those suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components to us in a timely manner; Â• our suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements; Â• any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products; and Â• defective parts and products from these suppliers could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation. Some of the software and other intellectual property that is incorporated into our products is owned by third parties and licensed by us. We may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the third-party intellectual property may not be appropriately supported or maintained by the licensors. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use third-party intellectual property in our products and services it could result in increased costs, or an inability to develop new products. If our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably. Patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends on the proprietary nature of our technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovations to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. However, any pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, any current or future patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and the rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us or prevent other companies from independently 13 Table of Contents developing technology that is similar to ours or introducing competitive products. In addition, our pending trademark registration applications may not be approved by the applicable governmental authorities and, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. Failure to obtain trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. Although our proprietary symbol sets are protected by certain trademarks and copyrights, a third party could seek to utilize our symbol sets without our authorization. Furthermore, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our intellectual property, or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time-consuming to us and could divert the attention of management, and such actions may not be successful. The invalidation or circumvention of key copyrights, patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights which we own or unsuccessful outcomes in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more directly with us, which could adversely affect our competitive position and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products. Third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their intellectual property rights. If such claims are successful, we may have to pay substantial damages for past infringement. We might also be prohibited from selling our products or providing certain content or devices without first obtaining a license from the third party, which, if available at all, may require us to pay royalties. Moreover, we may need to redesign some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. The market opportunities for our products and content may not be as large as we believe. Our business strategy is to grow our sales to satisfy unmet demand for our speech generating devices among non-verbal individuals and for our special education authoring tools and content among special education teachers. Our expectations for future growth are dependent on our estimates of the number of people who can benefit from our speech generating technologies and special education software and the future growth in conditions that lead to speech and cognitive impairment, such as strokes and autism. However, these market opportunities for our products may not be as large as we believe and may not develop as expected. For example, although the sales of our speech generating devices could grow faster than we expect if our strategy to expand the scale, reach and sophistication of our direct sales infrastructure and build awareness of our products among potential end users and speech language pathologists is more effective than we have modeled, these sales could also be adversely impacted to the extent that these strategies are less effective than we expect, if the population of potential users does not develop as we anticipate or if some portion of the pool of potential end users that we seek to serve decides to use speech generation software applications on devices not specifically designed for this purpose, such as hand-held tablet computers. We may fail to successfully execute our strategy to grow our business. We intend to pursue a number of different strategies to grow our revenue and earnings. However, we may not be able to successfully execute these strategies. 14 Table of Contents We may attempt to pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances, which may be unsuccessful. We may attempt to achieve our business objectives through acquisitions and strategic alliances. We compete with other companies for these opportunities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect acquisitions or strategic alliances on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we enter into these transactions, we may experience, among other things: Â• difficulties in integrating any acquired companies and products into our existing business; Â• inability to realize the benefits we anticipate in a timely fashion, or at all; Â• attrition of key personnel from acquired businesses; Â• significant costs, charges or writedowns; or Â• unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations. Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions which would dilute our then existing stockholders. We are subject to a variety of risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results. Our operations in countries outside the United States, which accounted for 11.5% of our net sales for the year ended June 29, 2012, are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the United States, which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations. Our profitability and international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: Â• changes in foreign medical reimbursement programs and policies, Â• local product preferences and product requirements, Â• longer-term receivables than are typical in the United States, Â• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, Â• less protection of intellectual property in some countries outside the United States, Â• trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements, Â• work force instability, Â• dependence on third party distributors, Â• international terrorism and anti-American sentiment, Â• political and economic instability, and Â• the potential payment of U.S. income taxes on certain earnings of our foreign subsidiariesÂ’ upon repatriation. Our sales in international markets are also heavily dependent on public funding. We experienced a softening of demand for our products in international markets, including Germany and the United Kingdom, in fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012 that we believe was as a result of constraints in government spending. Continued or increases in constraints in public funding for our products in our key international markets could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. 15 Table of Contents In addition, our business practices in foreign countries are subject to compliance with U.S. law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Â“FCPAÂ”). We have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of the FCPA and other U.S. laws. If violations were to occur, they could subject us to fines and other penalties as well as increased compliance costs. In addition, a significant amount of trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries. Repayment is accordingly dependent to a degree upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries. We depend on third-party distributors to market and sell our products internationally in a number of markets. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by both our distributorsÂ’ performance and our ability to maintain these relationships on terms that are favorable to us. We depend, in part, on international third-party distributors to sell our products in many jurisdictions outside the United States. In the fiscal year ended June 29, 2012, our net sales through international third-party distributors were 6% of our total net sales. Our international distributors operate independently of us, and we have limited control over their operations, which exposes us to certain risks. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products and may also market and sell competitive products. In addition, our distributors may not comply with the laws and regulatory requirements in their local jurisdictions, which may limit their ability to market or sell our products. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to locate competent distributors in particular countries and secure their services on favorable terms, or at all, we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of net sales in these markets or enter new markets, and we may not realize our expected international growth. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions could prevent us from marketing our products abroad. We have commercial and marketing efforts in a number of international jurisdictions and may seek to market our products in new countries in the future. Outside the United States, we can generally market a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and, in some cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The approval procedure varies among countries. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries. Our business could be adversely affected by competition including potential new entrants. Although we have few competitors in our specific areas of speech generating technology and special education software, many other companies compete within the broader assistive technology market and could choose to enter the areas in which we have chosen to focus. We also face the risk of new entrants who do not currently compete in any segment of the assistive technology market, whether through acquisition of a current competitor or a new startup from a company that engages in a complementary business to ours, such as producers of educational software or consumer electronics. These competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs, larger facilities than ours, as well as global distribution channels that may be more effective than ours. These competitors may develop new technologies or more effective products that would compete directly with our products. These new technologies may make it more difficult to market our products and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Competing with these companies will require continued investment by us in research and development, marketing, customer service and support. Even with such continued investments, we may not be able to successfully compete with new entrants in the areas in which we compete. If we fail to comply with the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state and foreign laws, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs. A provision of the U.S. Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, 16 Table of Contents ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations. In addition, most of the states in which our products are sold in the United States have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these laws are even broader than the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute in that their prohibitions are not limited to items or services paid for by a federal healthcare program but, instead, apply regardless of the source of payment. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or such similar state laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs. We derive a significant portion of our net sales from international operations, and many foreign governments have equivalent statutes with similar penalties. All of our financial relationships with healthcare providers and others who provide products or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries are potentially governed by the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state or foreign laws. We believe our operations are in material compliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state or foreign laws. However, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws, which could be time-consuming and costly to us, could divert managementÂ’s attention from operating our business and could prevent healthcare providers from purchasing our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if our arrangements were found to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state or foreign laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we fail to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), we could be subject to enforcement actions. Federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. In particular, in April 2003, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published patient privacy rules under HIPAA and, in April 2005, published security rules for protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security rules govern the use, disclosure and security of protected health information by Â“Covered Entities,Â” which are healthcare providers that submit electronic claims, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. Through our sales of speech generating technologies, we are a Covered Entity. We are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of patientsÂ’ health information and believe that we meet the expectations of the HIPAA rules. While we believe we are and will be in compliance with all HIPAA standards, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to enforcement actions, which can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. Governmental compliance is critical to the operation of our business. As legislators and regulatory bodies increase scrutiny of our industry, there may be adverse statements or charges against us by regulators or elected officials. Regardless of the factual basis, such allegations can result in investigation by regulators, legislators, and law enforcement officials, or in lawsuits. Responding to such allegations can be costly and time consuming. Adverse publicity can have a negative impact on our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and the results of operations. New regulations related to Â“conflict mineralsÂ” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals (Â“conflict mineralsÂ”) that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The new rule will require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain 17 Table of Contents minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Cyber attacks as well as improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is dependent upon our computer technologies, systems and platforms. Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our business and impede our ability to provide services to our clients, thereby subjecting us to liability. Additionally, our business involves the use and storage of information about our employees and our customers. While we take measures to protect the security and the privacy of personal and proprietary information, it is possible that our security controls over our systems, as well as other security practices we follow, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or proprietary information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure DynaVox Inc.Â’s only material asset is its interest in DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC, and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions from DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement or pay dividends. DynaVox Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of partnership units of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC, or Holdings Units. DynaVox Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. DynaVox Inc. intends to cause DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC to make distributions to its unitholders in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, payments under the tax receivable agreement and dividends, if any, declared by it. To the extent that DynaVox Inc. needs funds, and DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. DynaVox Systems LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC, has entered into a senior secured credit facility. This agreement includes a restricted payment covenant, which restricts the ability of DynaVox Systems LLC to make distributions to its parent, DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC, which, in turn, limits the ability of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC to make distributions to DynaVox Inc. In addition, each of DynaVox Systems LLC and DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC are generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of the limited liability company (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. DynaVox Inc. is controlled by the limited partners of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC, whose interests may differ from those of our public shareholders. As of June 29, 2012, the limited partners of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC controlled approximately 63.0% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. Accordingly, the limited partners of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors, and thereby to control our management and affairs. In addition, they are able to determine the outcome 18 Table of Contents of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and are able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, as of June 29, 2012, the limited partners of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC owned 63.0% of the Holdings Units. Because they hold their ownership interest in our business through DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC, rather than through the public company, these owners may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, these owners may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement that we entered in connection with our IPO, and whether and when DynaVox Inc. should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these ownersÂ’ tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See Â“Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.Â” Prior to our IPO, DynaVox Inc. and DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC entered into an amended and restated securityholders agreement with funds affiliated with Vestar Capital Partners (or, together with its affiliates, Vestar), Park Avenue Equity Partners L.P. (or, together with its affiliates, Park Avenue) and certain specified other holders of Holdings Units from time to time, including our executive officers. The amended and restated securityholders agreement includes, until such time as the securityholders cease to own at least 25% of the total voting power of DynaVox Inc., a voting agreement pursuant to which the securityholders have agreed to vote their shares and to take any other action necessary to elect the following directors of DynaVox Inc.: (1) one director who shall be the Chief Executive Officer and (2) for so long as Vestar holds 10% of the total voting power of DynaVox Inc., all of the remaining directors shall be designated by Vestar. In addition, the amended and restated securityholders agreement provides Vestar with certain Â“take alongÂ” rights, requiring the other investors party to that agreement to consent to a proposed sale of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC. These provisions give Vestar substantial control over the Company, and VestarÂ’s interests may differ with your interests as a holder of the Class A common stock. See Â“Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.Â” As of June 29, 2012, parties to the amended and restated security holders agreement controlled approximately 57.9% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock and held 57.9% of the Holdings Units. Our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by Vestar. Vestar and its affiliates are in the business of providing buyout capital and growth capital to developing companies, and may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Our certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us, on the one hand, and Vestar, on the other hand. As set forth in our certificate of incorporation, neither Vestar, nor any director, officer, stockholder, member, manager or employee of Vestar has any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Therefore, a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director, officer, member, manager or employee of Vestar may pursue certain acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by Vestar to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us. 19 Table of Contents We are a Â“controlled companyÂ” within the meaning of the NASDAQ Global Select Market rules. As a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. The parties to our amended and restated securityholders agreement continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock. As a result, we are a Â“controlled companyÂ” within the meaning of the NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance standards. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a Â“controlled companyÂ” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, including a majority independent board of directors and independent director oversight of executive officer compensation and director nominations. We rely on these exemptions and, as a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We will be required to pay the counterparties to the tax receivable agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim arising in connection with our IPO, future purchases or exchanges of Holdings Units and related transactions, and the amounts we may pay could be significant. In connection with our IPO, we purchased Holdings Units from our pre-IPO owners, including members of our senior management. We also entered into a tax receivable agreement with our pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by DynaVox Inc. to these parties of 85% of the benefits, if any, that DynaVox Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of (i) the existing tax basis in the intangible assets of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC on the date of our IPO, (ii) the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of Holdings Units and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. See Â“Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.Â” We expect that the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and/or distributions to DynaVox Inc. by DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC are not sufficient to permit DynaVox Inc. to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after it has paid taxes. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon the continued ownership of us by the counterparties to the tax receivable agreement. In certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement. The tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, the corporate taxpayerÂ’s (or its successorÂ’s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired Holdings Units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including that the corporate taxpayer would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. Upon a subsequent actual exchange, any additional increase in tax deductions, tax basis and other benefits in excess of the amounts assumed at the change in control will also result in payments under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we realize. Moreover, if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement early (including in connection with or following a change of control), we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value (calculated utilizing a discount rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points) of the anticipated future tax benefits. In addition to the assumption that the corporate taxpayer would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions 20 Table of Contents arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits, this upfront payment would be calculated based upon additional assumptions, including that any Holdings Units that had not then been exchanged would be deemed to be exchanged for the market value of the Class A common stock at the time of the termination and that the tax rates for future years would be those specified in the law as in effect at the time of termination. In any of these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could be significant and significantly in excess of any tax benefits that we realize. Payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase, the corporate taxpayer will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the benefits that the corporate taxpayer actually realizes in respect of (i) the existing tax basis in the intangible assets of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC on the date of our IPO, (ii) the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of Holdings Units and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. Our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks. As of June 29, 2012, we had an aggregate of $31.2 million of long-term debt outstanding (including current installments), which consisted entirely of borrowings under our $52.0 million term loan. As of June 29, 2012, we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Accordingly, we are exposed to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage. Increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities, or to make necessary capital expenditures. The existing senior secured credit agreement contains covenant restrictions that limit our ability to conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our ability to maintain our compliance with these covenants is dependent upon our financial performance, which is influenced by a number of factors, including the levels of government funding in the U.S. and key international markets. Violation of any of these covenants would result in an event of default under the credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, including in the event of non-compliance with the financial ratios required under the existing senior credit agreement, the lenders would have the ability to accelerate all amounts then outstanding under the credit facility, except that, upon bankruptcy and insolvency events of default, such acceleration is automatic. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an event of default under the credit facility, we would no longer have access to our revolving credit facility and we would have to reclassify on our balance sheet amounts currently shown as long-term debt under the 2008 Credit Facility to short-term debt. Under these circumstances, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. A substantial portion of our cash flow could be required for debt service and, as a result, might not be available for our operations or other purpose. Any substantial decrease in cash flows or any substantial increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements or force us to modify our operations. Our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business, regulatory and economic conditions. For a more detailed discussion of our senior secured credit facility, see Â“Item 7. ManagementÂ’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsÂ—Liquidity and Capital ResourcesÂ—Financing Agreements.Â” This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an independent registered public accounting firmÂ’s audit of our internal control over financial reporting. Under rules established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, specifically subsection (c)Â—Exemption for Smaller Issuers, under Section 989GÂ—Exemption for 21 Table of Contents Non-accelerated Filers, the Company is not required to obtain, and therefore did not obtain, an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. Because we have not yet engaged an independent registered public accounting firm to conduct an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot conclude that such an audit would not uncover a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls. If in the future we are required to conduct an audit of our internal control over financial reporting and such audit findings conclude that we have a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls, our management may not be able to certify as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting. Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules, and result in a breach of the covenants under our debt agreements. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions: Â• authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class A common stock; Â• prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; Â• provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and Â• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. Risks Related to our Class A Common Stock Shares of our Class A common stock price may decline due to the large number of shares of Class A common stock eligible for future sale and for exchange. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of Class A common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 22 Table of Contents If the market price of our common stock is not quoted on a national exchange, the market price of our common stock and our reputation may be negatively impacted. Since August 20, 2012, the minimum closing bid price of our common stock has been less than $1.00 per share. If we are unable to meet the stock price listing requirements of NASDAQ, including the requirement that our consolidated closing bid price not be below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ may issues a deficiency notice providing a 180 day compliance period prior to our common stock being subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. If our common stock were delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, among other things, this could result in a number of negative implications, including reduced price and liquidity in our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with NASDAQ and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws, as well as the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, the loss of the ability to raise future capital, less coverage by analysts, fewer business development opportunities and greater difficulty in obtaining financing. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock, if any, may be your only source of gain on an investment in our Class A common stock. Even if we decide in the future to pay any dividends, DynaVox Inc. is a holding company with no independent operations of its own. As a result, DynaVox Inc. depends on DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates for cash to pay its obligations and make dividend payments. Deterioration in the financial conditions, earnings or cash flow of DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay cash distributions or other distributions to us. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent upon our receipt of cash from DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries. DynaVox Systems Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries may be restricted from sending cash to us by, among other things, law or provisions of the documents governing our existing or future indebtedness. If securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who covers us downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, including as a result of a possible delisting of our Class A common stock, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our Class A common stock price or trading volume to decline and our Class A common stock to be less liquid. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline. The market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, if any, to stockholders, additions or departures of key 23 Table of Contents management personnel, failure to meet analystsÂ’ earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals, the delisting of our shares of Class A common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and in response the market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of Class A common stock at or above the price you originally paid. In the past years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companyÂ’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managementÂ’s attention and resources. You may be diluted by the future issuance of additional Class A common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise. As of June 29, 2012, we have an aggregate of more than 988 million shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including approximately 18.8 million shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of outstanding Holdings Units. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We have reserved 3,550,000 shares for issuance under our 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, including 1,358,550 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options that we have granted to our officers and employees. See Â“Item 11. Executive CompensationÂ”. Any Class A common stock that we issue, including under our 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by the then existing holders of our Class A common stock.
