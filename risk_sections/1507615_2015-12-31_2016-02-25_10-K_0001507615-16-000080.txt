ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSLimited partner interests are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business. If any of the following risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and our cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, we might not be able to pay distributions on our common units or the trading price of our common units could decline.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSOur operations and Tesoro’s refining operations are subject to many risks and operational hazards, which may result in business interruptions and shutdowns of our or Tesoro’s facilities and damages for which we may not be fully covered by insurance. If a significant accident or event results in a business interruption or shutdown, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Our operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting and storing crude oil and refined products, as well as the gathering, processing and treating of natural gas and the fractionation of NGLs, including:•damages to pipelines, plants and facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes, floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism;•mechanical or structural failures on our pipelines, at our facilities or at third-party facilities on which our operations are dependent, including Tesoro’s facilities;•leaks or losses of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs, refined products and other hydrocarbons or other regulated substances as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;•curtailments of operations relative to severe seasonal weather;•damage to pipelines and other assets from construction, farm and utility equipment;•damage to third-party property or persons, including injury or death;•ruptures, fires and explosions; and•other hazards.18Table of ContentsThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage, as well as business interruptions or shutdowns of our facilities. Any such event or unplanned shutdown could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Tesoro’s refining operations, on which our operations are substantially dependent, are subject to similar operational hazards and risks inherent in refining crude oil.A significant portion of our operating responsibility also requires us to insure the quality and purity of the products loaded at our terminals and pipeline connections. If our quality control measures fail, we may have contaminated or off-specification commingled pipelines and storage tanks or off-specification product could be sent to public gas stations and other end users. These types of incidents could result in product liability claims from our customers or other pipelines to which our pipelines connect. There can be no assurance that product liability against us would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or our ability to maintain existing customers or retain new customers.Our current insurance coverage does not insure against all potential losses, and we could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by an insurer to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.A material decrease in our customers’ profitability could materially reduce the volumes of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and NGLs that we handle, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.The volume of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and NGLs that we distribute and store at our terminals, transport and process depends substantially on Tesoro’s and other customers’ profit margins, the market price of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and other refinery feedstocks, and product demand. These prices are impacted by numerous factors beyond our control or the control of Tesoro and other third-party customers. Such factors include product margins and the global supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs, gasoline and other refined products.A material decrease in the crude oil or natural gas produced in the midwestern United States area could materially reduce the volume of crude oil gathered and transported by our High Plains System or the volume of natural gas gathered, processed, transported and fractionated by our Rockies assets.The volume of crude oil that we gather and transport on our High Plains System in excess of committed volumes depends on demand for crude oil. This depends, in part, on the availability of attractively-priced, high-quality crude oil produced in the Bakken Region. Similarly, the volume of natural gas that we gather, process, and transport, and the volume of NGLs that we fractionate in our Rockies assets depends on the volume of natural gas and NGLs produced in the Green River, Uinta and Williston basins. Adverse developments in these regions could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows than those of our competitors because of our lack of geographic diversity and substantial reliance on several major customers. Accordingly, in addition to general industry risks related to these operations, we may be disproportionately exposed to risks in the area, including:•the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials;•the availability of drilling rigs for producers;•weather-related curtailment of operations by producers and disruptions to truck gathering operations;•the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including regulations related to the exploration, production and transportation of shale oil and natural gas, including hydraulic fracturing and natural gas flaring and rail transportation;•the development of third-party crude oil or natural gas gathering systems that could impact the price and availability of crude oil or natural gas in these areas; and•the anticipated future prices of crude oil, refined products, NGLs and natural gas in surrounding markets.If as a result of any of these or other factors, the volume of crude oil, natural gas or NGLs available in these regions is materially reduced for a prolonged period of time, the volume of our throughputs and the related fees, could be materially reduced. In addition, the construction by third parties of new pipelines in areas in which we own or acquire rail loading or unloading facilities could impact the ability of our rail facilities to remain competitive, resulting in reduced throughput and fees.19Table of ContentsIf third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities connected to our crude oil, refined products, natural gas gathering or transportation systems become partially or fully unavailable, or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the quality specifications of such pipelines or facilities, our business, results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely effected.Our crude oil, refined products, natural gas gathering, processing and transportation systems connect to other pipelines or facilities owned and operated by third parties, such as the Kern River Gas Transmission Company Pipeline, the Northwest Pipeline, the Rockies Express Pipeline, Mid-America Pipeline and others. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines and other midstream facilities is not within our control. These pipelines and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, weather damage, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or other operational issues. In addition, if our costs to access and transport on these third-party pipelines significantly increase, our profitability could be reduced. If any such increase in cost occurs, if any of these pipelines or other midstream facilities become unable to receive, transport or process the products, or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business, and the failure of any critical information system, including a cyber-security breach, may result in harm to our business.We are heavily dependent on technology infrastructure and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include data networks, telecommunications, cloud-based information controls, software applications and hardware, including those that are critical to the operation of our pipelines, terminals, processing facilities and other operations. Our technology infrastructure and information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks, employee error or malfeasances and other events. However, no cybersecurity or emergency recovery processes is failsafe, and if our safeguards fail or our data or technology infrastructure is compromised, the safety and efficiency of our operations could be materially harmed, our reputation could suffer, and we could be subject us to additional costs, liabilities, and costly legal challenges, including those involving privacy of customer data. Finally, federal legislation relating to cyber-security threats could impose additional requirements on our operations.Our business is impacted by environmental risks inherent in our operations.Our operation of crude oil, refined products and natural gas pipelines, terminals and storage facilities is inherently subject to the risks of spills, discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or other hazardous substances. For example, in September 2013, we responded to a crude oil pipeline release of approximately 20,000 barrels in a rural field northeast of Tioga, North Dakota. Other spills, discharges and inadvertent releases may have previously occurred or occur in the future; such releases may have been or be in connection with Tesoro’s refineries, our pipelines, our terminals and facilities, or any other facility to which we send or have sent wastes or by-products for treatment or disposal. In any such incident, we could be liable for costs and penalties associated with the remediation of such facilities under federal, state and local environmental laws or the common law. We may also be liable for personal injury or property damage claims from third parties alleging contamination from spills or releases from our facilities or operations.With respect to assets that we acquired from Tesoro, our indemnification for certain environmental liabilities under the Amended Omnibus Agreement and the Carson Assets Indemnity Agreement with Tesoro is generally limited to liabilities identified prior to the earlier of the date that Tesoro no longer controls our general partner or five years after the date of purchase. Even if we are insured or indemnified against environmental risks, we may be responsible for costs or penalties to the extent our insurers or indemnitors do not fulfill their obligations to us. The payment of such costs or penalties could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change legislation or regulation reducing emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur significant costs or could result in a decrease in demand for crude oil, refined products, natural gas and NGLs, which could adversely affect our business.Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address reporting or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. Requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could cause us to incur substantial costs to (1) operate and maintain our facilities, (2) install new emission controls at our facilities and (3) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including the acquisition or maintenance of emission credits or allowances. These requirements may also adversely affect the refinery, gas production and other operations of Tesoro and our other customers, leading to an indirect adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.20Table of ContentsIn California, Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”), created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. AB 32 focuses on using market mechanisms, such as a cap-and-trade program and a low carbon fuel standard to achieve emission reduction targets, requiring a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. Litigation and appeals related to the constitutionality and enforceability of AB 32 continue and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. In addition, the implementation and implications of AB 32 will take many years to realize.Requiring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the increased use of renewable fuels could decrease demand for refined products, which could have an indirect, but material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the EPA has promulgated rules establishing greenhouse gas emission standards for new-model passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium duty passenger vehicles. These requirements, or new taxes or fees imposed on crude oil, natural gas or refined products to fund clean energy initiatives at the state or federal level, could have an indirect adverse effect on our business due to reduced demand for crude oil, refined products, natural gas and NGLs.Our assets and operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and safety that could require us to make substantial expenditures.Our assets and operations involve the transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products, as well as the gathering, conditioning, processing and treating of natural gas and the fractionation of NGLs, which are subject to increasingly stringent and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment and operational safety matters. Our business involves the risk that crude oil, refined products, natural gas, NGLs and other hydrocarbons may gradually or suddenly be released into the environment. We also own or lease a number of properties that have been used to gather, transport, store or distribute natural gas, produced water, crude oil and refined products for many years, and many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose handling, disposal, or release of hydrocarbons and other wastes were not under our control. Our sites, including storage tanks, wharf and dock operations, pipelines, processing plants, dehydrators, compressor stations and facility loading racks are also subject to federal, state and local restrictions on air emissions. We may be required to address the release of regulated substances into the environment or other conditions discovered in the future that require environmental response actions or remediation. To the extent not covered by insurance or an indemnity, responding to such conditions may cause us to incur potentially material expenditures for response actions, for government penalties, for claims for damages to natural resources, for personal injury or property damage claims from third parties and for business interruption.Transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over or under water or proximate to navigable or environmentally sensitive bodies of water occurs at many of our facilities. Such activity involves inherent risks and subjects us to the provisions of OPA 90 or similar state environmental laws. To meet the requirements of these laws, we have contracts with Tesoro, who contracts with third parties to provide coverage in the areas in which we transport or store crude oil and refined products; however, these companies may not be able to adequately contain a worst case discharge, being a spill of up to 125,000 barrels of crude oil from an above ground storage tank adjacent to water, and we cannot ensure that all of their services would be available for our or Tesoro’s use at any given time. There are many factors that could inhibit the availability of these service providers, including weather conditions, governmental regulations and other global events that they may be required to respond to by state or federal ruling. In these and other cases, we may be subject to liability in connection with the discharge of crude oil, natural gas, or refined products into navigable waters.Our business activities are subject to increasingly strict federal, state, and local laws and regulations that require our pipelines, compressor stations, terminals, processing complexes, fractionation plants and storage facilities to comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements regarding the design, installation, testing, construction, and operational management of our facilities. We could incur potentially significant additional expenses if any of our assets were found to be non-compliant. Additional proposals and proceedings that impact our industry are regularly considered by Congress, as well as by state legislatures and federal and state regulatory commissions and agencies and courts. Any future environmental, health and safety requirements or changed interpretations of existing requirements may impose more stringent requirements on our assets and operations, which may require us to incur potentially material expenditures to ensure continued compliance. The violation of such requirements could subject us to the possibility of higher administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities, and the issuance of injunctions that may limit our operations, subject us to additional operational constraints or prevent or delay construction of additional facilities or equipment. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.21Table of ContentsOur expansion of existing assets and construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and will be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.We continue to evaluate opportunities for organic expansion projects and the construction of additional assets, such as our recently completed Connolly Gathering System and High Plains Pipeline reversal project. The construction of a new pipeline, processing plant or terminal or the expansion of an existing pipeline, processing plant or terminal involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. Construction is also impacted by the availability of specialized contractors and laborers and the price and demand for materials. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, we may not receive sufficient long-term contractual commitments from customers to provide the revenue needed to support such projects and we may be unable to negotiate acceptable interconnection agreements with third-party pipelines to provide destinations for increased throughput. Even if we receive such commitments or make such interconnections, we may not realize an increase in revenue for an extended period of time. We may also construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize, resulting in less than anticipated throughput and a failure to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.We may not be able to significantly increase our third-party revenue due to competition and other factors, which could limit our ability to continue our growth and may extend our dependence on Tesoro and other major customers.Our ability to increase our non-Tesoro third-party revenue is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including competition from other logistics providers, and the extent to which we have available capacity when potential customers require it. For example, our High Plains System may be unable to compete effectively with existing and future third-party crude oil gathering systems and trucking operations in the Bakken Region. Our ability to obtain third-party customers on our High Plains System is also dependent on our ability to make further inlet connections from and outlet connections to third-party facilities and pipelines. There are also competitors in the area of our natural gas gathering and processing facilities, and we may be unable to compete effectively in obtaining new supplies of gas for these operations.In addition, part of our strategy includes diversifying our customer base by identifying opportunities to offer services to new customers. Our two largest customers accounted for 71% of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to attract material third-party service opportunities. Our efforts to attract new customers may be adversely affected by our relationship with Tesoro, our desire to provide services pursuant to fee-based contracts and Tesoro’s operational requirements with respect to our assets. Our potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements, under which we could be required to assume direct commodity exposure.If we are unable to complete acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or within anticipated timeframes from Tesoro or third parties, our future growth will be limited, and any acquisitions we make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash flows and ability to make distributions to unitholders.A portion of our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in distributable cash flow. The acquisition component of our growth strategy is based, in large part, on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets by industry participants, including Tesoro. If we are unable to make acquisitions from Tesoro or third parties because (1) there is a material decrease in divestitures of gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets, (2) we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, (3) we are unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, (4) we are unsuccessful in our bid against competing potential purchasers, or (5) for any other reason, our ability to grow our operations and increase cash distributions to our unitholders will be limited. Even if we do consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in distributable cash flow as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions or unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. Additionally, regulatory agencies could require us to divest certain of our assets in order to consummate future acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate any of our expected acquisitions within our desired timeframes or at all. Furthermore, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.22Table of ContentsOur right of first offer to acquire certain of Tesoro’s existing assets is subject to risks and uncertainty, and ultimately we may not acquire any of those assets. In addition, we may not be able to acquire other assets that Tesoro has said it may offer to us in the future for acquisition.Our Amended Omnibus Agreement provides us with a right of first offer on certain of Tesoro’s existing logistics assets for a period of ten years after the closing of our initial public offering. The consummation and timing of any future acquisitions of these assets will depend upon, among other things, Tesoro’s willingness to offer these assets for sale, our ability to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements and commercial agreements with respect to the assets and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate any future acquisitions pursuant to our right of first offer, and Tesoro is under no obligation to accept any offer that we may choose to make. In addition, certain of the assets covered by our right of first offer may require substantial capital expenditures in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or otherwise make them suitable for our commercial needs. For these or a variety of other reasons, we may decide not to exercise our right of first offer if and when any assets are offered for sale, and our decision will not be subject to unitholder approval. In addition, our right of first offer may be terminated by Tesoro at any time after it no longer controls our general partner.In addition to the assets with respect to which we have a right of first offer, Tesoro has sold to us additional logistics assets that it developed or acquired from third parties, such as the Anacortes Rail Facility, the Los Angeles Terminal Assets, the Los Angeles Logistics Assets and the LA Storage and Handling Assets. Tesoro has identified additional logistics projects as potential opportunities for acquisition by us after they are developed, including a joint venture to develop a rail-to-marine terminal in Vancouver, Washington. Tesoro closed its acquisition of logistical assets in the Williston Basin of North Dakota on January 11, 2016 and expects to acquire Flint Hills Resources’ marketing and logistic assets in Alaska in the first half of 2016. However, we cannot provide assurance of Tesoro’s continued willingness to offer these assets for sale, our ability to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements and commercial agreements with respect to the assets or our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms.Our natural gas gathering systems are subject to state regulation that could materially and adversely affect our operations and cash flows.In addition to safety and environmental regulations, certain of our natural gas gathering facilities are also subject to non-discriminatory take requirements and complaint-based state regulation with respect to rates and terms and conditions of service. State and local regulation may cause us to incur additional costs or limit our operations and may prevent us from choosing the customers to which we provide service, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our operations and revenue.Pipeline rate regulation, changes to pipeline rate-making rules, or a successful challenge to the pipeline rates we charge may reduce our revenues and the amount of cash we generate.The FERC regulates the tariff rates for interstate movements and state regulatory authorities regulate the tariff rates for intrastate movements on our crude oil, refined product, natural gas, and NGL pipeline systems. The regulatory agencies periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for our services.The FERC’s primary rate-making methodology is currently price-indexing; if the methodology changes, the new methodology could result in tariffs that generate lower revenues and cash flow. The indexing method allows a pipeline to increase its rates based on a percentage change in the producer price index for finished goods and is not based on pipeline-specific costs. If the index falls, we will be required to reduce our rates that are based on the FERC’s price indexing methodology if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate. In addition, changes in the index might not be large enough to fully reflect actual increases in our costs. The FERC’s rate-making methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our true costs or may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.23Table of ContentsIf a party with an economic interest were to file either a protest of our proposal for increased rates or a complaint against our existing tariff rates, or the if FERC or a State regulatory agency were to initiate an investigation of our existing rates, then our rates could be subject to detailed review. Tesoro has agreed not to challenge, or to cause others to challenge or assist others in challenging, our High Plains Pipeline tariff rates in effect during the respective terms of our High Plains Pipeline Transportation Services Agreements for both interstate rates and intrastate rates in North Dakota. We have similar provisions in certain other Transportation Services Agreements entered into with Tesoro and third-party shippers providing for committed interstate shipments on our High Plains System pursuant to FERC open season orders. These agreements do not prevent other current or future shippers from challenging our tariff rates. If our proposed rate increases were found to be in excess of levels justified by our cost of service, the FERC or a State regulatory agency could order us to reduce our rates. If our existing rates were found to be in excess of our cost of service, we could be ordered to reduce our rates prospectively and refund the excess we collected for as far back as two years prior to the date of the filing of a FERC complaint challenging the rates. Refunds could also be ordered for intrastate rates, but the refund periods vary under State laws. If any challenge to committed intrastate rates for priority service on our High Plains Pipeline tariffs were successful, Tesoro’s minimum volume commitment under our High Plains Pipeline intrastate Transportation Services Agreement could be invalidated, and the intrastate volumes shipped on our High Plains Pipeline would be at the lower uncommitted tariff rate. Any such reductions may result in lower revenues and cash flows if additional volumes and / or capacity are unavailable to offset such rate reductions, adversely affecting our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.We cannot guarantee that the jurisdictional status of transportation on our pipelines and related facilities will remain unchanged. Should circumstances change, then current non-FERC jurisdictional transportation could be found to be FERC-jurisdictional. In that case, the FERC’s ratemaking methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our actual costs, delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs, and subject us to potentially burdensome and expensive operational, reporting and other requirements. In addition, the provisions of our High Plains Pipeline Transportation Services Agreement regarding our agreement to provide, and Tesoro’s agreement to purchase, certain crude oil volume losses could be viewed as a preference to Tesoro and could result in negation of that provision and possible penalties.The majority of our natural gas gathering pipelines are not subject to regulation by the FERC; however, a change in the natural gas-gathering assets, or a change in policy, could result in increased regulation of our natural gas-gathering assets, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Natural gas gathering facilities are expressly exempted from the FERC’s jurisdiction under the NGA. Although the FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to all of our natural gas-gathering facilities we believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine if a pipeline is a gathering pipeline, and are therefore not subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation and, over time, the FERC’s policy for determining which facilities it regulates has changed. In addition, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission facilities, on the one hand, and gathering facilities, on the other, is a fact-based determination made by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and properly determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “NGPA”), then such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, a requirement to disgorge unjust profits (including charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the FERC), loss of the ability to charge market-based rates for FERC jurisdictional services and enjoinment from engaging in certain future activities, all or any of which could negatively impact our business.We own an interstate gas pipeline company, Rendezvous Pipeline, which is regulated by the FERC as a transmission pipeline under the NGA. The FERC has approved market-based rates for Rendezvous Pipeline allowing it to charge rates that customers will accept. The FERC has also established rules, policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, policies on open access transportation, construction of new facilities, market transparency, market manipulation, ratemaking, capacity release, segmentation and market center promotion, which both directly and indirectly affect our business, and could materially and adversely affect our operations and revenues.24Table of ContentsIf Tesoro or other customers satisfy only their minimum obligations under our commercial agreements, or if we are unable to renew or extend, the various commercial agreements we have, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely impacted.Our commercial agreements require Tesoro and certain third-party customers to provide us with minimum throughput volumes at our terminals and on certain pipelines, but they are not obligated to use our services with respect to volumes of crude oil, natural gas or refined products in excess of the minimum volume commitments. Nothing prohibits Tesoro or other customers from utilizing third-party terminals and pipelines to handle volumes above the minimum committed volumes. At certain of our locations, third-party terminals and pipelines may be able to offer services at more competitive rates or on a more reliable basis. In addition, the initial terms of Tesoro’s obligations under those agreements range from five to ten years. If Tesoro or other customers fail to use our facilities and services after expiration of those agreements and we are unable to generate additional revenues from third parties, our ability to make cash distributions to unitholders will be reduced.We depend on a relatively limited number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenues. If Tesoro or one of these other customers is unable to satisfy its obligations under our commercial agreements for any reason or significantly reduces the volumes we are hired to transport, process or store, our revenues would decline and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders would be adversely affected.Our two largest customers accounted for 71% of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect to derive a significant amount of our revenues from Tesoro for the foreseeable future and approximately three-quarters of anticipated 2016 revenue is expected from our top two customers (including Tesoro). This customer concentration makes us subject to the risk of nonpayment, nonperformance, re-negotiation of terms or non-renewal by these major customers under our commercial agreements. Furthermore, any event in our areas of operation or otherwise that materially and adversely affects the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of one of these major customers may adversely affect our ability to sustain or increase cash distributions to our unitholders. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the operational and business risks of these major customers (including Tesoro), some of which are related to the following:•the risk of contract cancellation, non-renewal or failure to perform by their customers;•disruptions due to equipment interruption or failure at their facilities or at third-party facilities on which their business is dependent;•the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and demand for their refined products, natural gas and NGLs, and the availability and market price of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks;•their ability to remain in compliance with the terms of their outstanding indebtedness;•changes in the cost or availability of third-party pipelines, terminals and other means of delivering and transporting crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, feedstocks and refined products;•state and federal environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations and any changes in those policies and regulations;•environmental incidents and violations and related remediation costs, fines and other liabilities; and•changes in crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined product inventory levels and carrying costs.Some of the gathering and processing agreements of the Rockies Natural Gas Business contain provisions that can reduce the cash flow stability that the agreements were designed to achieve.Several of the gathering and processing agreements of the natural gas and crude oil gathering and processing operations contain minimum volume commitments that are designed to generate stable cash flows to the Rockies Natural Gas Business, while also minimizing direct commodity price risk. Under these minimum volume commitments, the customers of the Rockies Natural Gas Business agree to ship a minimum volume of natural gas on its gathering systems or to process a minimum volume of natural gas at its processing complexes over certain periods during the term of the agreement. In addition, certain of the gathering and processing agreements of the Rockies Natural Gas Business also include an aggregate minimum volume commitment over the total life of the agreement. In these cases, once a customer achieves its aggregate minimum volume commitment, any remaining future minimum volume commitments will terminate and the customer will then simply pay the applicable gathering or processing rate multiplied by the actual throughput volumes shipped or volumes processed.25Table of ContentsIf a customer’s actual throughput volumes are less than its minimum volume commitment for the applicable period, it must make a deficiency payment at the end of the applicable period. The amount of the deficiency payment is based on the difference between the actual throughput volume shipped or processed for the applicable period and the minimum volume commitment for the applicable period, multiplied by the applicable gathering or processing fee. To the extent that a customer’s actual throughput volumes or volumes processed are above or below its minimum volume commitment for the applicable period, several of the gathering and processing agreements with minimum volume commitments contain provisions that allow the customer to use the excess volumes or the shortfall payment to credit against future excess volumes or future shortfall payments in subsequent periods. Under certain circumstances, some or all of these provisions can apply in combination with one another. It is possible that the combined effect of these mechanisms could result in reduced revenue or cash flows from one or more customers in a given period.From time to time, we may be involved in litigation, claims and other proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time, we are involved in litigation, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including but not limited to, claims related to the operation of our assets and the services we provide to our customers, as well as claims relating to environmental and regulatory matters. The uncertainties of litigation and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance and indemnification coverage make it difficult to accurately predict the ultimate financial effect of these claims. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim or elect to settle a claim, we could incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Prior to the Rockies Natural Gas Business Acquisition, QEPFS, its former affiliate Questar Gas Company (“QGC”) and QGC’s affiliate Wexpro, filed a complaint on May 1, 2012, asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and an accounting and declaratory judgment related to a 1993 gathering agreement (the “1993 Agreement”) executed when the parties were affiliates. Tesoro Logistics has agreed to indemnify QEPFSC for this claim under the acquisition agreement for QEPFS. Under the 1993 Agreement, certain of Tesoro Logistics’ systems provide gathering services to QGC charging an annual gathering rate, which is based on the cost of service calculation. QGC is disputing the annual calculation of the gathering rate, which has been calculated in the same manner since 1998, without objection by QGC. QGC continues to net disputed amounts from its monthly payments of the gathering fees, which were $20 million at December 31, 2015. In December 2014, the trial court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of QGC on the issues of the appropriate methodology for certain of the cost of service calculations. As a result of the summary judgment, the Partnership assumed a $21 million liability for estimated damages in excess of the amount QGC has netted for disputed amounts. Issues regarding other calculations, the amount of damages and certain counterclaims in the litigation remain open pending a trial on the merits. We believe the outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.XTO Energy Inc. (“XTO”) v. QEP Field Services Company. Prior to the Rockies Natural Gas Business Acquisition, XTO filed a complaint against QEPFS on January 30, 2014, asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment and an accounting related to the XTO Agreement. Tesoro Logistics processes XTO’s natural gas on a firm basis under the XTO Agreement. The XTO Agreement requires Tesoro Logistics to transport, fractionate and market XTO’s natural gas liquids derived from XTO’s processed gas. XTO is seeking monetary damages related to Tesoro Logistics allocation of charges related to XTO’s share of natural gas liquid transportation, fractionation and marketing costs associated with shortfalls in contractual firm processing volumes. We believe the outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines, processing plants and terminals are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations.We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines, terminals and natural gas gathering and processing assets are located, but we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines, processing plants and terminals on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Therefore, we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases and rights-of-way lapse or terminate or it is determined that we do not have valid leases or rights-of-way. Our loss of these rights, including loss through our inability to renew leases or right-of-way contracts on satisfactory terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.26Table of ContentsCertain of our crude oil and natural gas gathering facilities are located on Native American tribal lands and are subject to various federal and tribal approvals and regulations, which may increase our costs and delay or prevent our efforts to conduct planned operations.Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to natural gas and oil operations on Native American tribal lands. These regulations and approval requirements relate to such matters as drilling and production requirements and environmental standards. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees, requirements to employ Native American tribal members and other conditions that apply to operators and contractors conducting operations on Native American tribal lands. For example, we are currently operating under an oral arrangement with an Indian Nation in North Dakota while we renegotiate the terms of an expired pipeline easement for part of our High Plains System. Persons conducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the Native American tribal court system. In addition, if our relationships with any of the relevant Native American tribes were to deteriorate, we could face significant risks to our ability to continue operations on Native American tribal lands. One or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct our natural gas and oil gathering and transmission operations on such lands.Increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on our debt could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price will be impacted by our cash distributions and the implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may impact the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to make cash distributions at our intended levels.Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.As of December 31, 2015, we had $2.9 billion outstanding in aggregate principal amount relating to our 5.50% Senior Notes due 2019, 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020, 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021, 6.25% Senior Notes due 2022, our Unsecured Term Loan Facility due 2020 and our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. On January 29, 2016, we amended our existing secured Revolving Credit Facility that decreased the aggregate available facility limit from $900 million to $600 million and improved terms relating to pricing and financial covenants. Additionally on January 29, 2016, we syndicated a new $1.0 billion secured credit facility (“Dropdown Credit Facility”). Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including, without limitation, impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other general partnership purposes or our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. In addition, we will have to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal, premium (if any for our Senior Notes) and interest on the Senior Notes and our other indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes. Our level of indebtedness will also make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions, and may compromise our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures as compared to our competitors.Tesoro’s indebtedness and credit ratings could adversely affect our business, credit rating, ability to obtain credit in the future and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders.Tesoro must devote a portion of its cash flows from operating activities to service its indebtedness, and therefore cash flows may not be available for use in pursuing its growth strategy. Furthermore, in the event that Tesoro were to default under certain of its debt obligations, there is a risk that Tesoro’s creditors would attempt to assert claims against our assets during the litigation of their claims against Tesoro. The defense of any such claims could be costly and could materially impact our financial condition, even absent any adverse determination. In the event these claims were successful, our ability to meet our obligations to our creditors, make distributions and finance our operations could be materially adversely affected.27Table of ContentsBoth Tesoro’s long-term credit ratings and our long-term credit ratings are currently below investment grade. Credit rating agencies considered, and are likely to continue considering, Tesoro’s debt ratings when assigning ours because of Tesoro’s ownership interest in us, the significant commercial relationships between Tesoro and us, and our reliance on Tesoro for a substantial portion of our revenues. If one or more credit rating agencies were to downgrade the outstanding indebtedness of Tesoro, we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs or difficulty accessing the capital markets. Such a development could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and to make cash distributions to our unitholders.We may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.The domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions could be disrupted and are volatile from time to time due to a variety of factors, including crude oil and natural gas prices, geoeconomic and geopolitical issues, unemployment rates, weak economic conditions and uncertainty in the financial services sector. In addition, there are fewer investors and lenders willing to invest in the debt and equity capital markets in issuances by master limited partnerships than there are for more traditionally structured corporations. As a result, the cost of raising capital in the debt and equity capital markets could increase substantially or the availability of funds from these markets could diminish. The cost of obtaining funds from the credit markets may increase as many lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduce, or in some cases cease, to provide funding to borrowers.In addition, lending counterparties under existing revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, complete future acquisitions or construction projects or take advantage of other business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.Our distributions may fluctuate, and we may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner and its affiliates, to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distributions to our unitholders.The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the following:•the volume of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products that we handle;•the tariff rates with respect to volumes we transport on our pipelines (including whether such tariffs are for long-haul or short-haul segments);•the terminalling, trucking, processing and storage fees with respect to non-pipeline volumes we handle;•the mix of gathering, processing, transportation and storage services we provide; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution will also depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•the amount of our operating expenses and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to or from Tesoro with respect to those expenses and payment of an annual corporate services fee to Tesoro;•the amount of our capital expenditures;•the volatility in capital markets at the time of new debt or equity issuances;•the timing of distributions on new unit issuances relating to acquisitions;•the cost of acquisitions, if any;•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our working capital needs;•our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in our credit facilities and other debt service requirements;•an uninsured catastrophic loss;•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner; and•other business risks impacting our cash levels.28Table of ContentsThe amount of cash we have available for distribution to our unitholders depends primarily on our cash flow rather than on our profitability. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record net losses, and we may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings.Our debt obligations and restrictions in our revolving credit facility, dropdown credit facility, senior notes and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our unitholders and the value of our units.We are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow generated by our operations to meet our debt service obligations and to allow us to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Funds available for our operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our debt. Furthermore, the provisions of our revolving credit facility, dropdown credit facility and senior notes, and any other debt we incur, may restrict our ability to obtain future financing and our ability to expand business activities or pursue attractive business opportunities. They may also restrict our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. Our debt obligations contain covenants that require us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our revolving credit facility, dropdown credit facility and senior notes also contain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability (as well as the ability of our subsidiaries) to:•make certain cash distributions;•incur certain indebtedness;•incur certain liens;•make certain investments;•dispose of assets in excess of certain amounts;•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and•enter into certain transactions with affiliates.If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or issuing equity. We may not be able to complete any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the provisions of our debt obligations could result in an event of default, which could enable our lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, defaults under any other debt instruments we may have could be triggered, and our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full. As a result, the holders of our units could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.Our business may be negatively impacted by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by TLGP or Tesoro employees.Any work stoppage by Tesoro employees who provide services to us pursuant to Secondment Agreement or the Amended Omnibus Agreement may have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, Tesoro is a significant customer and any strike action or work stoppage at any of Tesoro’s facilities may result in us only receiving the minimum volume commitments under certain contracts, which could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.29Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful in integrating the operations of the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future, or in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions.From time to time, we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses. The acquisition components of our growth strategy depend on the successful integration of acquisitions. We face numerous risks and challenges to successful integration of acquired businesses, including the following:•the potential for unexpected costs, delays and challenges that may arise in integrating acquisitions into our existing business;•limitations on our ability to realize the expected cost savings and synergies from an acquisition;•challenges related to integrating acquired operations that have management teams and company cultures that differ from our own;•challenges related to the integration of businesses that operate in new geographic areas, including difficulties in identifying and gaining access to customers in new markets;•difficulties of managing operations outside of our existing core business, which may require development of additional skills and competencies; and•discovery of previously unknown liabilities following an acquisition with the acquired business or assets for which we cannot receive reimbursement under applicable indemnification provisions.Tesoro may suspend, reduce or terminate its obligations under our commercial agreements and our Secondment Agreement in some circumstances, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to unitholders.Our commercial agreements and Secondment Agreement with Tesoro include provisions that permit Tesoro to suspend, reduce or terminate its obligations under the applicable agreement if certain events occur. These events include a material breach of the agreement by us and certain force majeure events that would prevent us from performing required services under the commercial agreements. With respect to many of our facilities, these events also include the possibility that Tesoro may decide to permanently or indefinitely suspend refining operations at one or more of its refineries. Tesoro has the discretion to make such decisions notwithstanding the fact that they may significantly and adversely affect us.In the event of a force majeure event under the commercial agreements, Tesoro’s and our obligations under these agreements will be proportionately reduced or suspended to the extent that we are unable to perform. As defined in our commercial agreements and in the Secondment Agreement, force majeure events include any acts or occurrences that prevent services from being performed under the applicable agreement, such as:•acts of God, fires, floods or storms;•compliance with orders of courts or any governmental authority;•explosions, wars, terrorist acts, riots, strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances;•accidental disruption of service;•breakdown of machinery, storage tanks or pipelines and inability to obtain or unavoidable delay in obtaining material or equipment; and•similar events or circumstances, so long as such events or circumstances are beyond our reasonable control and could not have been prevented by our due diligence.Any of these events could result in our no longer being required to transport or distribute Tesoro’s minimum throughput commitments on our pipelines or terminals, respectively, and in Tesoro no longer being required to pay the full amount of fees that would have been associated with its minimum throughput commitments. These actions could result in a reduction or suspension of Tesoro’s obligations under one or more of our commercial agreements, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to unitholders.30Table of ContentsRISKS RELATING TO OUR PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURETesoro owns our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner has limited fiduciary duties, and it and its affiliates, including Tesoro, may have conflicts of interest with us and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our common unitholders.As of February 18, 2016, Tesoro and its affiliates own an approximate 36% interest in us, including a 2% general partner interest, and control our general partner. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to us and our unitholders, the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in the manner that is beneficial to its owner, Tesoro. Conflicts of interest may arise between Tesoro and its affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts, the general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates, including Tesoro, over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations:•Neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires Tesoro to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets, which could involve decisions by Tesoro to increase or decrease refinery production, connect our pipeline systems to third-party delivery points, shut down or reconfigure a refinery, or pursue and grow particular markets. Tesoro’s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the stockholders of Tesoro;•Tesoro, as our largest customer, may have an economic incentive to cause us to not seek higher tariff rates, trucking fees or terminalling fees, even if such higher rates or fees would reflect rates and fees that could be obtained in arm’s-length, third-party transactions;•Tesoro may be constrained by the terms of its debt instruments from taking actions, or refraining from taking actions, that may be in our best interests;•Our partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limiting its liability and restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;•Except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership securities and the creation, reduction or increase of cash reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of many of our cash expenditures and whether a cash expenditure is classified as an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders and to our general partner and the amount of adjusted operating surplus in any given period;•Our general partner determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us;•Our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distributions;•Our partnership agreement permits us to classify up to $30 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions to our general partner in respect of the general partner interest or the incentive distribution rights;•Our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;•Our general partner has limited and may continue to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;•Our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if it and its affiliates own more than 75% of the common units;•Our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates, including our commercial agreements with Tesoro;•Our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants, or others to perform services for us; and•Our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner’s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of our Board, which we refer to as our conflicts committee, or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.31Table of ContentsUnder the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers, directors and owners. Other than as provided in our Amended Omnibus Agreement with Tesoro, any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions. Our general partner’s discretion in establishing cash reserves may also reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders. As a result, we rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. Therefore, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.The partnership agreement also requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it determines are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures. In addition, the partnership agreement permits the general partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party, or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders.32Table of ContentsOur partnership agreement limits our general partner’s fiduciary duties to holders of our common units and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of duty.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify and reduce the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders.Additionally, our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law.For example, our partnership agreement:•provides that whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;•provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith, which requires that it believed that the decision was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of our partnership;•provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal;•provides that our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its fiduciary duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our conflicts committee or approved by a vote of a majority of outstanding common units, but is entered into in good faith by our general partner and is on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved; and•provides that in resolving conflicts of interest, it is presumed that in making its decision the general partner acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or us, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.By purchasing a common unit, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.Cost reimbursements and fees due our general partner and its affiliates for services provided are substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders.Under our partnership agreement, we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our Amended Omnibus Agreement or our Secondment Agreement, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses. Under the terms of the Amended Omnibus Agreement, we are required to pay Tesoro an annual corporate services fee, currently $9 million, for the provision of various centralized corporate services. Under the terms of our Secondment Agreement, we pay Tesoro a net annual service fee, currently $2 million, for services performed by field-level employees at the majority of the facilities included in the Acquisitions from Tesoro. We reimburse Tesoro for any direct costs actually incurred by Tesoro in providing other operational services with respect to certain of our other assets and operations. Our general partner and its affiliates may also provide us other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Payments to our general partner and its affiliates are substantial and will reduce the amount of available cash for distribution to unitholders.33Table of ContentsUnitholders have very limited voting rights and, even if they are dissatisfied, they cannot remove our general partner without its consent.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. The Board is chosen by the members of our general partner. Tesoro Corporation is currently the sole member of our general partner. Furthermore, if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding common units is required to remove our general partner. Our general partner and its affiliates currently own approximately 36% of our outstanding common units, and as a result, our public unitholders cannot remove our general partner without its consent. As a result of these limitations, the price at which our common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.Unitholders’ voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their transferees, and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of our Board, cannot vote on any matter.Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management.Our general partner interest, the control of our general partner or the incentive distribution rights of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. Furthermore, there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of Tesoro to transfer its membership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new partners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with their own choices and to control the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers.Additionally, our general partner may transfer its incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders. If our general partner transfers its incentive distribution rights to a third party but retains its general partner interest, our general partner may not have the same incentive to grow our partnership and increase quarterly distributions to unitholders over time as it would if it had retained ownership of its incentive distribution rights. Such a transfer could reduce the likelihood of Tesoro accepting offers made by us relating to assets subject to the right of first offer contained in our Amended Omnibus Agreement, as Tesoro would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our asset base.We may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute unitholder interests.At any time, we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders. Further, neither our partnership agreement nor our revolving credit facility prohibits the issuance of equity securities that may effectively rank senior to our common units. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•our unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;•the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;•the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and•the market price of our common units may decline.Tesoro may sell units in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units.As of February 18, 2016, Tesoro holds 32,445,115 common units. Additionally, we have agreed to provide Tesoro with certain registration rights. The sale of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop.34Table of ContentsAffiliates of our general partner, including Tesoro, may compete with us.While our relationship with Tesoro is a significant attribute, Tesoro and its affiliates are not restricted from competing with us, except under certain circumstances. Under our Amended Omnibus Agreement, Tesoro and its affiliates do not engage in, whether by acquisition or otherwise, the business of owning or operating crude oil or refined products pipelines, terminals or storage facilities in the U.S. that are not within, directly connected to, substantially dedicated to, or otherwise an integral part of, any refinery owned, acquired or constructed by Tesoro. This restriction, however, does not apply to:•any assets that were owned by Tesoro at the closing of our initial public offering (including replacements or expansions of those assets);•any assets acquired or constructed by Tesoro to replace one of our assets that no longer provides services to Tesoro due to the occurrence of a force majeure event under one of our commercial agreements with Tesoro that prevents us from providing services under such agreement;•any asset or business that Tesoro acquires or constructs that has a fair market value of less than $5 million; and•any asset or business that Tesoro acquires or constructs that has a fair market value of $5 million or more if we have been offered the opportunity to purchase the asset or business for fair market value not later than six months after completion of such acquisition or construction, and we decline to do so.As a result, Tesoro has the ability to construct assets, which directly compete with our assets so long as they are integral to a refinery owned by Tesoro. The limitations on the ability of Tesoro to compete with us are terminable by either party if Tesoro ceases to control our general partner.Our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions, even where the purpose or effect of the borrowing benefits the general partner or its affiliates.In some instances, our general partner may cause us to borrow funds from Tesoro or from third parties in order to permit the payment of cash distributions. These borrowings are permitted even if the purpose and effect of the borrowing is to enable us to make incentive distributions.Our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 75% of our common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. They may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units.Unitholders’ liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some jurisdictions. The unitholder could be liable for our obligations as if he were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:•we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state’s partnership statute; or•his right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business.35Table of ContentsUnitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Transferees of common units are liable for the obligations of the transferor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the transferee at the time of the transfer and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.Our general partner, or any transferee holding incentive distribution rights, may elect to cause us to issue common units and general partner units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to its incentive distribution rights, without the approval of our conflicts committee or the holders of our common units. This could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units.Our general partner, or a transferee who receives our general partner’s incentive distribution rights, has the right, at any time when it has received distributions on its incentive distribution rights at the highest level to which it is entitled (48.0%, in addition to distributions paid on its 2.0% general partner interest) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our distributions at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election, the minimum quarterly distribution will be adjusted to equal the reset minimum quarterly distribution, and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution.If our general partner elects to reset the target distribution levels, it will be entitled to receive additional common units and general partner units. We anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion. It is possible, however, that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or expects to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may, therefore, desire to be issued common units rather than retain the right to receive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. This risk could be elevated if our incentive distribution rights have been transferred to a third party. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units and general partner units in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.Our unitholders who fail to furnish certain information requested by our general partner or who our general partner, upon receipt of such information, determines are not eligible citizens may not be entitled to receive distributions in kind upon our liquidation and their common units will be subject to redemption.Our general partner may require each limited partner to furnish information about his nationality, citizenship or related status. If a limited partner fails to furnish information about his nationality, citizenship or other related status within 30 days after a request for the information or our general partner determines after receipt of the information that the limited partner is not an eligible U.S. citizen, the limited partner may be treated as a non-citizen assignee. A non-citizen assignee does not have the right to direct the voting of his units and may not receive distributions in kind upon our liquidation. Furthermore, we have the right to redeem all of the common units of any holder that is not an eligible citizen or fails to furnish the requested information. The redemption price will be paid in cash or by delivery of a promissory note, as determined by our general partner.Common units held by persons who are non-taxpaying assignees will be subject to the possibility of redemption.To avoid any adverse effect on the maximum applicable rates chargeable to customers by us under FERC regulations, or in order to reverse an adverse determination that has occurred regarding such maximum rate, our partnership agreement gives our general partner the power to amend the agreement. If our general partner determines that we are not being treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxable as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, coupled with the tax status (or lack of proof thereof) of one or more of our limited partners, has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on the maximum applicable rates chargeable to customers by us, then our general partner may adopt such amendments to our partnership agreement as it determines are necessary or advisable to obtain proof of the U.S. federal income tax status of our limited partners (and their owners, to the extent relevant) and permit us to redeem the units held by any person whose tax status has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the maximum applicable rates or who fails to comply with the procedures instituted by our general partner to obtain proof of the U.S. federal income tax status.36Table of ContentsThe New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.Because we are a publicly traded limited partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner’s board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders will not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.TAX RISKS TO COMMON UNITHOLDERSOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, or if we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation by individual states, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other tax matter affecting us.Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we are or will be so treated, a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, there would be material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.Additionally, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to unitholders.Our partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation, affect or cause us to change our business activities, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us and change the character or treatment of portions of our income. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that would adversely affect the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships, including the elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships.37Table of ContentsOn May 5, 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released proposed regulations (the “Proposed Regulations”) regarding qualifying income under Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have requested comments from industry participants regarding the rules set forth in the Proposed Regulations. The Proposed Regulations provide an exclusive list of industry-specific activities and certain limited support activities that generate qualifying income. Although the Proposed Regulations adopt a narrow interpretation of the activities that generate qualifying income, we believe the income that we treat as qualifying income satisfies the requirements for qualifying income under the Proposed Regulations. However, the Proposed Regulations could be changed before they are finalized and could take a position that is contrary to our interpretation of Section 7704 of the Code. If the regulations in their final form were to treat any material portion of our income we treat as qualifying income as non-qualifying income, we anticipate being able to treat that income as qualifying income for ten years under special transition rules provided in the Proposed Regulations.We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could cause a material reduction in our anticipated cash flows and could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes subjecting us to the entity-level tax and adversely affecting the value of our common units.Our unitholders’ share of our income will be taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.Because a unitholder will be treated as a partner to whom we will allocate taxable income, which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder’s allocable share of our taxable income will be taxable to it, which may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on its share of our taxable income even if it receives no cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take, and the IRS’s positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take and such positions may not ultimately be sustained. Any contest with the IRS, and the outcome of any IRS contest, may have a materially adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.If a unitholder sells common units, he will recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and his tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of his allocable share of our net taxable income decrease his tax basis in his common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units he sells will, in effect, become taxable income to him if he sells such common units at a price greater than his tax basis in those common units, even if the price he receives is less than his original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized on any sale of common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, if the partnership has nonrecourse liabilities, the amount realized includes a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities. In that case, if he sells his common units, he may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash he receives from the sale.Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. A tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.38Table of ContentsWe treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing U.S. Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”). A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available. It could also affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of taxable income from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. If the IRS were to challenge this method or new Treasury Regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.A unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to affect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Our unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units.We will adopt certain valuation methodologies and monthly conventions for federal income tax purposes that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between our general partner and our unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.When we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, we will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner. Our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, under our valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction between our general partner and certain of our unitholders.A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It could also affect the amount of taxable gain from our unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders’ tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.39Table of ContentsThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any 12-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.We will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns (and our unitholders could receive two Schedules K-1 if relief was not available, as described below) for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than 12 months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has recently announced a publicly traded partnership technical termination relief program whereby, if a publicly traded partnership that technically terminated requests publicly traded partnership technical termination relief and such relief is granted by the IRS, among other things, the partnership will only have to provide one Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the year notwithstanding two partnership tax years.As a result of investing in our common units, unitholders may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties.In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. Many of the states in which we operate currently impose a personal income tax on individuals. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may control assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. It is the unitholder’s responsibility to file all federal, state and local tax returns.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.
