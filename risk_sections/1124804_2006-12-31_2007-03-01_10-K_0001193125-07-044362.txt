Risk FactorsÂ” section. For instance, all other factors aside, sales of our prepackaged medications have historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters. Sales of our software products have also historically been highest in the fourth quarter. We base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue, and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term. If we have lower revenue than expected, we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response. Any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations. In addition, our product sales cycle for larger sales is lengthy and unpredictable, making it difficult to estimate our future bookings for any given period. If we do not achieve projected booking targets for a given period, securities analysts may change their recommendations on our common stock. For these and other reasons, we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors, and our stock price could suffer. Conversion of the 3.50% convertible senior debentures will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their debentures. The conversion of some or all of our 3.50% convertible senior debentures will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could depress the price of our common stock. Item 1B.
