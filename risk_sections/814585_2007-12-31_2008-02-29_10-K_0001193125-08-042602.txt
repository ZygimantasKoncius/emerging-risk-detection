Item 1A. Risk Factors (continued) amount of commercial paper outstanding, with banks rated A-1/P-1 or better by S&P and Moodys, respectively. These liquidity facilities are designed to allow Triple-A One to repay investors in the event of a market disruption in which Triple-A One is unable to issue new commercial paper to replace maturing commercial paper. Over the last eight months funding in the commercial paper market has been restricted and sometimes difficult to obtain at longer maturities. Through January 2008, no borrowings have been made under any of Triple-A Ones liquidity facilities. In February 2008, Triple-A One borrowed $15 million for one day under its liquidity facilities to repay maturing commercial paper. The borrowing under the facility was repaid by issuing new commercial paper. The financial guarantee policies issued by MBIA Corp. to insure the assets of Triple-A One cannot be accelerated to repay maturing commercial paper or borrowings under liquidity facilities and only guarantee ultimate payments over time relating to the assets. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
