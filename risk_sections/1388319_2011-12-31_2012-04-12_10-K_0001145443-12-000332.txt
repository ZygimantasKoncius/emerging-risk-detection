Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. If any events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be materially harmed. In connection with the forward looking statements that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report, you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Financing We will need to secure additional financing in 2012 in order to continue to finance our operations. If we are unable to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. As of March 26, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,700 and a working capital deficit of approximately $12.3 million. As such, our existing cash resources are insufficient to finance even our immediate operations. Accordingly, we will need to secure additional sources of capital to develop our business and product candidates as planned. We are seeking substantial additional financing through public and/or private financing, which may include equity and/or debt financings, research grants and through other arrangements, including collaborative arrangements. As part of such efforts, we may seek loans from certain of our executive officers, directors and/or current shareholders. We may also seek to satisfy some of our obligations to the guarantors of our loan with Seaside National Bank & Trust, or the Guarantors, through the issuance of various forms of securities or debt on negotiated terms. However, financing and/or alternative arrangements with the Guarantors may not be available when we need it, or may not be available on acceptable terms. If we are unable to secure additional financing in the near term, we may be forced to: · curtail or abandon our existing business plan; · reduce our headcount; · default on our debt obligations; · file for bankruptcy; · seek to sell some or all of our assets; and/or · cease our operations. If we are forced to take any of these steps, any investment in our common stock may be worthless. Our ability to obtain additional debt financing and/or alternative arrangements, with the Guarantors or otherwise, may be limited by the amount of, terms and restrictions of our then current debt. For instance, we do not anticipate repaying our Northstar loan (described below) until its scheduled maturity. Accordingly, until such time, we will generally be restricted from, among other things, incurring additional indebtedness or liens, with limited exceptions. See We have a substantial amount of debt... Additional debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that limit or further limit our operating and financial flexibility and prohibit us from making distributions to shareholders. If we raise additional capital and/or secure alternative arrangements, with the Guarantors or otherwise, by issuing equity, equity-related or convertible securities, the economic, voting and other rights of our existing shareholders may be diluted, and those newly issued securities may be issued at prices that are a significant discount to current and/or then prevailing market prices. In addition, any such newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock. If we obtain additional capital through collaborative arrangements, we may be required to relinquish greater rights to our technologies or product candidates than we might otherwise have or become subject to restrictive covenants that may affect our business. 22 Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued its report dated April 12, 2012 in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2011, which included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, it is likely that holders of our common stock will lose all of their investment. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Current Adverse Economic Conditions have had a negative impact on our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to obtain additional financing would have a significant adverse effect on our operations. In early 2008, as the United States economy began to weaken and there were increased doubts about the ability of borrowers to pay debts. Housing values began to fall and marginal loans were first to default, triggering the sub-prime lending crisis. Financial institutions responded by tightening their lending policies with respect to counterparties determined to have sub-prime mortgage risk. This tightening of institutional lending policies led to the failure of major financial institutions late in the third quarter of 2008. Continued failures, losses, and write-downs at major financial institutions through 2011 intensified concerns about credit and liquidity risks and have resulted in a sharp reduction in overall market liquidity. The global credit crisis threatens the stability of the global economy and has adversely impacted consumer confidence and spending. We believe this global credit crisis has also had a negative impact on our ability to obtain additional financing. As discussed above, our inability to obtain additional financing would have a significant adverse effect on our operations, results and financial condition. We are a development stage life sciences company with a limited operating history and a history of net losses and negative cash flows from operations. We may never be profitable, and if we incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for longer than expected, we may be unable to continue operations. We are a development stage life sciences company and have a limited operating history, limited capital, limited sources of revenue and have incurred losses since inception. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing our company, developing and engaging in clinical trials of our MyoCell product candidate, expanding our pipeline of complementary product candidates through internal development and third party licenses, expanding and strengthening our intellectual property position through internal programs and third party licenses and recruiting management, research and clinical personnel. Consequently, it may be difficult to predict our future success or viability due to our lack of operating history. As of December 31, 2011, we have accumulated a deficit during our development stage of approximately $111.0 million. Our MyoCell product candidate has not received regulatory approval or generated any material revenues and is not expected to generate any material revenues until commercialization of MyoCell, if ever. Since inception, we have generated substantial net losses, including net losses of approximately $4.7 million, $5.2 million, $4.4 million and $14.2 million in 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively and substantial negative cash flows from operations. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant and increasing net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future as we: · establish a distribution network for and commence distribution of certain products for which we have acquired distribution rights; · resume full scale enrollment of the MARVEL and REGEN Trials; · commence enrollment in our ANGEL Trial; · continue research and development and undertake new clinical trials with respect to our pipeline product candidates, including clinical trials related to MyoCell SDF-1; · seek to raise additional capital; · apply for regulatory approvals; · make capital expenditures to increase our research and development and cell culturing capabilities; 23 · add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel and develop and protect our intellectual property; · make payments pursuant to license agreements upon achievement of certain milestones; and · establish sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize products for which we obtain regulatory approval, if any. Our limited experience in conducting and managing preclinical development activities, clinical trials and the application process necessary to obtain regulatory approvals might prevent us from successfully designing or implementing a preclinical study or clinical trial. If we do not succeed in conducting and managing our preclinical development activities or clinical trials, or in obtaining regulatory approvals, we might not be able to commercialize our product candidates, or might be significantly delayed in doing so, which will materially harm our business. None of the products that we are currently developing has been approved by the FDA or any similar regulatory authority in any foreign country. Our ability to generate revenues from any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully complete clinical trials, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and implement our commercialization strategy. In addition, even if we are successful in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and bringing one or more product candidates to market, we will be subject to the risk that the marketplace will not accept those products. We may, and anticipate that we will need to, transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities and we may not succeed in such a transition. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development and commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when or if we will become profitable. Our failure to successfully commercialize our product candidates or to become and remain profitable could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings and continue our operations. We have a substantial amount of debt and may incur substantial additional debt, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue certain business objectives, obtain financing in the future and/or react to changes in our business. As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of $5.8 million in principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding accounts payable and accruals. This amount includes approximately $712,000 outstanding pursuant to a loan and security agreement formerly held by BlueCrest Venture Master Fund Limited (and now held by NorthStar Biotech Group, LLC, or Northstar, which is owned in part by certain of our existing directors and shareholders, including Dr. William P. Murphy Jr., Dr. Samuel Ahn and Charles Hart), approximately $980,000 outstanding pursuant to a Loan Agreement with Seaside National Bank, and approximately $1.5 million outstanding to the Guarantors in respect of payments made by them on our behalf in connection with our original loan with Bank of America. The Loan and Security Agreement relating to the Northstar loan contains various provisions that restrict our operating flexibility. Pursuant to the agreement, we may not, among other things: · incur additional indebtedness, except for certain permitted indebtedness (generally, accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business, leases of equipment or property incurred in the ordinary course of business not to exceed, in the aggregate, $250,000, any unsecured debt less than $20,000 or any debt not secured by the collateral pledged to Northstar that is subordinated to the rights of Northstar pursuant to a subordination agreement satisfactory to Northstar in its sole discretion); · make any principal, interest or other payments arising under or in connection with our loan from Seaside National Bank or any other debt subordinate to Northstar loan; 24 · incur additional liens on any of our assets, including any liens on our intellectual property, except for certain permitted liens including but not limited to non-exclusive licenses or sub-licenses of our intellectual property in the ordinary course of business and licenses or sub-licenses of intellectual property in connection with joint ventures and corporate collaborations (provided that any proceeds from such licenses be used to pay down the Northstar loan); · voluntarily prepay any debt prior to maturity, except for accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business, leases of equipment or property incurred in the ordinary course of business not to exceed, in the aggregate, $250,000 and any unsecured debt less than $20,000; · convey, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of property, except for sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business, sales of obsolete or unneeded equipment and transfers or our intellectual property related to product candidates other than MyoCell or MyoCell SDF-1 to a currently operating or newly formed wholly owned subsidiary; · merge with or acquire any other entity if we would not be the surviving person following such transaction; · pay dividends (other than stock dividends) to our shareholders; · redeem any outstanding shares of our common stock or any outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock except in connection with a share repurchase pursuant to which we offer to pay our then existing shareholders not more than $250,000; · enter into transactions with affiliates other than on arms-length terms; and · make any change in any of our business objectives, purposes and operations which has or could be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. These provisions could have important consequences for us, including (i) making it more difficult for us to obtain additional debt financing from another lender, or obtain new debt financing on terms favorable to us, because such new lender will have to be willing to be subordinate to Northstar, (ii) causing us to use a portion of our available cash for debt repayment and service rather than other perceived needs and/or (iii) impacting our ability to take advantage of significant, perceived business opportunities. Our failure to timely repay our obligations under the Northstar loan or meet the covenants set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement could give rise to a default under the agreement. In the event of an uncured default, the agreement provides that all amounts owed to Northstar are immediately due and payable and that Northstar has the right to enforce its security interest in the assets securing the Northstar loan. In such event, Northstar could take possession of any or all of our assets in which they hold a security interest, and dispose of those assets to the extent necessary to pay off our debts, which would materially harm our business. On March 30, 2012, we entered into an extension and waiver with Northstar pursuant to which Northstar agreed to extend until May 1, 2012 the due date for any and all principal and interest payments that were due and payable with respect to the Northstar loan on March 1, 2012 and to waive any and all defaults and/or events of default with respect to such payments. In addition to the limitations imposed on our operational flexibility by the Northstar loan as described above, the Northstar loan, the Seaside National Bank loan, our obligations to the Guarantors, and any other indebtedness incurred by us could have significant additional negative consequences, including, without limitation: · requiring the dedication of a portion of our available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash available for other purposes, including funding our research and development programs and other capital expenditures; · increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 25 · limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; · limiting our ability to react to changes in technology or our business; and · placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors. Risks Related to Product Development All of our product candidates are in an early stage of development and we may never succeed in developing and/or commercializing them. We depend heavily on the success of our MyoCell product candidate. If we are unable to commercialize MyoCell or any of our other product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may fail. · We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in our MyoCell product candidate and depend heavily on its success. MyoCell is currently in the clinical testing stage of development, although we have suspended work under our clinical trials as we seek to raise sufficient funds to complete the trials. · We need to devote significant additional research and development, financial resources and personnel to develop commercially viable products, obtain regulatory approvals and establish a sales and marketing infrastructure. · We are likely to encounter hurdles and unexpected issues as we proceed in the development of MyoCell and our other product candidates. There are many reasons that we may not succeed in our efforts to develop our product candidates, including the possibility that: · our product candidates will be deemed ineffective, unsafe or will not receive regulatory approvals; · our product candidates will be too expensive to manufacture or market or will not achieve broad market acceptance; · others will hold proprietary rights that will prevent us from marketing our product candidates; or · our competitors will market products that are perceived as equivalent or superior. Our approach of using cell-based therapy for the treatment of heart damage is risky and unproven and no products using this approach have received regulatory approval in the United States or Europe. No company has yet been successful in its efforts to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or Europe of a cell-based therapy product for the treatment of heart damage. Cell-based therapy products, in general, may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval by regulators or commercial use. Many companies in the industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, despite promising results in earlier trials. One of our competitors exploring the use of skeletal myoblasts ceased enrolling new patients in its European Phase II clinical trial based on the determination of its monitoring committee that there was a low likelihood that the trial would result in the hypothesized improvement in heart function. Although our clinical research to date suggests that MyoCell may improve the contractile function of the heart, we have not yet been able to demonstrate a mechanism of action and additional research is needed to precisely identify such mechanism. 26 If our clinical trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, we will not receive regulatory approval for or be able to commercialize our product candidates. We cannot market any product candidate until regulatory agencies grant approval or licensure. In order to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of any product candidate, we must, among other requirements, provide the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities with preclinical and clinical data that demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for each indication under the applicable standards relating to such product candidate. The preclinical studies and clinical trials of any product candidates must comply with the regulations of the FDA and other governmental authorities in the United States and similar agencies in other countries. Even if we achieve positive interim results in clinical trials, these results do not necessarily predict final results, and positive results in early trials may not be indicative of success in later trials. For example, MyoCell has been studied in a limited number of patients to date. Even though our early data has been promising, we have not yet completed any large-scale pivotal trials to establish the safety and efficacy of MyoCell. A number of participants in our clinical trials have experienced serious adverse events adjudicated or determined by trial investigators to be potentially attributable to MyoCell. See   Our product candidates may never be commercialized due to unacceptable side effects and increased mortality that may be associated with such product candidates. There is a risk that safety concerns relating to our product candidates or cell-based therapies in general will result in the suspension or termination of our clinical trials. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent regulatory approval and/or commercialization of our product candidates, including the following: · the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find that our product candidates are not sufficiently safe or effective or may find our cell culturing processes or facilities unsatisfactory; · officials at the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may interpret data from preclinical studies and clinical trials differently than we do; · our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results or may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical studies and/or clinical trials or to abandon one or more of our development programs; · the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations; · there may be delays or failure in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocols from the FDA or other regulatory authorities or obtaining institutional review board approvals or government approvals to conduct clinical trials at prospective sites; · we, or regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials because the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or undesirable side effects; · we may experience difficulties in managing multiple clinical sites; · enrollment in our clinical trials for our product candidates may occur more slowly than we anticipate, or we may experience high drop-out rates of subjects in our clinical trials, resulting in significant delays; · we may be unable to manufacture or obtain from third party manufacturers sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials; and 27 · our product candidates may be deemed unsafe or ineffective, or may be perceived as being unsafe or ineffective, by healthcare providers for a particular indication. In the SEISMIC Trial, we experienced delays attributable to slower than anticipated enrollment of patients. We may continue to experience difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, which could increase the costs or affect the timing or outcome of these trials and could prevent us from completing these trials. Failures or perceived failures in our clinical trials would delay and may prevent our product development and regulatory approval process, make it difficult for us to establish collaborations, negatively affect our reputation and competitive position and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. Our product candidates may never be commercialized due to unacceptable side effects and increased mortality that may be associated with such product candidates. Possible side effects of our product candidates may be serious and life-threatening. A number of participants in our clinical trials of MyoCell have experienced serious adverse events potentially attributable to MyoCell, including six patient deaths and 18 patients experiencing irregular heartbeats. A serious adverse event is generally an event that results in significant medical consequences, such as hospitalization, disability or death, and must be reported to the FDA. The occurrence of any unacceptable serious adverse events during or after preclinical and clinical testing of our product candidates could temporarily delay or negate the possibility of regulatory approval of our product candidates and adversely affect our business. Both our trials and independent trials have reported the occurrence of irregular heartbeats in treated patients, a significant risk to patient safety. We and our competitors have also, at times, suspended trials studying the effects of myoblasts, at least temporarily, to assess the risk of irregular heartbeats, and it has been reported that one of our competitors studying the effect of myoblast implantation prematurely discontinued a study because of the high incidence of irregular heartbeats. While we believe irregular heartbeats may be manageable with the use of certain prophylactic measures including an ICD, and antiarrhythmic drug therapy, these risk management techniques may not prove to sufficiently reduce the risk of unacceptable side effects. Although our early results suggest that patients treated with MyoCell do not face materially different health risks than heart failure patients with similar levels of damage to the heart who have not been treated with MyoCell, we are still in the process of seeking to demonstrate that our product candidates do not pose unacceptable health risks. We have not yet treated a sufficient number of patients to allow us to make a determination that serious unintended consequences will not occur. We depend on third parties to assist us in the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could result in costs and delays and prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or successfully commercializing our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. We engage consultants and CROs to help design, and to assist us in conducting, our preclinical studies and clinical trials and to collect and analyze data from those studies and trials. The consultants and contract research organizations we engage interact with clinical investigators to enroll patients in our clinical trials. As a result, we depend on these consultants and CROs to perform the studies and trials in accordance with the investigational plan and protocol for each product candidate and in compliance with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, for conducting, recording and reporting results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and the trial participants are adequately protected, as required by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. We may face delays in our regulatory approval process if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or competent fashion or if we are forced to change service providers. The risk of delays is heightened for our clinical trials conducted outside of the United States, where it may be more difficult for us to ensure that studies are conducted in compliance with foreign regulatory requirements. Any third parties that we hire to conduct clinical trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may otherwise prove to be unsuccessful. If there are delays or failures in clinical trials or regulatory approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our development costs will increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If we need to enter into replacement arrangements 28 because a third party is not performing in accordance with our expectations, we may not be able to do so without undue delays or considerable expenditures or at all. Risks Related to Government Regulation and Regulatory Approvals Our cell-based product candidates are based on novel technologies and the FDA and regulatory agencies in other countries have limited experience reviewing product candidates using these technologies. We are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on new technologies. The novel nature of our product candidates creates significant challenges in regards to product development and optimization, government regulation, third party reimbursement and market acceptance. These include: · the scientific basis of our technology could be determined to be less sound than we believe; · the time and effort required to solve novel technical problems could delay the development of our product candidates; · the FDA and regulatory agencies in other countries have relatively limited experience with therapies based upon cellular medicine generally and, as a result, the pathway to regulatory approval for our cell-based product candidates may be more complex and lengthy; and · the healthcare community has relatively little experience with therapies based upon cellular medicine and, accordingly, following regulatory approval, if any, our product candidates may not become widely accepted by physicians, patients, third party payors or the healthcare community. As a result, the development and commercialization pathway for our cell-based therapies may be subject to increased uncertainty, as compared to the pathway for new conventional drugs. We are subject to numerous risks associated with seeking regulatory approval of MyoCell pursuant to a protocol that permits the use of a catheter system which is still subject to FDA approval. The catheter system we intend to use in connection with our MARVEL Trial is owned by an unaffiliated third party. Although we have entered into a two-year supply agreement for delivery of the catheter system for use in the MARVEL Trial, we are subject to a number of risks not addressed by the parties in the supply agreement. We have been cleared by the FDA to proceed under the protocol for our MARVEL Trial, which protocol permits participating trial investigators to use either our MyoCath catheters Biosense Websters (a Johnson & Johnson company) NOGA® Cardiac Navigation System along with the MyoStar™ injection catheter for the delivery of MyoCell to patients enrolled in the trial. We do not currently have any inventory of MyoCath catheters available for use in pre-clinical and clinical trials and none are currently in production. Although we are considering several contract manufacturers to produce additional inventory, we do not currently have any MyoCath catheters available for use by investigators in the MARVEL Trial or for sale for other pre-clinical and clinical uses. As a result, if we were to reinitiate the MARVEL Trial in the immediate future, investigators in the trial would practically be limited to using the NOGA Cardiac Navigation System along with the MyoStar™ injection catheter for the delivery of MyoCell to patients enrolled in the trial. We further anticipate that if MyoCell receives regulatory approval, such approval will require MyoCell to be injected with a catheter system that has also secured regulatory approval. Accordingly, the commercial deployment of MyoCell is dependent upon MyoStar, MyoCath or some other catheter system securing regulatory approval for use with MyoCell. Although MyoStar has received CE mark approval in Europe, neither MyoStar, MyoCath nor any other catheter system is commercially available in the United States and they may only be used pursuant to FDA approved investigational protocols. Notwithstanding the devotion of considerable resources to the development and testing of MyoStar and MyoCath, they may never receive additional or any, respectively, regulatory approval that will allow for their commercial use with MyoCell. We are not affiliated with Biosense Webster, the Cordis Corporation or any other Johnson & Johnson company. Although we entered into a supply agreement with Biosense Webster on May 10, 2007 pursuant to which 29 it has agreed to deliver MyoStar to us for a two year period at an agreed upon price as and when required by the MARVEL Trial, we currently have no right to control the further development, clinical testing and/or refinement of MyoStar. Biosense Webster currently has the right to make the following types of decisions without consulting with or even considering our views, which decisions could directly or indirectly negatively impact our efforts and/or ability to secure regulatory approval of MyoCell: · the terms and conditions under which MyoStar will be made available for use to trial investigators, if at all, after the term of the supply agreement; · the terms and conditions under which the diagnostic consoles that are part of the NOGA® Cardiac Navigation System will be made available for use to trial investigators, if at all; · the modification or not of the MyoStar System or any of its components and its protocol for use as a result of information obtained during trials; · the license or sale of the MyoStar System related intellectual property to a third party, potentially including our competitors; · the use of the MyoStar System or any of its components in myoblast-based clinical therapies other than ours; and the suspension or abandonment of other clinical trials involving MyoStar. The unavailability of the MyoStar System, for any reason, would have a material adverse effect on our product development and commercialization efforts as we will be unable to recover the time and money expended on the MARVEL Trial prior to such determination of unavailability. We must comply with extensive government regulations in order to obtain and maintain marketing approval for our products in the United States and abroad. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may be forced to cease our operations. Our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and in every other country where they will be tested or used. These regulations are wide-ranging and govern, among other things: · product design, development, manufacture and testing; · product safety and efficacy; · product labeling; · product storage and shipping; · record keeping; · pre-market clearance or approval; · advertising and promotion; and · product sales and distribution. We cannot market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Any difficulties that we encounter in obtaining regulatory approval may have a substantial adverse impact on our business and cause our stock price to decline significantly. In the United States, the FDA imposes substantial requirements on the introduction of biological products and many medical devices through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years and the time required to do so may vary substantially based upon the type and complexity of the biological product or medical device. 30 In addition, product candidates that we believe should be classified as medical devices for purposes of the FDA regulatory pathway may be determined by the FDA to be biologic products subject to the satisfaction of significantly more stringent requirements for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and cell culturing and marketing of our product candidates outside the United States vary widely from country to country. Foreign approvals may take longer to obtain than FDA approvals and can require, among other things, additional testing and different clinical trial designs. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval processes. Some foreign regulatory agencies also must approve prices of the products. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to market our product candidates in any foreign country. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain required approvals in any foreign country, we will not be able to sell our product candidates in that country and our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates for any indication in a timely manner or at all. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates for at least one indication, we will not be permitted to market our product candidates and may be forced to cease our operations. Even if some of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, these approvals may be subject to conditions, and we and our third party manufacturers will in any event be subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight. Even if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, the manufacturing, marketing and sale of our product candidates will be subject to stringent and ongoing government regulation. Conditions of approval, such as limiting the category of patients who can use the product, may significantly impact our ability to commercialize the product and may make it difficult or impossible for us to market a product profitably. Changes we may desire to make to an approved product, such as cell culturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval, which could prevent us from updating or otherwise changing an approved product. If our product candidates are approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for the treatment of any indications, regulatory labeling may specify that our product candidates be used in conjunction with other therapies. For instance, we currently anticipate that prior implantation of an ICD and treatment with optimal drug therapy will be required at least initially as a condition to treatment with MyoCell. Once obtained, regulatory approvals may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product. Regulatory approval may also require costly post-marketing follow-up studies, and failure of our product candidates to demonstrate sufficient efficacy and safety in these studies may result in either withdrawal of marketing approval or severe limitations on permitted product usage. In addition, numerous additional regulatory requirements relating to, among other processes, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping will also apply. Furthermore, regulatory agencies subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturers facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is time consuming and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If any of our product candidates is approved, we will be required to report certain adverse events involving our products to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning the advertisement and promotional labeling of our products. As a result, even if we obtain necessary regulatory approvals to market our product candidates for any indication, any adverse results, circumstances or events that are subsequently discovered could require that we cease marketing the product for that indication or expend money, time and effort to ensure full compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 31 In response to recent events regarding questions about the safety of certain approved prescription products, including the lack of adequate warnings, the FDA and the U.S. Congress are currently considering new regulatory and legislative approaches to advertising, monitoring and assessing the safety of marketed drugs, including legislation authorizing the FDA to mandate labeling changes for approved products, particularly those related to safety. It is possible that congressional and FDA initiatives pertaining to ensuring the safety of marketed biologics and similar initiatives in other countries, or other developments pertaining to the pharmaceutical industry, could require us to expend additional resources to comply with such initiatives and could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or defects in design or manufacture. In the event any of our product candidates receives approval and is commercialized, a government-mandated or voluntary product recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, device malfunctions, or other negative events such as serious injuries or deaths, or quality-related issues such as cell culturing errors or design or labeling defects. Recalls of any of our potential products could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Any failure by us, or by any third parties that may manufacture or market our products, to comply with the law, including statutes and regulations administered by the FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities, could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines and other civil penalties, suspension of regulatory approvals and the resulting requirement that we suspend sales of our products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, export or import restrictions, interruption of production, operating restrictions, closure of the facilities used by us or third parties to manufacture our product candidates, injunctions or criminal prosecution. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We must comply with federal, state and foreign laws, regulations and other rules relating to the healthcare business, and, if we do not fully comply with such laws, regulations and other rules, we could face substantial penalties. We are, or will be directly or indirectly through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, the states and foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include the following: · the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback law, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; · other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment; · the Federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government; · the Federal False Statements Act, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and · state and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing. 32 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws, regulations, rules or policies described above or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our customers are or will be subject, or if the interpretation of the foregoing changes, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our customers are found non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations, and additional legal or regulatory change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation. Our business involves the use of hazardous materials that could expose us to environmental and other liability. Our facility in Sunrise, Florida is subject to various local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including chemicals and microorganisms used in connection with our research and development activities. In the United States, these laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Test Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these regulations, we cannot assure you that accidental contamination or injury to employees and third parties from these materials will not occur. Risks Related to Commercialization of our Product Candidates The healthcare community has relatively little experience with therapies based on cellular medicine and, accordingly, if our product candidates do not become widely accepted by physicians, patients, third party payors or the healthcare community, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any. We are developing cell-based therapy product candidates for the treatment of heart damage that represent novel and unproven treatments and, if approved, will compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others, including major pharmaceutical companies. We cannot predict or guarantee that physicians, patients, healthcare insurers, third party payors or health maintenance organizations, or the healthcare community in general, will accept or utilize any of our product candidates. We anticipate that, if approved, we will market MyoCell primarily to interventional cardiologists, who are generally not the primary care physicians for patients who may be eligible for treatment with MyoCell. Accordingly, our commercial success may be dependent on third party physicians referring their patients to interventional cardiologists for MyoCell treatment. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, the degree of market acceptance of those products will depend on many factors, including: · our ability to provide acceptable evidence and the perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third party payors, of the positive characteristics of our product candidates relative to existing treatment methods, including their safety, efficacy, cost effectiveness and/or other potential advantages; · the incidence and severity of any adverse side effects of our product candidates; · the availability of alternative treatments; · the labeling requirements imposed by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, including the scope of approved indications and any safety warnings; · our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement for our products candidates; 33 · the inclusion of our products on insurance company coverage policies; · the willingness and ability of patients and the healthcare community to adopt new technologies; · the procedure time associated with the use of our product candidates; · our ability to manufacture or obtain from third party manufacturers sufficient quantities of our product candidates with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost to meet demand; and · marketing and distribution support for our products. Failure to achieve market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any of our product candidates achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if competing products or technologies are introduced that are received more favorably or are more cost-effective. There is substantial uncertainty as to the coverage that may be available and the reimbursement rates that may be established for our product candidates. Any failure to obtain third party coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement for our product candidates will likely have a material adverse effect on our business. If we successfully develop, and obtain necessary regulatory approvals for, our product candidates we intend to sell them initially in Europe and the United States. We have not yet submitted any of our product candidates to CMS or any private or governmental third party payor in the United States to determine whether or not our product candidates will be covered under private or public health insurance plans or, if they are covered, what coverage or reimbursement rates may be available. Although we believe hospitals may be entitled to some procedure reimbursement for MyoCell, we cannot assure you that such reimbursement will be adequate or available at all. In Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceutical products and services and the level of government reimbursement generally are subject to governmental control. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in European markets vary significantly by country, and may include both government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct one or more clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. Conducting one or more clinical trials for this purpose would be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our product candidates. We may not obtain coverage or reimbursement or pricing approvals from countries in Europe in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure to receive coverage or reimbursement or pricing approvals from one or more European countries could effectively prevent us from selling our product candidates in those countries, which could materially adversely affect our business. In the United States, our revenues will depend upon the coverage and reimbursement rates and policies established for our product candidates by third party payors, including governmental authorities, managed-care providers, public health insurers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new healthcare products approved for marketing by the FDA or regulatory agencies in other countries. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether newly approved medical products will be eligible for coverage by third party payors or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be for those products. Furthermore, cell-based therapies like MyoCell may be more expensive than pharmaceuticals due to, among other things, the higher cost and complexity associated with the research, development and production of these therapies. This, in turn, may make it more difficult for us to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors, particularly if we cannot demonstrate a favorable cost-benefit relationship. Third party payors may also deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement for our potential products if they determine that the product has not received appropriate clearances from the FDA or other government regulators or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that adequate third party coverage or reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates to allow us to successfully commercialize these product candidates. 34 Coverage and reimbursement rates for our product candidates may be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in other countries in the future. Coverage policies and reimbursement rates are subject to change and we cannot guarantee that current coverage policies and reimbursement rates will be applicable to our product candidates in the future. U.S. federal, state and foreign agencies and legislatures from time to time may seek to impose restrictions on coverage, pricing, and reimbursement level of drugs, devices and healthcare services in order to contain healthcare costs. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenues. We do not have a sales and marketing force and related infrastructure and have limited experience in the sales, marketing and distribution of our product candidates. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing force or outsource these functions to third parties. Currently, we intend to internally develop a direct sales and marketing force in both Europe and the United States as we approach commercial approval of our product candidates. In other regions, we intend to seek to enter into exclusive or non-exclusive distribution arrangements. The development of our own sales and marketing force will result in us incurring significant costs before the time that we may generate revenues. We may not be able to attract, hire, train and retain qualified sales and marketing personnel to build a significant or effective marketing and sales force for sales of our product candidates. Product liability and other claims against us may reduce demand for our products or result in substantial damages. We anticipate that we will need to obtain and maintain additional or increased insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain or maintain such coverage on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. A product liability claim, a clinical trial liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business exposes us to potential liability risks that may arise from the clinical testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and the manufacture and sale of any approved products. Any clinical trial liability or product liability claim or series of claims or class actions brought against us, with or without merit, could result in: · liabilities that substantially exceed our existing clinical trial liability insurance, or any clinical trial liability or product liability insurance that we may obtain in the future, which we would then be required to pay from other sources, if available; · an increase in the premiums we pay for our clinical trial liability insurance and any clinical trial liability or product liability insurance we may obtain in the future or the inability to renew or obtain clinical trial liability or product liability insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, or at all; · withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers or patients; · damage to our reputation and the reputation of our products, including loss of market share; · regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications; · litigation costs; and · diversion of management’s attention from managing our business. We do not currently have product liability insurance because none of our product candidates has yet been approved for commercialization. While we plan to seek product liability insurance coverage if any of our product candidates are sold commercially, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain product liability insurance on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect against potential losses. 35 Claims may be made by consumers, healthcare providers, third party strategic collaborators or others selling our products if one of our products or product candidates causes, or appears to have caused, an injury. We may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. For example, we rely on the expertise of physicians, nurses and other associated medical personnel to perform the medical procedures and processes related to our product candidates. If these medical personnel are not properly trained or are negligent in using our product candidates, the therapeutic effect of our product candidates may be diminished or the patient may suffer injury, which may subject us to liability. In addition, an injury resulting from the activities of our suppliers may serve as a basis for a claim against us. We do not intend to promote, or to in any way support or encourage the promotion of, our product candidates for off-label or otherwise unapproved uses. However, if our product candidates are approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities, we cannot prevent a physician from using them for any off-label applications. If injury to a patient results from such an inappropriate use, we may become involved in a product liability suit, which will likely be expensive to defend. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our clinical efforts, product development efforts and any subsequent product commercialization efforts, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success will depend in part on establishing and maintaining effective strategic partnerships, collaborations and licensing agreements. Our strategy for the development, testing, culturing and commercialization of our product candidates relies on establishing and maintaining numerous collaborations with various corporate partners, consultants, scientists, researchers, licensors, licensees and others. While we are continually in discussions with a number of companies, universities, research institutions, consultants, scientists, researchers, licensors, licensees and others to establish additional relationships and collaborations, which are typically complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement, we may not reach definitive agreements with any of them. Even if we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms. Furthermore, any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements, if any, will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Possible future collaborations have risks, including the following: · our collaboration agreements are likely to be for fixed terms and subject to termination by our collaborators in the event of a material breach or lack of scientific progress by us; · our collaborators are likely to have the first right to maintain or defend our intellectual property rights and, although we would likely seek to secure the right to assume the maintenance and defense of our intellectual property rights if our collaborators do not, our ability to do so may be compromised by our collaborators' acts or omissions; · our collaborators may utilize our intellectual property rights in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential liability; · our collaborators may underfund or not commit sufficient resources to the testing, marketing, distribution or development of our product candidates; and · our collaborators may develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, or encounter conflicts of interest or changes in business strategy or other business issues, which could adversely affect their willingness or ability to fulfill their obligations to us. These arrangements also may require us to grant certain rights to third parties, including exclusive marketing rights to one or more products, or may have other terms that are burdensome to us, and may involve the issuance of our securities. If any of our partners terminates its relationship with us or fails to perform its obligations 36 in a timely manner, the development or commercialization of our technology and product candidates may be substantially delayed. Further, disputes may arise with our collaborators about inventorship and corresponding rights in know-how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our collaborators. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We hold limited patent and other intellectual property rights, and our success will be dependent in large part on safeguarding our existing intellectual property rights and obtaining patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates. We hold limited patent rights in our product candidates. Our MyoCath product candidate is protected by a patent, expiring in September 2017, in which we have an irrevocable co-exclusive license. Our MyoCell product candidate is no longer protected by patents, which means that competitors will be free to sell products that incorporate the same or similar technologies that are used in MyoCell without infringing our patent rights. As a result, MyoCell, if approved for use, may be vulnerable to competition in the form of products that use the same or similar technologies. We have previously licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to our MyoCell product candidate. These licenses have all lapsed as of the date of this report, although we have had discussions with the relevant licensor regarding a potential reinstatement of our rights in such licenses. Our commercial success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to: · compel the owners of the patents licensed to us to defend and enforce such patents, to the extent such patents may be applicable to our products and material to their commercialization; · obtain new patent and other proprietary protection for MyoCell and our other product candidates; · obtain and/or maintain appropriate licenses to patents, patent applications or other proprietary rights held by others with respect to our technology, both in the United States and other countries; · preserve intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates; and · operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our product candidates, or the failure to protect our existing patent rights, may impair our ability to be competitive. The availability of infringing products in markets where we have patent protection, or the availability of competing products in markets where we do not have adequate patent protection, could erode the market for our product candidates, negatively impact the prices we can charge for our product candidates, and harm our reputation if infringing or competing products are manufactured to inferior standards. Our most important license agreement with respect to MyoCath is co-exclusive and the co-licensor of the intellectual property, a division of Abbott Laboratories, may also seek to commercialize MyoCath. In June 2003, we assigned our exclusive license to the primary patent protecting MyoCath to ACS, originally a subsidiary of Guidant Corporation and now d/b/a Abbott Vascular, a division of Abbott Laboratories. In connection with this agreement, ACS granted to us a co-exclusive, irrevocable, fully paid-up license to this patent for the life of the patent. Because our license is co-exclusive with ACS, ACS may, parallel to our efforts, seek to commercialize MyoCath if MyoCath secures regulatory approval. Accordingly, even if ACS does nothing to assist us to secure regulatory approval of MyoCath, ACS may become a direct competitor in the MyoCath manufacturing and supply business. In addition, pursuant to our agreement with ACS, we are prohibited from contracting with third parties for the distribution of MyoCath. Our patents may not be valid or enforceable, and may be challenged by third parties. We cannot assure you that any patents issued or licensed to us would be held valid by a court or administrative body or that we would be able to successfully enforce our patents against infringers, including our 37 competitors. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, and the validity and enforceability of a patent is susceptible to challenge on numerous legal grounds. Challenges raised in patent infringement litigation brought by or against us may result in determinations that patents that have been issued or licensed to us or any patents that may be issued to us or our licensors in the future are invalid, unenforceable or otherwise subject to limitations. In the event of any such determinations, third parties may be able to use the discoveries or technologies claimed in these patents without paying licensing fees or royalties to us, which could significantly diminish the value of our intellectual property and our competitive advantage. Even if our patents are held to be enforceable, others may be able to design around our patents or develop products similar to our products that are not within the scope of any of our patents. In addition, enforcing the patents that have been licensed to us and any patents that may be issued to us in the future against third parties may require significant expenditures regardless of the outcome of such efforts. Our inability to enforce our patents against infringers and competitors may impair our ability to be competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are not able to protect and control unpatented trade secrets, know-how and other technological innovation, we may suffer competitive harm. We rely to a large extent on unpatented technology, trade secrets, confidential information and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Trade secrets are difficult to protect. In order to protect proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and others. These agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individuals relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information or result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information that have been licensed to us or that we own, and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using trade secrets that have been licensed to us or that we own is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, some of our academic institution licensors, collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations, our ability to protect our proprietary information or obtain patent protection in the future may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other Risks Related to Our Business We depend on attracting and retaining key management and scientific personnel and the loss of these personnel could impair the development of our products candidates. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with academic institutions, clinicians and scientists. We are highly dependent upon our senior scientific staff, many of whom have developed very specialized expertise in their position. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior scientific staff could significantly delay or prevent the successful completion of our clinical trials or commercialization of our product candidates. The employment of each of our employees with us is at will, and each employee can terminate his or her employment with us at any time. We do not have a succession plan in place for any of our officers and key employees. We do not carry insurance on any of our other key employees and, accordingly, their death or disability may have a material adverse effect on our business. 38 The competition for qualified personnel in the life sciences field is intense. We will need to hire additional personnel, including regulatory and sales personnel, as we continue to expand our development activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms given our geographic location and the competition for such personnel among life sciences, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other companies. If we are unable to attract new employees and retain existing employees, we may be unable to continue our development and commercialization activities and our business may be harmed. We face intense competition in the biotechnology and healthcare industries. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies developing heart failure treatments both in the United States and abroad, as well as numerous academic and research institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations engaged in drug discovery activities or funding both in the United States and abroad. We also face competition from entities and healthcare providers using more traditional methods, such as surgery and pharmaceutical regimens, to treat heart failure. We believe there are a substantial number of heart failure products under development by numerous pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies, and it is likely that other competitors will emerge. We are also aware of several competitors developing cell-based therapies for the treatment of heart damage, including Aastrom Bioscience, Inc., Aldagen, Inc., Angioblast Systems, Inc., Athersys, Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Cytori Therapeutics, Inc., MG Biotherapeutics, LLC (a joint venture between Genzyme Corporation and Medtronic, Inc.), Mytogen, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Advanced Cell Technology, Inc.), Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., ViaCell, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of PerkinElmer, Inc.) and potentially others. We also recognize that there may be competitors and competing technologies, therapies and/or products that we are not aware of. These third parties also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and registering patients for clinical trials, as well as acquiring or licensing intellectual property and technology. Many competitors have more experience than we do in research and development, marketing, cell culturing, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. The competitors, some of which have their own sales and marketing organizations, have greater financial and technical resources than we do and may be better equipped than we are to sell competing products, obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, obtain approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for products more rapidly than we do, or develop treatments or cures that are safer or more effective than those we propose to develop. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research in the field of heart damage may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies and may establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. MyoCell is a clinical therapy designed to be utilized at least a few months after a patient has suffered heart damage. Our competitors may discover technologies and techniques for the acute treatment of heart failure, which, if successful in treating heart failure shortly after its occurrence, may reduce the market size for treatments for chronic heart damage, including MyoCell. Our industry is subject to rapid technological change. Our industry is subject to rapid technological change and our cellular-based therapies involve new and rapidly developing technology. Our competitors may discover and develop new technologies and techniques, or enter into partnerships with collaborators in order to develop, competing products that are more effective or less costly than the product candidates we hope to secure regulatory approval for. In light of the industrys limited experience with cell-based therapies and the dedication of significant resources to a better understanding of this field, we expect these cell-based technologies to undergo significant change in the future. For example, some of our competitors are exploring whether the use of cells, other than myoblasts, is safer or more effective than MyoCell. If 39 there is rapid technological development or new product introductions, our current and future product candidates or methods may become obsolete or noncompetitive before or after we commercialize them. Risks Related to Our Common Stock An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not develop or continue. Prior to our initial public offering, there was no public market for our common stock. Following our initial public offering, our common stock was traded on the NASDAQ Global Market and, subsequently, the NASDAQ Capital Market. On February 25, 2009, we received notification from The NASDAQ Stock Market of its determination to discontinue our NASDAQ listing effective February 27, 2009. We filed for quotation of our common stock on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board and that application was approved by FINRA on May 13, 2009. On February 23, 2011 we received notice of FINRAs determination of our ineligibility for continued quotation of our shares on the OTCBB due to quoting inactivity under SEC Rule 15c2-11. On March 9, 2011 we again filed for quotation of our common stock on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board and that application was approved by FINRA on March 29, 2011. We cannot offer any assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will continue or how liquid that market may be. As a result, relatively small trades may have a disproportionate impact on the price of our common stock, which may contribute to the price volatility of our common stock and could limit your ability to sell your shares. The market price of our common stock could also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors described in this section and other matters, including: · publications of clinical trial results by clinical investigators or others about our products and competitors' products and/or our industry; · changes by securities analysts in financial estimates of our operating results and the operating results of our competitors; · publications of research reports by securities analysts about us, our competitors or our industry; · fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results; · retention and departures of key personnel; · our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts' projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market; · strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; · the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry; · speculation in the press or investment community; and · natural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, especially life sciences and pharmaceutical companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock. In the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert 40 our management's attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of us that shareholders may consider favorable or attempts to replace or remove our management that could be beneficial to our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions, such as the right of our directors to issue preferred stock from time to time with voting, economic and other rights superior to those of our common stock without the consent of our shareholders, all of which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. In addition, our bylaws impose restrictions on the persons who may call special shareholder meetings. Furthermore, the Florida Business Corporation Act contains an affiliated transaction provision that prohibits a publicly-held Florida corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations or other extraordinary corporate transactions with an interested shareholder unless, among others, (i) the transaction is approved by a majority of disinterested directors before the person becomes an interested shareholder; (ii) the interested shareholder has owned at least 80% of the corporation's outstanding voting shares for at least five years; or (iii) the transaction is approved by the holders of two-thirds of the corporation's voting shares other than those owned by the interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is defined as a person who together with affiliates and associates beneficially owns more than 10% of the corporation's outstanding voting shares. The Florida Business Corporation Act also prohibits the voting of shares in a publicly-held Florida corporation that are acquired in a control share acquisition unless the holders of a majority of the corporation's voting shares (exclusive of shares held by officers of the corporation, inside directors or the acquiring party) approve the granting of voting rights as to the shares acquired in the control share acquisition or unless the acquisition is approved by the corporation's Board of Directors. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company even if this change of control would benefit our shareholders. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, accordingly, capital appreciation of our common stock, if any, will be a shareholder's sole source of gain from an investment in our common stock. Our policy is to retain earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of our business and, accordingly, we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock or other securities and do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, shareholders will need to sell shares of our common stock to realize a return on their investments, if any, and this capital appreciation, if any, will be a shareholder's sole source of gain from an investment in the common stock. The declaration and payment of dividends by us are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and the restrictions specified in our articles of incorporation and by applicable law. In addition, under the terms of the Northstar Loan, we are restricted from paying cash dividends to our shareholders while this loan is outstanding. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Our common stock may be considered a penny stock, and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell. Our common stock is considered to be a penny stock. It does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of penny stock under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. Our common stock is a penny stock because it meets one or more of the following conditions (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a recognized national exchange or (iii) it is not quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market, or has a price less than $5.00 per share. The principal result or effect of being designated a penny stock is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock are subject to the penny stock regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor's account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer 41 to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor's financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
