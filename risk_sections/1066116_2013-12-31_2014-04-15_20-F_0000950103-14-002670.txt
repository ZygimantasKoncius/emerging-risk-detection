D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business” and “Item 8. Financial Information—A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—Legal Proceedings.” According to the new PCS regulations, we are required to adjust our operating processes and agreements to such new rules, including our interconnection agreements, as well as agreements with our customers. By April 2005, substantially all of our interconnection arrangements were covered by agreements that had been amended to reflect the PCS regulations. In August 2007, Anatel issued Resolution No. 477 establishing new obligations regarding PCS, in particular in connection with users’ rights towards their mobile services providers. The new resolution came into effect in February 2008. The main PCS new regulatory obligations include the following: · Creating at least one customer service department for each municipality division; · Increasing prepaid card terms (from 90 days to at least 180 days); · Reimbursing prepaid credits; · Supplying a protocol number for each communication with a customer; · Sending such protocol number by SMS; · Cancelling service in every customer’s service channel of the Company; · Cancelling service in 24 hours; 61 Table of Contents · Sending free prepaid card detailed report of service use; · Changing rules for scheduled billing of postpaid customers; · Ceasing to impose fines on customers based on breach of loyalty plans; and · Taking measures to prevent SMS spamming. In October 2012, Anatel enacted the Regulation on Universal Obligations related to the fixed line universal service obligations (Plano Geral de Metas de Universalização), or PGMU, regulating backhauling, public pay phones and telephone services for families with low incomes, among others. In November 2012, Anatel enacted the General Plan for Competition Goals (Plano Geral de Metas de Competição), whose goal is to encourage competition by creating interconnection obligations and the sharing of infrastructure already installed by other operators. In March 2013, Anatel proposed the adoption of a single regulation for the telecommunications sector, with general rules for customer service, billing, and service offers, which would be applicable to fixed, mobile, broadband and cable TV customers. The initiative, still under development by Anatel, aims to bring all telecommunications services in line with the Customer Service Law (Lei do SAC), particularly with respect to deadlines and data protection rules. Significant Market Power In November 2012, Anatel published a new competition framework known as the PGMC. Also in November 2012, Anatel published a series of regulations identifying groups with significant market power in the following relevant markets as defined by the PGMC: (i) copper pair or coaxial cable data transmission access landline network infrastructure offer at transmission rates up to 10 Mbps (Act No. 6.617, of November 8, 2012); (ii) wholesale local transport and long distance inland network infrastructure offer for data transmission rates of 34 Mbps or less (Act No. 6.619, of November 8, 2012); (iii) passive infrastructure for transport and access networks (Act No. 6.620, of November 8, 2012); (iv) mobile network inbound calls (Act No. 6.621, of November 8, 2012); and (v) national roaming (Act No. 6.622, of November 8, 2012). The TIM Group, comprised of TIM Celular and Intelig, is currently classified as a significant market power in the following markets: (i) passive infrastructure in transport and access networks (provision of towers); (ii) mobile network inbound calls (otherwise referred to as the mobile network termination market); and (iii) national roaming. Due to such classification we are now subject to increased regulation under the PGMC, which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, because we have been classified as having significant market power in the mobile network termination market, the rates charged by mobile service providers to other mobile service providers to terminate calls on their mobile networks, or VU-M, are regulated. VU-M mobile termination rates may currently be negotiated among operators with reference rates only applied by Anatel in case of dispute, and, beginning in 2016, VU-M reference rates are expected to be determined on the basis of costs. Moreover, because of our classification as having significant market power in the national roaming market, we must offer roaming services to other mobile providers without significant market power at the lowest tariff rate in the market. We are also required to provide other providers without significant market power access to our towers and masts due to our classification as having significant market power in that portion of the passive infrastructure market. For additional detail, see – “Network Usage Charges”, “Roaming Fees”, “Interconnection Charges” and “Long Distance”. Interconnection Regulation Telecommunication operators must publish a public interconnection offer on both economic and technical conditions and are subject to the “General Interconnection Regulatory Framework” promulgated by Anatel in 2005. 62 Table of Contents The free negotiation process for interconnection charges has been extended and will proceed until a “cost based” reference interconnection value is set by Anatel. Under a specific Resolution, Anatel developed a new model to determine reference costs for the use of mobile networks by providers who have significant market power. These values will be used in arbitration cases involving termination rates by Anatel. In 2005, Anatel issued a ruling for “Accounting Separation and Cost Accounting,” introducing the obligation of presenting the Accounting Separation and Allocation Document (Documento de Separação e Alocação de Contas), or DSAC, by the license holders and groups holding Significant Market Power in the offering of fixed and/or mobile network interconnection and wholesale leased lines (Exploração Industrial De Linha Dedicada), or EILD. Starting from 2006 (for fixed operators) and 2008 (for mobile operators related to the results of 2006 and 2007), operators (TIM included) are delivering the requested information to Anatel. In 2013, Anatel reviewed almost the entirety of DSAC. Pursuant to Resolutions No. 608 and 619, the level of information to be delivered to Anatel and the number of products analyzed were extended. Rules on costs allocation were also standardized in order to allow comparison of the results among operators. In September 2013, Anatel submitted to for public comment a draft of its rule on pricing of STFC and PCS interconnection, as well as EILD, based on a cost model. Such rule and the corresponding reference amounts are still under development by Anatel. With respect to mobile interconnection, in October 2011, Anatel established a mechanism for reducing fixed-to-mobile call rates, applying a reduction of 18% in 2012 and 12% in 2013. In November 2012, Anatel decided that the VU-M reference rates in 2014 would be 75% of the valid VU-M in 2013, and in 2015 it would be 50% of the valid VU-M in 2013. Besides the VU-M reduction, Anatel established a Bill & Keep, or B&K, between SMP and non-SMP PCSs. From January 2013 until February 2015, the B&K will be 80%/20%. From 2015 until 2016 the B&K will be 60%/40%. After 2016 the VU-M will be charged by the SMP whenever their network is used to originate or to finish a call. With respect to fixed interconnection, Anatel revised the criteria for pricing the use of fixed networks in May 2012. According to such regulation, after January 1, 2014, a full B&K regime (in which no payments are due for the traffic termination) was implemented for local STFC operators dealing with other local STFC operators. Currently, therefore, no payments are due for the use of a local STFC operator’s network by other local STFC operator. In November 2012, as part of the cost model transition, Anatel set out the 2014 mobile termination reference rate VU-M for operators with significant market power at 75% of the valid VU-M in 2013, and the 2015 reference rate VU-M at 50% of the valid VU-M in 2013. Based on that, in December 2013, VU-M prices for 2014 and 2015 were published in Resolution No. 600. Anatel should have released the cost modeling methods for 2016 onwards in 2013 as well, but did not. VU-M prices were to decline based on a glide path until the cost modeling known as LRIC+ Bottom Up is applied. However, this disclosure was postponed due to the need for major analysis on the tariff figures by Anatel. Rate Regulation Under our PCS authorizations, we are allowed to set prices for our service plans, subject to approval by Anatel, provided that such amounts do not exceed a specified inflation adjusted cap. Anatel currently uses the IST (Índice de Serviços de Telecomunicações), a general price inflation index developed by FGV, in evaluating prices and determining the relevant cap for prices charged in the telecommunications industry. Beginning in 2012, we expect Anatel to begin to assess prices in the telecommunications industry based on a model that takes into account the costs of a hypothetical company costs, along with other factors. We expect that the adjustment of our prices will follow the market trend, and that the adjustment will be below the annual inflation rate based on the IST. If this new inflation adjustment mechanism, or any other mechanism chosen by the Brazilian government in the future, does not adequately reflect the true effect of inflation on our prices, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 63 Table of Contents Number Portability In March 2007 Anatel issued a new regulation regarding number portability in Brazil for fixed telephony and PCS providers. Portability is limited to migration between providers of the same telecommunications services. For PCS providers, portability can take place when customer changes services provider within the same Registration Area as well as when customer changes the service plan of the same area. Anatel finished the nationwide NP implementation schedule in March 2009. Value-Added Services and Internet Regulation Value-added services are not considered under Brazilian telecommunications regulations to be telecommunications services, but rather an activity that adds features to a telecommunications service. Regulations require all telecommunications service providers to grant network access to any party interested in providing value-added services, on a non-discriminatory basis, unless technically impossible. Telecommunications service providers also are allowed to render value-added services through their own networks. Internet connection is considered by Brazilian legislation to be a value-added service, and its providers are not considered to be telecommunications companies. Current regulations allow us or any other interested party to offer Internet connection through our network. The Brazilian Congress is considering bill number 2,126/2011, known as the Legal Framework for the Use of the Internet (Marco Civil da Internet), which would establish warranties, principles, rights and duties related to Internet use and its provision. The project aims to develop regulations related to this service with a general framework. Among key issues addressed in the legislation are: net neutrality, responsibility for damages caused by content generated or published by third parties, content storage and connections. This law is also intended to develop guidelines for how the government can or should act to provide and monitor Internet service. The Marco Civil da Internet is being processed on a “constitutional urgency” fast track procedure and the Brazilian Congress are close to a political consensus to vote a final draft. Although a subject of great debate, Anatel seems to have expressed itself as the competent authority to regulate network neutrality. This conclusion can be drawn from their analysis of the request for approval for the acquisition of Brasil Telecom by Oi, in which a neutral treatment of the network was imposed. Furthermore, Anatel included regulation of network neutrality in the SCM Regulation proposal, submitted for public consultation in 2011, forbidding the blockage and discriminatory treatment of traffic, except for the procedures shown as essential for the safety and stability of the service and its supporting networks. Although such specific rules related to net neutrality were not confirmed in the final version of the SCM regulation, approved by Anatel in 2013, a general principle remained in the regulation that SCM providers must observe net neutrality principle, in accordance with Anatel’s regulations and the applicable law. Frequencies and Spectrum Background We have a license to operate PCS services in the 450 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1.8 GHz and 1.9/2.1 GHz and 2.5 Ghz frequency ranges, which allows us to provide mobile communications services with 2G, 3G and 4G technologies throughout Brazil. In connection with the PCS authorization auctions in 2001 and 2002, Anatel divided the Brazilian territory into three separate regions, each of which is equal to the regions applicable to the public regime fixed-line telephone service providers. PCS services could only be provided under Bands C, D and E at that time with initially 1800 MHz band and afterwards also the 900 MHz band. We acquired the D band in regions II and III and the E band in region I, completing our national coverage when considering TIM Sul, TIM Nordeste and Maxitel coverage. In December 2007, we acquired new authorizations for the 1800 MHz frequency in the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in order to improve our radio frequency capacity in these regions. Within the same auction, Claro and Vivo acquired authorizations to provide PCS services in regions where we historically provide services but where Claro and Vivo previously did not, using 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz bands, which has resulted in increased competition in these regions. In the same auction, Oi received authorization to provide PCS services in the state of São Paulo using 1800 MHz (band M in the whole state and band E in the state’s countryside). 64 Table of Contents In December 2010 Anatel auctioned an empty 3G band of radio spectrum consisting of (10+10) MHz in 2.1 GHz in the whole country (the “H Band” Auction), and other left over frequencies in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands that had not been assigned in previous auctions. · Of the 12 available lots in the H Band, 10 were awarded to Nextel, a new entrant in the GSM market, which has traditionally offered trunking services in Brazil. Current operators were prevented from participating due to spectrum caps. Oi and CTBC managed to win the remaining two lots where they had cap availability. · The new entrant will be benefited with spectrum and infrastructure sharing, specifically in locations with less than 30,000 inhabitants, subjected to commercial agreements. · TIM won individual block of frequencies in five service areas, strengthening its presence in the North, Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais and Parana, biding a total of R$81.8 million, which will be paid proportionately to the remaining years in the existing authorization licenses (remaining years/15). · VIVO won blocks in 900 MHz and due to available cap, managed to win lots of 1700/1800 MHz in all regions, completing a national coverage of (10+10) MHz in this band. · Claro won blocks of spectrum in the 1700/1800 MHz band. In December 2011, Anatel started auction No. 001/2011-PVCP/SPV, pursuant to which 16 blocks in the 1,800 MHz band were sold to Claro, Oi, CTBC and TIM. As a result of our participation in the auction, we will expand our 2G coverage and increase our presence in the northern and midwestern regions of Brazil, including the states of Paraná, Espirito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Minas Gerais. Our corresponding radiofrequency authorization periods were formalized with Anatel in May 2013, after Anatel ruled on an appeal challenging the bidding process outcome. In 2012, Anatel established a bidding process in order to comply with Presidential Decree No. 7.512 of June 2011, which set April 2012 as the deadline to auction the 2.5GHz band, in order to introduce 4G technology in Brazil. Anatel modeled the auction with 2 national blocks of (20+20)MHz (W and Z) and 2 national blocks of (10+10)MHz (V1 and V2). In order to guarantee full rural service by 2018, Anatel linked the 4G blocks to the 450MHz band in specific geographic regions of Brazil. By April 30, 2013, FIFA Confederations Cup host cities (Belo Horizonte, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Salvador and Brasília), in preparation for hosting the FIFA 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, were to have been served by 4G. Following the results of the auction in October 2012, TIM acquired for R$340 million the 2,530-2,540 MHz and 2650-2660 MHz sub-bands, with national coverage, and the 450 MHz band in Espírito Santo, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina states (the 450 MHz band was jointly acquired with Intelig). Certain 4G coverage commitments were effective as early as April 2013, while the first coverage commitments for the 450 MHz band are effective by June 2014. As of December 2013, we are providing 4G coverage to approximately 10% of the urban population of Brazil, including eight capital cities. In December 2013, we launched 4G in Natal, ahead of Anatel’s required schedule. Satisfaction of the these coverage commitments demands heavy capital investments and a commitment to acquire products with national technology, with R$1.5 billion to be invested in 4G alone over the next three years. We participated in the auction as a group bidding in the name of TIM and Intelig. We did not bid for the W block (Amazonas as a rural area), which we viewed as having a high premium if compared to the X block (67%), whereas we successfully acquired the V1 block, which in our view held the best CAPEX/OPEX profile associated with rural services in its selected regions (RJ, ES, SC and PR). The joint bid allowed us to take advantage of the flexibility of the auction rules. These bands brought heavy coverage obligations as its short range characteristics demands large investments. The year 2013 began with indications from the government and Anatel that they hoped to speed up the move to digitalization of TV in Brazil. In November 2013, Anatel approved the dedication of a single band exclusively to mobile services. The objective is to free a “digital dividend” band, of the 700MHz spectrum, attributed to mobile services and free of TV channels, allowing the band to be auctioned off in 2014. The rules of the Digitalization Plan and the auction have not been clarified and we believe that in some cities this schedule will not be met, making it 65 Table of Contents necessary to have specific plans per region. The 700MHz spectrum with its long range and good penetration characteristics is very important to support rural obligations and city coverage but given its proximity of the 2.5GHz auction and the attendant obligations already in deployment, the 700MHz band loses some of its value in network synergy and infrastructure deployment. In addition, Anatel is expected to auction bandwidths in the 3.5 GHz and 10.5 GHz (WI-MAX) spectrum to provide broadband wireless and fixed telephony services, though it is uncertain when these auctions will occur, as they have been delayed due to certain issues regarding band attribution and interference issues. We are still analyzing whether to bid for this bandwidth when and if it becomes available. Were we to bid, there is no assurance that our bids will be successful. Purchasers of these bandwidths could potentially offer services that could compete with our services. VU-M and Wholesale Market The interconnection of telecommunication operators is mandatory, allowing the users of different services to make calls from one network to another. In the case of PCS, Anatel has established that, whenever its network is used to originate or to receive calls, the operators will receive the Value of Use of Mobile Network (Valor de Uso de Rede Móvel), or VU-M, also known as an interconnection rate or mobile termination rate, set by free agreement. Anatel urged us to adopt a single VU-M per region, as such region is set out in the PCS License General Plan (Plano Geral de Autorizações), or PGA, which began on November 1, 2010. We declined to do so and instead choose to commercially negotiate VU-Ms with different providers. Under current regulations, VU-M rates may currently be negotiated among operators with reference rates only applied by Anatel in case of dispute. October 2011, Anatel decided to reduce fixed to mobile rates, based on a reduction in the respective wholesale interconnection levels on call termination. Anatel proposed a reduction of the fixed to mobile rates of 18% in 2012 and 12% in 2013, based on nominal declines. In the future, Anatel intends to establish the reference tariffs for operators with significant market power based on the fully allocated historic costs system, which reference tariffs are already under development by Anatel in consultation with a consortium formed by three companies (Advisia, Analysis Mason and Grant Thornton). The contract signed in August 2011 between Anatel and the consortium provides for a cost model in the amount of $8.22 million, which corresponding rules are expected to be effective by 2014 and which will likely imply a reduction of the mobile termination rate. We believe the rate reductions put in place by Anatel fail to consider the need to preserve PCS market competition, and we filed an administrative appeal with Anatel, which was denied in December 2012. In November 2012, as part of the cost model transition, Anatel set the 2014 mobile termination reference rate VU-M for operators with significant market power in the mobile network inbound calls market at 75% of the valid VU-M in 2013, and the 2015 reference rate VU-M at 50% of the valid VU-M in 2013. Based on that, in December 2013, VU-M prices were published in Resolution No. 600 for 2014 and 2015. Anatel should have released the cost modeling methods for 2016 onwards in 2013 as well, but did not. As previously noted, Anatel classified us as belonging to economic groups with significant market power in the mobile network termination market to which these cost models apply. We believe, however, that when Anatel adopted such decisions, it failed to observe the proper administrative process required to issue new regulations. We have filed an annulment application with Anatel in connection with the November 2012 resolution, which is still under review by Anatel. Accordingly, we understand the VU-M prices contained in Resolution No. 600 may only be imposed on us after Anatel has ruled on our annulment application. Accordingly, we have filed an administrative appeal with Anatel, which is still under review by Anatel. Industrial Exploration of Dedicated Lines In December 2010, Anatel approved a public hearing that considered alterations of the Industrial Exploration of Dedicated Lines (Exploração Industrial de Linha Dedicada) or EILD, which established mechanisms for the operation of transmissions circuits to increase transparency between operators and concessionaires. In May 2012, Anatel approved the new EILD regulations (Regulação de Exploração Industrial de Linha Dedicada) or REILD, or REILD, detailing mechanisms to optimize the operating structure for transmission loop contracts in order to increase 66 Table of Contents contract price transparency and affording equal treatment to independent service providers from concessionaire groups. The REILD specifically sets out more effective rules on project definition including Standard EILD or Special EILD, in addition to contract and delivery terms, and specifies EILD delivery dispute resolution procedures. Concurrently, in May 2012, Anatel approved new EILD reference prices, substantially lower than those previously in place, and a step towards value fixation in disputes between service providers. According to the new REILD, contracts executed prior to its implementation should be amended within 120 days from publication. We have started discussions to amend our EILD contracts, though we have found it necessary to ask Anatel’s intervention to solve certain disputes. While the new REILD provides procedures for promptly resolving disputes involving the provision of dedicated lines, Oi has taken legal actions that are delaying the actual amendment of the EILD contracts we have with them. Considering that EILD is also a market subject to the asymmetric regulation defined by Anatel in the PGMC, operators classified by Anatel as pertaining to group with significant market power in the EILD market, such as Oi, were required to submit reference prices and offers for Anatel’s approval. In September 2013, Anatel approved reference prices and offers of the operators with significant market power in the EILD market. We are not currently classified as having significant market power in the EILD market. Costs Modeling The implementation of a costs model by Anatel has been in development since March 2005, when the Separation and Allocation of Accounts Document (Documento de Separação e Alocação de Contas), or DSAC was approved, for pricing of STFC and PCS interconnection, as well as wholesale market inputs, in particular with regards to dedicated lines (EILD) and unbundling. In August 2011, a consortium headed by Advisia Consultants was hired to develop the optimized modeling of costs, which will be the basis for all the models the agency will use, in particular when establishing rates and prices of telecommunications services. The implementation of the costs model was one of the short term goals set by the PGR, with expectation of conclusion in 2013, however, its technical complexity indicates that it will only be effective at the end of 2014. In December 2012, Anatel held, in Brasilia, the International Seminar on Modeling and costs. The event aimed to provide an overview of the model development costs in the region of the Americas and Brazil. Some meetings have taken since this time to discuss changes in the cost model with national operators. In September 2013, Anatel submitted for public comment a draft of its rule on pricing of STFC and PCS interconnection, as well as EILD, based on a cost model. Such rule and the corresponding reference amounts are still under development by Anatel. According to the proposal submitted for public comment, reference amounts based on cost model will come into force in 2016, and were to be published by the Agency by December 2013. Although such referent amounts based on cost model have yet to be published publication did not occur, they are expected to be released by Anatel in 2014. See – “Interconnection Regulation.” Migration of the Mobile Networks with Analog Technology In February 2011, Anatel approved Resolution No. 562/11, which modified a provision of the regulation on conditions of use of radiofrequencies, determining that, after a period of 360 days from the publication, the use of analog technology in radiofrequencies sub bands of 800 MHz would no longer be allowed. In relation to the use of such radiofrequencies, we no longer have any subscriber of analog technology (AMPS). However, our analog networks are still used by STFC concessionaires to provide services to subscribers in rural areas of the country, a service called RuralCel. The implementation of the RuralCel service was carried out by the companies in the Telebrás system, prior to the privatization process in 1998. Once the privatization of these companies was completed, SMC operators are 67 Table of Contents required to keep sharing such infrastructure (mobile networks with analog technology) with STFC concessionaires with rural subscribers. There is a dispute with STFC concessionaires as to the compensation payable for the availability of the RuralCel support network. Anatel decided to temporarily postpone shutting down this service, but only until March 2016. We continue to interact with the regulating agency regarding the shutdown of our analog mobile networks. Regulation of Quality In October 2011, Anatel published PCS and SCM quality management regulations to establish quality parameters which were to have been met by the mobile telephone and Internet connection operators in up to 12 months. Most quality parameters established became effective in October and November 2012. Among such quality parameters, most notable are the ones relating to the quality of the networks, both mobile and fixed, creating obligations of minimum and average speeds in numbers, higher that those currently used by operators, which required investments so that such obligations could be met. As a response to the need to better quantify the financial impacts, Grupo Oi has presented cancellation request along with a revision request to Anatel for the presentation of technical surveys of the economic impacts of the new regulations. The aforementioned request was submitted for a public hearing by Anatel, which resulted in a series of differing opinions regarding quality measures by the different operations that are currently being considered by Anatel. With regard to STFC, Anatel approved in December 2012 the Quality Management Regulation for STFC service providers, the purpose of which is the creation of a new quality management model available, such as Quality Management Regulation for PCS and SCM. In February 2013, Anatel published STFC quality management regulations to establish quality parameters which should be met by fixed telephone operators in 120 days. All parameters established became effective in June 2013. Consolidation of TIM and Intelig STFC Licenses With the acquisition of Intelig by TIM Participações, we were required to eliminate the existing overlapping licenses in order to abide by regulations. We were given 18 months to implement these changes, beginning on the date of closing of the transaction. This term was later extended for an additional 12 months, expiring on June 30, 2012. On December 30, 2011 we filed petitions with Anatel to authorize the consolidation of our STFC license terms in the local mode under Intelig and STFC LDN and LDI under TIM. On June 30, 2012 we returned CSP 23 to Anatel, keeping the operation of STFC LDN and LDI bound to CSP 41 TIM Celular S.A. license, whereas Intelig keep the STFC local license. The amendments to the STFC Instrument of Authorization executed between TIM/Intelig and Anatel providing on the foregoing statutes were published on October 26, 2012. On August 29, 2012, the companies TIM Fiber SP and TIM Fiber RJ formalized before Anatel their waiver of SCM exploration authorizations. Promptly thereafter, both companies were merged into TIM Celular S.A, which is already authorized to provide such services. Anatel terminated the SCM authorizations held by TIM Fiber SP and TIM Fiber RJ. Upon absorption of TIM Fiber SP and TIM Fiber RJ, TIM Celular S.A, as successor in interest, became the provider of the services previously provided by these companies. Inclusion of ninth digit in several areas In December 2010, Anatel published Resolution No. 553/2010, determining the inclusion of one more digit for mobile numbers in the 011 area code region, which includes the city of São Paulo and neighboring cities. The 68 Table of Contents change requires users to add the digit 9 to the beginning of existing mobile numbers. Anatel’s decision to add one more digit to mobile phone numbers in the 011 area code was intended to increase the availability of numbers in the metropolitan area of São Paulo from 37 million to 90 million, as it is expected that availability of mobile numbers would end by 2013 at the current rate of subscription growth. The ninth digit was successfully implemented on July 29, 2012. This measure requires residents of the 011 area code region to carry out possible adjustments to private equipment and systems such as, for example, PABX equipment and phone lists, in addition to technical adjustments carried out by telecommunication companies. Technical, Communications and Regulatory work groups have been created by representatives of all PCS and STFC operators, in order to prepare for the implementation of the ninth digit in a synchronized way for all the operators, with standardized communication to avoid adjustment difficulties for users. After July 29, 2012, calls to mobile numbers using the 8 digits were still completed for a 90-day period, to allow networks and users to adapt. During these 90 days, operators implemented gradual interceptions and users received messages with guidance on how to dial. After this transition period, calls to mobile numbers dialed with 8 digits were no longer completed. The ninth digit was implemented in all the remaining areas of the state of São Paulo on August 25, 2013, and in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo on October 27, 2013. Anatel has defined the terms for implementing the ninth digit in PCS in other locations in Brazil, as follows: Term State National Codes January 31, 2014 Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro 21, 22, 24, 27, and 28 December 31, 2014 Amapá, Amazonas, Maranhão, Pará, and Roraima 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 99 December 31, 2015 Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Sergipe 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 71, 73, 74, 75, 77, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, and 89 December 31, 2016 Acre, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Rondônia, Santa Catarina, Tocantins 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 55, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, and 69 Anatel Administrative Proceedings Under the terms of its PCS authorization, TIM Celular implemented mobile personal telecommunications coverage for the assigned area. Under such term of authorization, TIM Celular is required to operate in accordance with the quality standards established by Anatel. If it fails to meet the minimum quality standards required, TIM Celular is subject to Obligation Non-Compliance Determination Procedures, or PADO, and applicable penalties. Anatel has brought administrative proceedings against the TIM Group for (1) noncompliance with certain quality service indicators (PGMQ); and (2) default of certain other obligations assumed under the Terms of Authorization and pertinent regulations (Resolution nº.477). In its defense before Anatel, the TIM Group attributed the lack of compliance to items beyond its control and not related to its activities and actions. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings at this time, but have accrued the amount in our balance sheet as a provision for all those cases in which we estimate our loss to be probable. C. Organizational Structure Substantially all assets held by TIM Participações consist of the shares of its wholly-owned subsidiaries TIM Celular (incorporated in the Federative Republic of Brazil and headquarters located in the State of São Paulo), and Intelig (incorporated in the Federative Republic of Brazil and headquarters located in the State of Rio de Janeiro). 69 Table of Contents The following chart illustrates our current ownership structure: D. Property, Plants and Equipment Our principal properties consist of transmission equipment, switching equipment, which connect calls to and from customers, and radio base stations, which comprise certain signal transmission and reception equipment covering a defined area. At our radio base stations we have also installed antennas and certain equipment to connect these antennas with our switching equipment. As of December 31, 2013, we had 124 MGW, 79 MSC-S, 412 radio controller stations, 9,074 B Nodes, 911 eB Nodes, 12,473 BTS and approximately 47,000 kilometers in fiber optic cable networks. We generally lease or buy the sites where our mobile telecommunications network equipment is installed. On December 31, 2013, we owned approximately 202,752 square meters and leased approximately 1,231,486 square meters of real property, all of which were available for installation of our equipment. We also lease approximately 158,777 square meters and owns approximately 70,201 square meters of office space. There are no material encumbrances that may affect our utilization of our property or equipment. For the years 2014 through 2016, we plan to invest up to R$11 billion in capital expenditures, according to our strategic plan presented to Anatel in 2013, around 90% of which will be invested in constructing, expanding, improving and buying network improvements, such as deploying more antennas and adding capacity to the antennas we already own. Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects A. Operating Results Our first financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS were those as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements were filed with the CVM and made publicly available in Brazil. Our summary financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS is not comparable with our summary financial data prepared in accordance Brazilian GAAP and presented in previous annual reports on Form 20-F. The following discussion of the Company’s financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 included in this annual report that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, issued by IASB as well as with the information presented under “Item 3. Key Information—A. Selected Financial Data.” 70 Table of Contents Brazilian Political and Economic Overview During 2013, the continued uncertainty in Europe, particularly in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, intensified concerns regarding the fiscal sustainability and risk of sovereign default of those countries, reducing the confidence of international investors and bringing volatility to the markets. Further, although the U.S. growth for the remainder of 2013 remained low given higher savings requirements, tighter fiscal policy and low global growth rates. The continued financial deterioration of these countries appears to have impaired the global economy and, in consequence, economic growth in Brazil decelerated in 2013, with GDP growing just 2.3% annually. Nevertheless, domestic demand remains strong and consumption is on pace with recent growth, which is also affecting inflation. The official inflation rate was 5.91% in 2013, above both the 5.84% recorded in 2012 and the 4.5% rate targeted by the Central Bank, though falling within the “oscillating” band of plus or minus two percentage points considered acceptable by the Central Bank. Inflation was negatively impacted by food and transportation, which increased 8.48% and 3.29%, respectively. Efforts by the Brazilian government to stimulate the economy were reversed in 2013 due to inflationary pressure. As of December 31, 2013, the SELIC rate was 10.00%. Inflation directly impacts our results of operations, as certain of our assets and liabilities are subject to inflation adjustment, although the impact of these adjustments has not been material during the reported periods. In 2013, the net impact of inflation adjustments was a loss of R$57.3 million and in 2012 was a gain of R$3.4 million. The loss in 2013 can be explained by losses due to inflation adjustment on provisions for regulatory contingencies and, to a lesser extent, inflation adjustments on a R$116 million loan from BNDES, offset in part by adjustment gains on judgments awarded to us and, to a substantially lesser extent, inflation adjustment gains on contracts. In addition to the foregoing direct impacts, if inflation rises, disposable income of families may decrease in real terms, leading to lack of purchasing power among our customer base. Measures to combat inflation, such as a tight monetary policy with high interest rates, result in restrictions on credit and short-term liquidity, further decreasing the purchasing power of our customers. Insofar as domestic demand is concerned, economists expect that consumption will continue to expand due to a record-low unemployment rate, wage increases, availability of consumer credit and the ongoing economic recovery. The balance of fixed assets is also expected to grow based on the growth in industrial output. The Brazilian current account closed the year with a deficit of U.S.$81.37 billion or 3.66% of GDP, an increase in the deficit from 2012 when the deficit reached U.S.$60.24 billion. The 2013 deficit was the highest recorded since the Central Bank began recording this metric in 1947. The primary cause for this result was the decrease of 86.6% in the trade balance surplus. Direct external investments totaled U.S.$100.59 billion, an increase of U.S.$10.22 billion compared to 2012. The trend of a depreciating real reversed temporarily in the first quarter of 2013, with the real reaching R$1.95 per U.S.$1.00 in early March 2013, only to continue its depreciation throughout much of the rest of the year, ending the year at R$2.34 per U.S. $1.00. By December 31, 2013, the U.S. dollar had appreciated 15.37% versus the real. The 2013 balance of payments registered a deficit of U.S.$4.9 billion, representing a 125.9% decrease when compared to the surplus of U.S.$18.9 billion registered in 2012. After the expansion of government expenditures and decrease in government surplus in 2010, which was influenced by the electoral year, the government surplus increased. In 2011, the accumulated surplus reached R$93.5 billion, as compared to R$78.8 billion accumulated in 2010, an increase of 18.7%. As a share of GDP, government expenditures decreased from 21.1% in 2010 to 20.7% in 2011. In 2012, the accumulated surplus reached R$88.5 billion, as compared to R$93.5 billion accumulated in 2011, a decrease of 5.3%. As a share of GDP, government expenditures rose from 20.7% in 2011 to 21.5% in 2012. The Brazilian mobile market reached 271.1 million lines nationwide at the end of December 2013, corresponding to a penetration ratio of 136.4% (compared to 132.8% in 2012) and an annual growth rate of 3.5% (compared to 8.1% in 2012). Brazil is the fifth largest mobile telephony market in the world, and telephony is 71 Table of Contents currently the most common means of communication in Brazilian households among all social classes. According to Anatel, mobile market net adds reached 9.3 million in 2013 which represents a 52.5% downturn from 2012’s 19.6 million net adds. Prepaid subscribers continue to represent the greatest part of total subscriber base, reaching 211.6% by the end of 2013. Our subscriber base ended 2013 with 73.4 million clients, a 4.3% increase from 2012, corresponding to a market share of 27.1%, making us the second largest mobile operator in the market. Our prepaid business reached 61.1 million clients (an 2.5% increase from 2012), maintaining the position of leader in this important business. Our postpaid business had 12.3 million users at the end of 2013, a 14.6% increase from 2012. With regard to our client mix, postpaid clients accounted for 15.8% of our total subscriber base, compared to 15.2% in 2012. In 2013, we added 3.1 million customers, down from 6.3 million in 2012. Our ARPU was R$18.6 in 2013. On a yearly basis, ARPU saw a decline of 2.4%, partially attributed to the VU-M cut and long distance calls commoditization. ARPU is a key performance indicator which is calculated for any period as total net service revenue divided by average customer base. In 2013, our average customer base, calculated as the simple mean of monthly averages, increased 5.3% to 71.7 million, compared to 68.0 million customers in 2012. The following table shows the total average number of customers during 2013, 2012 and 2011. Year ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands of users) Average number of customers using postpaid plans(1) 11,152 10,004 8,263 Average number of customers using prepaid plans(1) 60,564 58,042 48,457 Total number of customers(1) 71,714 68,046 56,720 (1) Average numbers are based on the number of customers at the end of each month during the relevant year, including December of the previous year. Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations Acquisition of AES Atimus On July 8, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary TIM Celular entered into an agreement with Companhia Brasiliana de Energia and AES Elpa (the AES Group in Brazil) for the purchase of all of AES Elpa’s equity interests in Eletropaulo Telecomunicações and 98.3% of the interest of AES RJ. We completed the acquisition on October 31, 2011, after all conditions precedent were satisfied and certain regulatory approvals obtained. We paid a total of R$1,074,179 thousand and R$447,471 thousand, respectively, for each of Eletropaulo Telecomunicações and AES RJ. In connection with the acquisition, Eletropaulo Telecomunicações changed its corporate name to TIM Fiber SP Ltda., and AES RJ changed its corporate name to TIM Fiber RJ S.A., and we call the business, collectively, TIM Fiber. In August 2012, TIM Fiber was merged into TIM Celular. In connection with such merger, TIM Celular assumed TIM Fiber’s service obligations, thereby ensuring continuity of services. The AES Atimus Acquisition has allowed us to expand our operations in the household broadband and high-speed data communications markets, thereby permitting us to offer new products to our customers including our Live TIM service, a high quality ultra-broadband available to households in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The AES Atimus Acquisition also provided a reduction in infrastructure rental costs, while helping us to obtain significant synergies related to our existing fiber optic network. We continued throughout 2013 to expand the neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo where our Live TIM service is available. In July 2013, Live TIM received the Customer Service Innovation award from the magazine Global Telecom Business. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, included net revenues of R$22,594 thousand and a loss of R$19,406 thousand relating to the businesses acquired in the AES Atimus Acquisition for the period from November 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. 72 Table of Contents In the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred R$15 million in costs attributable to the AES Atimus Acquisition, which are recorded under general and administrative expenses. The table below summarizes the amount paid to acquire control of Eletropaulo Telecomunicações and AES RJ, as well as the fair value of the non-controlling interest at October 31, 2011, the acquisition date. Provisional Amounts As of October 31, 2011 Eletropaulo Telecomunicações AES RJ (thousands of reais) Cash and cash equivalents 1,074,179 447,471 Fair value of non-controlling interest acquired — 7,938 Total consideration 1,074,179 455,409 Net assets reported by the acquired company 125,281 111,637 Provisional goodwill reported 948,898 343,772 Since this is a complex evaluation, we focused our efforts on identifying the main factors for completing the AES Atimus Acquisition and, as mentioned above, the main factors were the possibility of increasing product offerings in the corporate business line and the launch of residential broadband service, which we believe represents an opportunity for us to obtain a return on assets purchased in excess of the return currently earned by these businesses, and therefore are not allocated to any specific assets and liabilities, being instead recorded as goodwill. Based on management’s assessment, the value of the purchase price premium is substantially composed of synergies, cost reductions and expected future profitability. The purchase price allocations, or PPA, related to the AES Atimus Acquisition were concluded on October 31, 2012, and retroactively recorded in the Company’s financial statements, as required under IFRS. The following tables summarize the effects recorded in the opening balance sheets of the companies acquired in the AES Atimus Acquisition.

As required for all goodwill, recoverability is tested annually through an impairment test. In 2013, the impairment test utilized the “value in use” methodology, as further illustrated in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Though the network synergies related to the AES Atimus Acquisition exist and may be used in the calculation of “value in use,” these amounts were not considered in the impairment tests, the results of which did not indicate the need the record an impairment provision. Furthermore, no reasonable change in assumptions would trigger an impairment. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most subjective, complex judgments, often requiring management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increases, those judgments become more complex. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience, industry trends or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate, and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported financial results. In order to provide an understanding about how our management has estimated the potential impact of certain uncertainties, including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates, we have identified the critical accounting policies discussed below. We describe our significant accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets. See Note 4(l) to our consolidated financial statements. We currently depreciate automatic switching, transmission and other equipment based on an estimated useful life of seven years. We review our long-lived assets, such as goodwill, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. At least annually, the Company applies the recoverability test on the recorded goodwill. The calculations were performed based on the discounted cash flow using as parameters the assumptions included in the Company’s three year industrial plan, growth rate compatible with our market conditions and a discount rate of between 12.5% and 13% per year. 75 Table of Contents The fair value of the cash generating units, as of the latest impairment testing date, is substantially in excess of their carrying value. However, asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. If our projections are not met, we may have to record impairment charges not previously recognized. In analyzing potential impairments, we use projections based on our view of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic, regulatory and political conditions and changes in technology. Such projections are subject to change, including as a result of technological developments that may render long-lived assets obsolete sooner than anticipated. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments. We revise our estimated percentage of losses on a regular basis, taking into account our most recent experience with non-payments (i.e. average percentage of receivables historically written-off, economic conditions and the length of time the receivables are past due). The provision for doubtful accounts for 2013 was based on the following estimates of percentages of receivables, classified by the number of days such receivables are overdue, that it projected to be uncollectible. These estimates were based on historical experience of write-offs and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectability of accounts. The amount of the loss, if any, that we actually experience with respect to these accounts may differ from the amount of the allowance maintained in connection with them. Days overdue Percentage estimated to be uncollectible Current* 2.75% - 3.5 % Receivables overdue 1 to 90 days* 5.5% - 7 % Receivables overdue 91 to 120 days 50 % Receivables overdue 121 to 150 days 56 % Receivables overdue 151 to 180 days 90 % Receivables overdue more than 180 days 100 % * Percentage varies based on area and customer composition. Deferred Income Tax and Social Contribution We compute and pay income taxes based on results of operations under IFRS. We regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability. If, based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income and expected timing of reversals we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. When performing such reviews, we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income. In order to determine future taxable income, we need to estimate future taxable revenues and deductible expenses, which are subject to different external and internal factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, interest rates, shifts in our business strategy and changes in the type of services we offer. The use of different assumptions and estimates could significantly change our financial statements. A change in assumptions and estimates with respect to our expected future taxable income could result in the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets, which would decrease our results of operations and shareholders’ equity. If we operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, if the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if there is any change in our future projections, we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results. 76 Table of Contents The taxable income projections used in determining the recoverability of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009 were derived from our 2010-2012 Industrial Plan. At that time, our Industrial Plan forecasted our income for the following three fiscal years, with assumptions reflecting conditions we expected to exist and the course of actions we expect to take. Based on the three-year projections included in our Industrial Plan, we projected income out for a further seven years (to 2019). However, we did not extend our Industrial Plan projections beyond the basic three years for the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets because we believe that the uncertainties described below made any extension of our projections difficult to support at the more-likely-than-not level, required for projections in this context. We limited our projections to three years in determining the amount of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009. The principal uncertainties underlying our decision to limit the projections to three years at December 31, 2009 were: · TIM Celular had a history of losses; · at the end of 2009, Brazil was expecting a presidential election in 2010, generating uncertainties in relation to longer future projections and taxation; · at the end of 2009, the economy was still recovering from the worldwide financial crises, generating a strong level of uncertainties in longer term future projections. In addition, we believed there was significant uncertainty regarding the Brazilian economy, including with respect to domestic inflation and commodities prices; and · in 2009, compared to 2008, the subsidiary TIM Celular did not experience growth in revenues and had a modest growth in profitability. Further, as described before in this Form, the Company lost approximately five hundred thousand clients from its average postpaid customer during 2009 when compared to 2008, and had a deterioration in its brand awareness and customers satisfaction. As a result, substantial efforts were made to turn around the Company (including the subsidiary TIM Celular) starting in the second half of 2009, including: (1) a substantial change in management (e.g. CEO, COO, CTO); (2) re-launching of the strategy and positioning of TIM in the market; (3) new and innovative services and products (“Infinity” and “Liberty”). In addition to the above uncertainties, we also considered the inherent subjectivity of the positive evidence underlying our projections of future taxable income, such as the expectation that new management and a new business plan at TIM Celular would lead to a turnaround at that business. In evaluating the negative and positive evidence in assessing the likelihood of predicable earnings after 2012, we believed that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence. As a result of all of the foregoing, we believed that the valuation allowance as at December 31, 2009 was necessary because our projections showed that the deferred tax assets were not recoverable to the extent of the allowance. By the end of 2010, TIM Celular had clear evidence of the success of the strategy implemented during 2009. Accordingly, our actual 2010 results were significantly better than those we considered in our projections prepared in the end of 2009. The main positive factors that lead TIM Celular to better results were: · 2010 final customer base of 51 million, showing an additional 4.6 million in new customers when compared to the projected customer base. Revenues were higher by approximately R$200 million in comparison to projected revenues; · efficiency plans effectiveness. During 2010, our costs and expenses were lower by approximately R$250 million in comparison to the projected amounts, partially due to cost saving programs and partially due to synergies from Tim Nordeste merging process; · success of the new products (“Infinity” and “Liberty”) launched during 2009; · progressive exit from offering handset subsidies; 77 Table of Contents · significant reduction of handsets classified as property, plant and equipment (handsets owned by the Company and provided free of charge to corporate customers) with consequent reduction in depreciation (actual depreciation amount in 2010 was lower by R$300 million in relation to projected depreciation); and · increase in cash generation, resulting in reduced indebtedness and lower net financial expenses (financial expenses were approximately R$100 million lower than the expected in the projections). Considering the reduction in the uncertainties we had at the end of 2009, as of December 31, 2010 we updated our business plan for the years 2011-2013 and subsequent projections based on our belief that future income generation would be higher than expected at the end of 2009. Based on the expected taxable income to be generated in future years and the growing stability of the economy after the uncertainty in 2009, at the end of 2010 we released in its entirety the valuation allowance for tax loss carry forwards related to our subsidiary TIM Celular that was recorded at December 31, 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Company continued to generate taxable income in line with projections approved in the 2010 business plan. Asset Retirement Obligations Our subsidiaries are contractually obligated to dismantle their cellular towers from various sites they lease. We must record as asset retirement obligations the present value of the estimated costs to be incurred for dismantling and removing cellular towers and equipment from leased sites. The offset to this provision is recorded as property, plant and equipment, and the depreciation is calculated based on the useful lives of the corresponding assets. Contingent Liabilities The accrual for a contingency involves considerable judgment to be performed by management. A contingency is “an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.” We are subject to various claims, including regulatory, legal and labor proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We adopted the policy of analyzing each proceeding and making a judgment as to whether a loss is probable, possible or remote. We account for accruals when we determine that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our judgment is always based on the opinion of our external legal advisors. Accrual balances may be adjusted to account for changes in circumstances relating to ongoing matters and we may establish additional accruals for new matters. While we believe that the current level of accruals is adequate, changes in the future could impact these determinations. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recorded when services are rendered. As a result of our billing cycle cut-off times, we are required to make estimates for services revenue earned but not yet billed. These estimates, which are based primarily upon unbilled minutes of use, could differ from our actual calculation. See Notes 4(u) and 5(g) to our consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with “
