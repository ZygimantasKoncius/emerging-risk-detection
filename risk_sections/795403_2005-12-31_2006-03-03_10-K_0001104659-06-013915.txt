Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. We face intense competition and, if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets, our revenues may decrease. Competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. We encounter intense competition in all areas of our business. Additionally, customers for our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventories and their transaction costs. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position. In addition, we anticipate that we may have to reduce the prices of some of our products to stay competitive, potentially resulting in a reduction in the profit margin for, and inventory valuation of, these products. Some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices in foreign currencies. Accordingly, currency fluctuations could cause our U.S. dollar-priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products which are priced in other currencies. Reductions or interruptions in the supply of raw materials and increases in the costs of raw materials could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our ability to meet our customer delivery commitments. We require substantial amounts of raw materials, including bronze, brass, cast iron, steel and plastic and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The availability and costs of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and worldwide price and demand levels. We are not currently party to any long-term supply agreements. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products at favorable costs, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing our profit margins and by hindering our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. The costs of many of these raw materials are at the highest levels that they have been in many years. We may continue to experience further cost increases of these materials. In 2005, cost increases in raw materials were not completely recovered by increased selling prices or other product cost reductions. If we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of these cost increases through lowering other costs of production or successfully implementing price increases to our customers, such cost increases from our vendors could continue to have a negative effect on our financial results. Additionally, we continue to purchase increased levels of finished product from international sources. If there is an interruption in delivering these finished products to our domestic warehouses, this could have a negative effect on our financial results. Implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or our profitability. One of our strategies is to increase our revenues and profitability and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary water-related products and increase market share for our existing product lines. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Also, companies acquired recently and in the future may not achieve revenues, profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them. We expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions. In particular, we expect that management will need to devote a significant amount of time and effort over the next twelve months to improve the operational results of our recently acquired subsidiary, Core Industries 14 Inc., including improvements in its profitability, customer satisfaction and revenue growth rate. If we are not successful in implementing these improvements, our financial results may be negatively affected. We have faced increasing competition for acquisition candidates which have resulted in significant increases in the purchase prices of many acquisition candidates. This competition, and the resulting purchase price increases, may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us, possibly leading to a decrease in the rate of growth of our revenues and profitability. In addition, acquisitions may involve a number of special risks, including, but not limited to: · adverse short-term effects on our reported operating results; · diversion of managements attention; · investigations of, or challenges to, acquisitions by competition authorities; · loss of key personnel at acquired companies; and · unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities. We are subject to risks related to product defects, which could result in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability limitations. We maintain strict quality controls and procedures, including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products. However, we cannot be certain that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products or the materials from which they are made, which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will occur, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a product recall occurs during the products warranty period, we may be required to replace the defective product. In addition, a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers. Our insurance policies may not cover the costs of a product recall. Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us. We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products. If these additional expenses are significant, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Down economic cycles, particularly reduced levels of residential and non-residential starts and remodeling, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles. The businesses of most of our customers, particularly plumbing and heating wholesalers and home improvement retailers, are cyclical. Therefore, the level of our business activity has been cyclical, fluctuating with economic cycles. We also believe our level of business activity is influenced by residential and non-residential starts and renovation and remodeling, which are, in turn, heavily influenced by interest rates, consumer debt levels, changes in disposable income, employment growth and consumer confidence. Prime interest rates have increased by 38.1% since December 31, 2004. If these and other factors cause a material reduction in residential and non-residential and remodeling starts, our revenues and profits would decrease and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 15 Economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results. Since we sell and manufacture our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: · trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, which could increase our costs of doing business internationally; · potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws, which could have an adverse impact on our profits; · difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, which could reduce our productivity; · costs of compliance with differing labor regulations, especially in connection with restructuring our overseas operations; · natural disasters and public health emergencies; · laws of some foreign countries, which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States; and · unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, which may be costly and require time to implement. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect our reported results. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies, as a portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Approximately 37.0% of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2005 were from sales outside of the U.S. compared to 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales of approximately $2.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on sales of approximately $20.9 million and $31.1 million, respectively. Additionally, our Canadian operations require significant amounts of U.S. purchases for their operations. Instead of buying or manufacturing domestically, we currently have a favorable cost structure for goods we source from our joint venture, our wholly owned subsidiaries in China and our outside vendors. In 2005, China revalued its currency higher against the U.S. dollar and stated it would no longer tie the yuan to a fixed rate against the U.S. currency. The yuan was revalued to 8.11 yuan per dollar from 8.28, or 2.1%. At December 31, 2005, the yuan was valued at 8.07. China also stated it will now peg the yuan against numerous currencies, although it will keep the yuan in a tight band rather than letting it trade freely. If our share of revenue in non-dollar denominated currencies continues to increase in future periods, exchange rate fluctuations will likely have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition. There are risks in expanding our manufacturing operations and acquiring companies in China. As part of our strategy, we are shifting a portion of our manufacturing operations to China to reduce our production costs and to sell product into the Chinese market. This shift will subject a greater portion of our operations to the risks of doing business in China. The increased production levels in China require increased levels of working capital as we are rapidly increasing headcount and manufacturing equipment. If we are unable to quickly train these new employees we may experience product quality issues. The Chinese central and local government authorities have a higher degree of control over our businesses in China than is customary in many of the countries in which we operate and makes the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approval in China inherently unpredictable. In addition, the protection accorded our 16 proprietary technology and know-how under the Chinese legal system is not as strong as in the United States and, as a result, we may lose valuable trade secrets and competitive advantage. We expect to increase our participation in the Chinese water and power infrastructure markets with the consummation of our acquisition of Changsha Valve Works (Changsha), which we signed an agreement to acquire in October 2005. The acquisition of Changsha remains subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions by Changsha. Changsha sells exclusively into the domestic Chinese marketplace and deals in long-term contracts. If we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher utilization levels, our results of operations could be adversely affected. The equipment and management systems necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities may break-down, perform poorly or fail, resulting in fluctuations in our ability to manufacture our products and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. We operate a number of manufacturing facilities, all of which are subject to this risk, and such fluctuations at any of these facilities could cause an increase in our production costs and a corresponding decrease in our profitability. We also have a vertically-integrated manufacturing process. Each segment is dependent upon the prior process and any breakdown in one segment will adversely affect all later components. Fluctuations in our production process may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. Our inability to meet our delivery obligations could result in a loss of our customers and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have an ongoing manufacturing restructuring program to reduce our manufacturing costs. As we transition more of our operations overseas as a result of the manufacturing restructuring plan, we are transferring capacity utilization. If our planned manufacturing plant consolidations in the United States and Europe and our production capability expansion in China are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance and regulatory approvals, our revenues and our profitability may decrease. Our failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business, either of which may adversely affect our revenues. Our industry is characterized by: · intense competition; · changes in specifications required by our customers, plumbing codes and/or regulatory agencies; · technically complex products; and · constant improvement to existing products and introductions of new products. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer, on a timely basis, products that meet customer demands and the requirements of plumbing codes and/or regulatory agencies. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends. We may experience design, manufacturing, marketing or other difficulties, such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of experienced engineers, that could delay or prevent our development, introduction, approval or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses. Such difficulties could cause us to lose business from our customers and could adversely affect our competitive position; in addition, added expenses could decrease the profitability associated with those products that do not gain market acceptance. 17 Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability. Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and disposal and workplace safety. Such laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations and require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured. We could also be liable for the costs of property damage or personal injury to others. Although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws, we may not succeed in this effort at all times. The costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial. Under certain environmental laws, the current and past owners or operators of real property may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if they did not know of or were not responsible for such contamination. These laws also impose liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste at any site. Therefore, our ownership and operation of real property and our disposal of waste could lead to liabilities under these laws. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs relating to these environmental matters. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur additional costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be significant. Environmental litigation, enforcement and compliance are inherently uncertain and we may experience significant costs in connection with environmental matters. For more information, see Part I, Item 1, BusinessProduct Liability, Environmental, and Other Litigation Matters. Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may expend resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We may be required to spend resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. We have been limited from selling products from time-to-time because of existing patents. We face risks from product liability and other lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business. We have been and may continue to be subject to various product liability claims or other lawsuits, including, among others, that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation, or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products. In the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, damages from these claims would have to be paid from our assets and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We, like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and gases, face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and other lawsuits in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury, property damage or business interruption to our customers. Although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures, including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products, we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect. In addition, in certain cases, we rely on third-party manufacturers for our products or components of our products. Although we have product liability and general insurance coverage, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a 18 reasonable cost, or, if available, will be adequate to cover any such liabilities. For more information, see Part I, Item 1, BusinessProduct Liability, Environmental, and Other Litigation Matters. The requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142) may result in a write-off of all or a portion of our goodwill, which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. As of December 31, 2005, we recorded goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets of $296.6 million and $40.6 million, respectively. If we are required to take an impairment charge to our goodwill or intangible assets in connection with the requirements of FAS 142, our operating results may decrease and our financial condition may be harmed. Under FAS 142, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an annual impairment review of both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets. We have concluded that no impairment existed at October 30, 2005, the time of our latest annual review. We perform our annual test for indications of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. The loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our largest customer, The Home Depot, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, accounted for approximately $98.5 million, or 10.7%, of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $84.5 million, or 10.3%, of our total net sales for year ended December 31, 2004. Our customers generally are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and are able to terminate their relationships with us at any time. In addition, increases in the prices of our products could result in a reduction in orders for our products from the Home Depot, Inc and other customers. A significant reduction in orders from, or change in terms of contracts with, The Home Depot, Inc. or other significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Certain indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments. Our revolving credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain operational and financial covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders, incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios. If we do not maintain compliance with these covenants, our creditors could declare a default under our revolving credit facility and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. Our ability to comply with the provisions of our indebtedness may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control. One of our stockholders can exercise substantial influence over our company. As of February 1, 2006, Timothy P. Horne, a member of our board of directors, beneficially owned approximately 22.6% of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (assuming conversion of all shares of Class B Common Stock beneficially owned by Mr. Horne into Class A Common Stock) and approximately 99.0% of our outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, which represents approximately 73.8% of the total outstanding voting power. As long as Mr. Horne controls shares representing at least a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding stock, Mr. Horne will be able to unilaterally determine the outcome of all stockholder votes and other stockholders will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote. 19 Conversion and sale of a significant number of shares of our Class B Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. As of February 1, 2006, there were outstanding 25,205,210 shares of our Class A Common Stock and 7,343,880 shares of our Class B Common Stock. Shares of our Class B Common Stock may be converted into Class A Common Stock at any time on a one for one basis. All of the shares of Class A Common Stock are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws, except for any shares held by our affiliates, sales of which will be limited by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, under the terms of a registration rights agreement with respect to outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock, the holders of our Class B Common Stock have rights with respect to the registration of the underlying Class A Common Stock. Under these registration rights, the holders of Class B Common Stock may require, on up to two occasions, that we register their shares for public resale. If we are eligible to use Form S-3 or a similar short-form registration statement, the holders of Class B Common Stock may require that we register their shares for public resale up to two times per year. If we elect to register any shares of Class A Common Stock for any public offering, the holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to include shares of Class A Common Stock into which such shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted in such registration. However, we may reduce the number of shares proposed to be registered in view of market conditions. We will pay all expenses in connection with any registration, other than underwriting discounts and commissions. If all of the available registered shares are sold into the public market the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline. Our Class A Common Stock has insignificant voting power. Our Class B Common Stock entitles its holders to ten votes for each share and our Class A Common Stock entitles its holders to one vote per share. As of February 1, 2006, our Class B Common Stock constituted 22.6% of our total outstanding common stock and 74.5% of the total outstanding voting power and thus is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business.
