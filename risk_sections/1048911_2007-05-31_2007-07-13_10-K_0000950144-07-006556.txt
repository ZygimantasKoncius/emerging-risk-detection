BUSINESS Overview FedEx Corporation (FedEx) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies that compete collectively, operate independently and manage collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four reportable business segments:  FedEx Express: Federal Express Corporation (FedEx Express) is the worlds largest express transportation company, offering time-certain delivery within one to three business days and serving markets that comprise more than 90% of the worlds gross domestic product. The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade Networks, Inc., which provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global cargo distribution.  FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (FedEx Ground) is a leading provider of small-package ground delivery service. FedEx Ground provides low-cost service to every business address in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, as well as residential delivery to nearly 100% of U.S. residences through FedEx Home Delivery. The FedEx Ground segment also includes FedEx SmartPost, Inc., which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages using the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery to residences.  FedEx Freight: FedEx Freight Corporation is a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services through its FedEx Freight business (regional next-day and second-day and interregional LTL freight services) and its FedEx National LTL business (long-haul LTL freight services). The FedEx Freight segment also includes FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., North Americas largest time-specific, critical shipment carrier, and Caribbean Transportation Services, Inc., a leading provider of airfreight forwarding services between the United States and Puerto Rico.  FedEx Kinkos: FedEx Kinkos Office and Print Services, Inc. (FedEx Kinkos) is a leading provider of document solutions and business services. FedEx Kinkos global network of digitally-connected locations offers access to technology for copying and printing, professional finishing, document creation, Internet access, computer rentals, videoconferencing, signs and graphics, direct mail, Web-based printing and the full range of FedEx day-definite ground shipping and time-definite global express shipping services, and a variety of other retail services and products, including office supplies. For financial information concerning our reportable business segments, refer to the accompanying financial section, which includes managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and our consolidated financial statements. Our Web site is located at fedex.com. Detailed information about our services and our e-commerce tools and solutions can be found on our Web site. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our Web site, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. These and other SEC filings are available through the Investor Relations page of our Web site, the address of which is http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations. The information on our Web site, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year indicates our fiscal year ended May 31 of the year referenced. Strategy FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of FedEx Express and each of our other operating companies. Through our holding company and FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (FedEx Services), we provide strategic direction to, and coordination of, the FedEx portfolio 3 Table of Contents of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated business solutions. We are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the FedEx customer experience. For instance, we are expanding our transportation and retail networks (as described below) to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience. In addition, we are broadening and more effectively bundling our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers, such as through our recent acquisitions in the long-haul LTL freight and international domestic express transportation markets (as described below) and our new and improved service offerings  for example, FedEx Kinkos Print Online (see FedEx Kinkos Segment below). We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units. For example, our Web site, fedex.com, provides a single point of contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipment tracking, customer service and invoicing information and FedEx Kinkos office and print services. Similarly, by making one call to the new FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the best service meeting their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their pickup and delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped. We manage our business as a portfolio  in the long-term best interest of FedEx as a whole, not a particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our earnings performance and cash flow. As an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively, most of our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of FedEx as a whole. While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit. Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise. Each companys operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment. Our compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate. For example:  To accommodate international growth at FedEx Express, we are adding flights, purchasing aircraft, increasing capacity and improving services to and from Europe and Asia based on the growth prospects of these regions.  We are expanding network capacity at our growing FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight companies. For instance, we expect to increase FedEx Grounds daily package pick-up capacity to approximately five million packages by 2012.  We are expanding the FedEx Kinkos retail network, which will further increase customer access to FedEx shipping services and offer growth opportunities in e-commerce and other business services. We believe the following four trends continue to drive world commerce and shape the global marketplace:  Globalization: As the worlds economy becomes more fully integrated, and as barriers to trade continue to decrease, companies are sourcing and selling globally. With customers in more than 220 countries and 4 Table of Contents territories, we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach, delivery services and information capabilities.  Supply Chain Acceleration: As the economy has become increasingly global, it has also become more fast-paced, and companies of all sizes now depend on the delivery of just-in-time inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the move toward faster, more efficient supply chains by helping customers obtain near real-time information to manage inventory in motion, thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding time-to-market.  Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added Businesses: High-tech and high-value-added goods continue to increase as a percentage of total economic output. Our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and high-value-added industries.  Growth of E-Commerce: E-commerce acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a vital growth engine for businesses today. Through our global transportation and technology networks, we contribute to and benefit from the growth of e-commerce. These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access  to goods, services and information. This access is fueling a remarkable transformation of the worlds economy, helping businesses and nations flourish, and empowering individuals with greater choices and opportunities. Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward even stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability by:  Optimizing and expanding our worldwide FedEx Express network, particularly in key markets such as China and India.  Increasing the capacity, speed and reliability of our FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight networks and expanding the FedEx Kinkos retail network.  Emphasizing the compete collectively part of our core strategy through service improvements and focusing our employees and contractors on delivering the best customer experience in the industry, resulting in better alignment across the entire FedEx network. During 2007, we made several strategic acquisitions, each of which is expected to provide important contributions to our long-term growth, productivity and profitability.  In September 2006, we acquired the U.S. and Canadian LTL freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines, a leading provider of long-haul LTL freight services, and certain affiliates for $787 million in cash. ¡ Watkins U.S. long-haul LTL freight business, which has been renamed FedEx National LTL, operates within the FedEx Freight segment. The addition of Watkins three-day or more long-haul service to FedEx Freights industry-leading next-day and second-day regional LTL freight service meaningfully extends our leadership position in the heavyweight freight market. ¡ Watkins Canadian business, formerly known as Watkins Canada Express, has been renamed FedEx Freight Canada and will extend our reach and create opportunities for growth in the Canadian LTL market.  In December 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of ANC Holdings Ltd. (ANC), a United Kingdom domestic express transportation company, for $241 million, predominantly in cash. The acquisition of ANC, included in the FedEx Express segment, allows us to better serve the United Kingdom domestic market, which we previously served primarily through independent agents.  In January 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Prakash Air Freight Pvt. Ltd. (PAFEX), our primary service provider in India, for $32 million in cash. The acquisition of PAFEX, included in the FedEx Express segment, extends our operations in the global express industry with a wholly owned company in one of the worlds fastest growing markets.  In March 2007, we acquired Tianjin Datian W. Group Co., Ltd.s (DTW Group) fifty percent share of the FedEx-DTW International Priority express joint venture and assets relating to DTW Groups domestic 5 Table of Contents express network in China for $427 million in cash. The acquisition converted our joint venture with DTW Group, formed in 1999, into a wholly owned subsidiary of FedEx Express and increases our presence in China in the international and domestic express businesses. In sum, our overall long-term goal is to continue to:  deliver superior financial returns for our stockholders;  expand our portfolio of services to meet our customers needs; and  execute our compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively strategy with both discipline and imagination. Reputation and Responsibility By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the worlds most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2007:  FedEx ranked sixth in FORTUNE magazines Americas Most Admired Companies list and seventh in its Worlds Most Admired Companies list  the sixth consecutive year we have been ranked in the top ten on both lists.  For the fourth consecutive year, FedEx ranked in the top 15 in corporate reputation in The Wall Street Journals Harris Interactive/Reputation Institute RQ Survey.  FedEx continued to rank highest in customer satisfaction in the University of Michigan Business School National Quality Research Centers American Customer Satisfaction Index in the express delivery category.  FedEx ranked in the top 25 of InformationWeek magazines InformationWeek 500 list of the most innovative users of information technology. FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation, but also in social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance. Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. It is our people  our greatest asset  that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 280,000 employees and contractors who are absolutely, positively focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare. Community We are committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work, all around the world. As an example, we routinely donate our transportation capabilities and services to deliver aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes. We support and promote diversity and ethnic outreach by, among other things, making contributions to various non-profit organizations that serve the African-American and Hispanic communities, such as the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), INROADS, the Trumpet Awards and the Little Rock Nine Foundation. In addition to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism, we develop strategic relationships with certain charitable organizations that share our values, including:  United Way of America: We believe the United Way is one of the most effective and efficient ways of meeting community needs. FedEx supports a yearly fundraising campaign company-wide, and during our annual FedEx Cares week, FedEx employee volunteers donate thousands of hours to support United Way community efforts. 6 Table of Contents  American Red Cross: FedEx works with the Red Cross to provide a quick response to disasters around the world. FedEx uses its logistics and transportation expertise to provide complimentary shipping of emergency supplies and assists with financial support.  Safe Kids Worldwide: Reflecting the fact that safety is one of our top priorities, FedEx is the sole corporate sponsor of Safe Kids Walk This Way, a global program that advocates child pedestrian safety and teaches children, parents and communities how to prevent pedestrian accidents.  ORBIS International: FedEx helps ORBIS International provide eye care and treatment to people in developing countries. FedEx provides free aircraft maintenance and our pilots volunteer their time for ORBISs Flying Eye Hospital  a converted DC-10 aircraft equipped with surgical and training facilities.  Salvation Army: FedEx recently donated five mobile canteen vehicles to the Salvation Army disaster response units. FedEx also supports the Salvation Armys training of emergency response personnel worldwide through an initiative called Prepare to Respond to Emergencies  Planning and Readiness Education (PREPARE).  National Civil Rights Museum: FedEx serves as a major corporate sponsor of the National Civil Rights Museum, which educates the public on the lessons of the civil rights movement in the United States and its impact and influence on the human rights movement worldwide.  March of Dimes: FedEx is a national sponsor of March of Dimes WalkAmerica, and thousands of FedEx employees participate in it and other events that raise funds to help improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality.  Heart to Heart International: FedEx helps Heart to Heart International deliver food, medicine and emergency supplies to areas in need throughout the world. Environment We are committed to protecting the environment. FedEx evaluates the environmental impacts of FedEx packaging and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution prevention. FedEx Kinkos history also includes a longstanding dedication to protecting the environment, such as through the use of copy paper with a high recycled content. FedEx is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean, alternative and renewable energy sources. For example, the FedEx Express OptiFleet E700 hybrid electric vehicle decreases particulate emissions by over 90 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by over 25 percent and increases fuel economy by over 40 percent. FedEx Express operates 93 hybrid vehicles in North America, with more than 1 million miles in revenue service. In August 2005, we opened Californias then largest corporate solar electric rooftop system atop the FedEx Express regional hub in Oakland. To date, this solar electric system has provided approximately 2 billion watt hours of renewable energy generated by sunlight. We are also modernizing our aircraft fleet. For example, we are retiring and replacing older Boeing 727s with more fuel-efficient and quieter Boeing 757s. The use of newer and more fuel efficient aircraft will have the effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increasing our jet fuel efficiency. Governance FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance. Reflecting this commitment, we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance listing standards. We have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements. For example, in March 2007, our Board of Directors adopted a majority-voting standard in uncontested director elections and a resignation requirement for directors who fail to receive the required majority vote. The Board is prohibited from changing back to a plurality-voting standard without the approval of our stockholders. 7 Table of Contents In addition, we have made compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 one of our highest priorities, and we have leveraged this expensive and time-consuming effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting. Our goal has been not only to comply with the law, but also to build upon a process that will further enhance a strong controls mindset across FedEx today and in the future. Our Board of Directors reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, at least annually in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site at http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations. We will post in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is required. The information on our Web site, however, does not form part of this Report. Business Segments The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our business segments, as well as FedEx Services: FedEx Express Segment FedEx Express Overview FedEx Express invented express distribution in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories. FedEx Express offers time-certain delivery within one to three business days, serving markets that generate more than 90% of the worlds gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, with a money-back guarantee. FedEx Expresss unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the worlds largest express transportation company. FedEx Express employs more than 143,000 employees and has approximately 53,500 drop-off locations (including at FedEx Kinkos centers), 669 aircraft and 53,000 vehicles and trailers in its integrated global network. Services FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Overnight package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to virtually the entire United States population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available for urgent shipments up to 70 pounds to virtually any U.S. destination. FedEx Express also offers express freight services backed by money-back guarantees to handle the needs of the time-definite global freight market. International express delivery with a money-back guarantee is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx Express also offers a comprehensive international freight service, backed by a money-back guarantee, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance. During 2007, FedEx Express significantly increased the reach of its FedEx International Priority Freight service to cover more than 130 countries. For information regarding FedEx Express e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology. International Expansion FedEx Express is focused on further expanding its international presence, especially in key markets such as China and India. China and India are the two fastest growing major economies in the world, consistently 8 Table of Contents recording gross domestic product growth rates of over 7% a year. China is already the third largest trading country in the world, behind the United States and Germany, with total foreign trade exceeding $1.7 trillion in calendar 2006. We began serving China in 1984, and since that time, we have expanded our service to cover more than 200 cities and counties across the country  with plans to add 100 additional cities and counties over the next few years. We now employ approximately 6,000 workers in China. We have recently taken several important actions that increase our presence in China and India and bolster our leadership in the global air cargo industry. For example, during 2007, we completed the DTW Group and PAFEX acquisitions (see Strategy) and initiated a next-business-day, time-definite domestic express delivery service in China, which is available to more than 30 cities and counties throughout the country. The new China domestic express service is supported by a money-back guarantee and real-time package status tracking. Our China domestic express network relies on a hub-and-spoke system centered at the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, located in East Chinas Zhejiang Province. Other recent actions in China and India include:  In 2005, we launched the express air cargo industrys first direct flight from mainland China to Europe (a daily direct flight from Shanghai to Frankfurt, Germany) as part of a new westbound around-the-world route that originates and terminates in Memphis and provides connections via the FedEx AsiaOne network to and from northern and eastern China.  In 2006, we launched the first overnight express link between India and China as part of our new eastbound around-the-world route, which connects Europe, India, China and Japan with the FedEx Express U.S. hub in Memphis.  In 2006, we expanded our service in India. We increased our flight frequencies in and out of India and improved connectivity between key export centers and regional hubs, resulting in improved service, especially for customers in Delhi and northern India.  In 2006, we broke ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Southern China. The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current activities of our existing hub in Subic Bay, Philippines, beginning in 2009. We believe the new hub will better serve our global customers doing business in and with the fast-growing China and Asia-Pacific markets.  In 2007, we began using four new flight frequencies into China. We now have authority to operate a total of 30 weekly flights into China, the most of any U.S.-based cargo carrier. In support of our international expansion, we have agreed to purchase 15 Boeing 777 Freighter (B777F) aircraft, a new high-capacity, long-range airplane, with deliveries beginning in calendar 2009. We also hold an option to purchase an additional 15 B777F aircraft. To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer strong international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements. U.S. Postal Service Agreement Under a July 2006 agreement with the U.S. Postal Service that runs through September 2013, FedEx Express provides domestic air transportation services to the U.S. Postal Service, including for its First-Class, Priority and Express Mail. FedEx Express also has approximately 5,000 drop boxes at U.S. Post Offices in approximately 340 metropolitan areas and provides transportation and delivery for the U.S. Postal Services international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed (GXG). Pricing FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its services. In general, during 2007, U.S. shipping rates were based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Kinkos or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. International rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size, weight, destination and, 9 Table of Contents whenever applicable, whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Kinkos or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. FedEx Express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced. FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on the spot price for jet fuel. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2007 was based on the spot price for jet fuel published for April 2007. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. Operations FedEx Expresss primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the companys multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility, which we are significantly expanding, is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, and Fort Worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago. FedEx Express is building a new regional hub in Greensboro, North Carolina, which is scheduled to begin operations in calendar 2009. Facilities in Anchorage, Paris and Subic Bay, Philippines, serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Subic Bay and Paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami  the Miami Gateway Hub  serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets. In 2006, we broke ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Southern China. The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current activities of our existing hub in Subic Bay, Philippines, beginning in 2009. Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the stations service area. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption FedEx Express Segment. In some international areas, independent agents (Global Service Participants) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. FedEx Kinkos offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. locations and is adding FedEx Express shipping services at its international locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, corporate or industrial parks and outside U.S. Post Offices. Fuel Supplies and Costs During 2007, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See FedEx Express  Pricing. 10 Table of Contents The following table sets forth FedEx Expresss costs for jet fuel and its percentage of total revenues for the last five fiscal years: Percentage Total Cost of Total Fiscal Year (in millions) Revenues 2007 $ 2,639 7.5 % 2006 2,497 7.7 2005 1,780 6.1 2004 1,160 4.7 2003 1,058 4.7 Approximately 10% of FedEx Expresss requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk. The remainder of FedEx Expresss requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts. Competition The express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency and capacity of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings. Competitors in these markets include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), DHL, passenger airlines offering express package services, regional express delivery concerns, airfreight forwarders and the U.S. Postal Service. FedEx Expresss principal competitors in the international market are DHL, UPS, foreign postal authorities such as Deutsche Post and TNT N.V., freight forwarders, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Expresss competitors in the international market are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express. Employees David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2007, FedEx Express employed approximately 93,000 permanent full-time and 50,000 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 16% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Expresss international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 25% of all employees. FedEx Express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent. The pilots of FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and are employed under a four-year collective bargaining agreement that took effect on October 30, 2006. Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees. FedEx Trade Networks FedEx Trade Networks is a leading provider of international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global cargo distribution. Its value-added services include Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks publishes customs duty and tax information for over 100 customs areas worldwide. FedEx Trade Networks has approximately 3,500 employees and 100 offices in 70 service locations throughout North America. Offices are also maintained in major Asian and European markets through dedicated agents. 11 Table of Contents FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Ground Overview By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back-guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing primarily on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the United States population and overnight service up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the United States population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Puerto Rico, Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. In addition, to meet growing customer demand for its services, FedEx Ground is in the midst of a major network capacity expansion program, which is expected to increase its daily pick-up capacity to approximately five million packages by 2012. The multi-phase plan includes the addition of nine new hubs, the expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities. Each of the new hubs will feature the latest automated sorting technology. In addition to the continuing success of FedEx Grounds business-to-business service, the increasing popularity of FedEx Home Delivery, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences, has driven growth in the companys package volumes and financial results. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated exclusively to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and also offers a money-back guarantee. FedEx SmartPost (a subsidiary of FedEx Ground) is a leading national small-parcel consolidator, which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery to residences. The company picks up shipments from customers (including e-tailers and catalog companies), provides sorting and linehaul services and then delivers the packages to a U.S. Postal Service facility for final delivery by a postal carrier. Through its network of 20 distribution hubs and approximately 1,680 employees, FedEx SmartPost provides delivery Monday through Saturday to all residential addresses in the U.S., including P.O. Boxes and military destinations. Pricing FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, during 2007, U.S. shipping rates were based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Ground contractor or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Kinkos or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter. FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which applies to all shipments. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2007 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for April 2007. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. 12 Table of Contents Operations FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of approximately 500 facilities, including 29 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with approximately 20,600 owner-operated vehicles and 25,800 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Deliverys operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies. Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of over 3.1 million packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided charge-coupled device (CCD) scan technologies, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx Web site, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology. FedEx Kinkos offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S. As of May 31, 2007, FedEx Ground had approximately 44,000 employees and 13,800 independent contractors. Although FedEx Ground believes its relationship with its employees and independent contractors is excellent, the company is involved in numerous purported class-action lawsuits and other proceedings that claim that the companys owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors) and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. David F. Rebholz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS, DHL and the U.S. Postal Service. FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight Corporation FedEx Freight Corporation provides a full range of LTL freight services through its FedEx Freight business (regional next-day and second-day and interregional LTL freight services), its FedEx National LTL business (long-haul LTL freight services) and its FedEx Freight Canada business, and is known for its exceptional service, reliability and on-time performance. Through a comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually all U.S. ZIP Codes (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freights regional and interregional LTL freight services are supported by a no-fee money-back guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia via alliances and purchased transportation. FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL have an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to weekly adjustment based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel. We are focused on expanding the FedEx Freight network  opening new service centers and increasing capacity at a number of key locations  to better meet customer demand. For example, in 2007, FedEx Freight opened seven new service centers and expanded eight others. In 2007, FedEx Freight Corporation also added a long-haul LTL freight business and Canadian operations by acquiring the U.S. and Canadian LTL freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines and certain affiliates, now known as FedEx National LTL and FedEx Freight Canada. See Strategy. FedEx Freight specializes in fast-cycle distribution and provides tailored shipping solutions to help shippers meet tight deadlines. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers time-critical 13 Table of Contents needs with reduced transit times, after-hours pickup or delivery, or same-day delivery. FedEx Freights fully integrated Web site and other e-tools, including a bill of lading generator and e-mail delivery notification, make freight shipping easier and bring customers closer to their own account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice service feature uses the companys innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the Internet or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. FedEx Freight Corporation has leveraged its relationships with other FedEx operating companies to meet the increasingly global needs of customers. For example, the FedEx Freight Corporation sales force sells FedEx Express freight services, and FedEx Services sales representatives share LTL leads with their counterparts at FedEx Freight Corporation. The sales effort is one phase of a broad initiative aimed at leveraging FedExs competitive advantage in U.S. domestic freight services.

Marketing The FedEx brand name is a symbol for high-quality service, reliability and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world.

FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Kinkos, FedEx Services, FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, FedEx Customer Information Services, FedEx National LTL, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file.

In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness. Regulation Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express. The FAAs regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards, maintenance and corrosion control, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations. 17 Table of Contents The DOTs authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOTs jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. FedEx Expresss international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOTs approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. In May 2006, the TSA adopted new rules enhancing many of the security requirements for air cargo on both passenger and all-cargo aircraft, and in May 2007, the TSA issued a revised model all-cargo aircraft security program for implementing the new rules. Together with other all-cargo aircraft operators, we have filed comments with the TSA requesting clarification regarding several provisions in the revised model program. Until the requirements for our security program under the new rules are finalized, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that these rules or other future security requirements for air cargo carriers could impose material costs on us. FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Expresss wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for charter flights. Ground. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration. The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx National LTL and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation. Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations. Communication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Expresss activities pertaining to satellite communications. Environmental. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Expresss aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. FedEx Expresss aircraft are also subject to, and are in compliance with, the regulations governing engine emissions. In addition to federal 18 Table of Contents regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Expresss aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Expresss significant markets. Congresss passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Expresss international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Kinkos copy machines and photo film developing operations. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations. Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We present information about our risk factors on pages 62 through 65 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
