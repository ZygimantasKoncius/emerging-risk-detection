ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Certain risks are identified below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” This information is incorporated here by reference. Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factors that affect them. Many of the primary markets for the products and services we sell are subject to cyclical fluctuations that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce. Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same economic factors that affect demand for and production of customers' goods and materials.When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand or tight credit conditions, their need for our products and services diminishes. Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses increase too. Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for distributors, as well as customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and financial results. In recent years, we have witnessed consolidation among our product suppliers and customers. As customer industries consolidate, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from higher volume contracts, which could adversely impact the amount and volatility of our earnings. Consolidation among customers can trigger changes in their purchasing strategies, potentially moving large blocks of business among competing industrial distributors and contributing to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices. Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in supplier distribution programs could adversely affect our sales and earnings. Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand. Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding, but are terminable by either party. The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial problems, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control.In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors generally, or Applied in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us. For example, key suppliers could change the following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing products; the geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support programs; or product purchase or stocking expectations.An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational distributors of industrial machinery parts, equipment, and supplies. Competition is largely focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price. Some existing competitors have, and potential market entrants may have, greater financial or other resources than we do, or broader product or service offerings. If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market share by reducing prices, we may need to lower our prices for products or services, thereby adversely affecting financial results.The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in response to declining customer demand. Certain of our product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors, including us, incentives for purchasing their products. In addition to market or customer account-specific incentives, certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining specific purchase volumes during the 6Table of Contentsprogram period. In some cases, in order to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier. When demand for our products declines, we may be less willing to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on our information systems. We face additional risks in this regard as we implement a new integrated information technology platform for our business. We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, provide superior service to customers, and accumulate financial results. A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems or breach in security could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings.We are completing the process of replacing multiple legacy applications with an SAP software platform, to enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth. The implementation has occurred over several years in planned phases, primarily based on geographic region; as of June 30, 2014, a substantial majority of our service center operations in the U.S. and Canada were using SAP. We have also begun the transformation of our financial and accounting systems including fixed assets, general ledger and consolidation systems. These implementations are expected to continue through fiscal 2015. Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions in our business operations related to the implementation because of the project's complexity. The potential material adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity, and unanticipated increases in costs. Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from the new platform is not assured.Volatility in product and energy costs can affect our profitability. Cost increases in commodity resources, such as steel and energy, can lead product manufacturers to increase the prices of products we distribute. In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is comprised of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities. Our ability to pass along to customers the increases in our product and distribution costs depends on market conditions. Raising our prices could result in decreased sales volume, which could significantly reduce our profitability. When costs fall, market prices can fall too, again potentially affecting profitability.Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth. We may not be able to identify or to complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their anticipated benefits. Many industries we serve are mature. As a result, acquisitions of other businesses have been important to our growth in recent years. While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain financing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete acquisitions. In addition, existing or future competitors may increasingly seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable opportunities.We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations. However, substantial costs, delays, or other difficulties related to integrating acquisitions into our operations could adversely affect our business or financial results. We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, information systems, personnel, and operations in a timely and efficient manner.Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, sales, profit levels, or other benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame we expect. Our ability to realize anticipated benefits may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory effectively, and to consolidate facilities; the incurrence of significant integration costs or charges in order to achieve those benefits; and our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer relationships, and employees. In addition, acquisitions could place significant demand on administrative, operational, and financial resources.Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of future financing. Although the credit market turmoil of several years ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased. If credit market volatility were to return, then obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current facilities. Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.7Table of ContentsFor more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” That information is incorporated here by reference.Our growth outside the United States increases our exposure to global economic and political conditions. Foreign operations contributed 17.4% of our sales in 2014. If we continue to grow outside the U.S., the risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, cultural and legal differences in conducting business, and currency fluctuations will increase.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualified sales and customer service personnel and other skilled managers and professionals. There are significant costs associated with recruiting, training, and developing skilled employees. With respect to sales and customer service positions, we greatly benefit from having employees who are familiar with the products we sell and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier relationships. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of, or increased competition for, available skilled workers, or by the loss of a significant number of our sales and customer service personnel or other managers or professionals, including through retirement as the workforce ages.An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers could adversely impact our business. Our business depends on maintaining operations at our headquarters and distribution centers. A serious, prolonged interruption due to power outage, telecommunications outage, terrorist attack, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, fire, flood, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from our business. These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters. In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a public company or government contractor, or otherwise relating to our compliance with a wide array of laws and regulations to which we are subject. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.In addition to the risks identified above, other risks to our future performance include, but are not limited to, the following:changes in customer preferences for products and services of the nature, brands, quality, or cost sold by Applied;changes in customer procurement policies and practices;changes in the market prices for products and services relative to the costs of providing them;changes in operating expenses;organizational changes within the company;adverse regulation and legislation, both enacted and under consideration, including with respect to federal tax policy (e.g., affecting the use of the LIFO inventory accounting method and the taxation of foreign-sourced income);the variability and timing of new business opportunities including acquisitions, alliances, customer relationships, and supplier authorizations;the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions;volatility of our stock price and the resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements; andchanges in accounting policies and practices that could impact our financial reporting and increase compliance costs.ITEM 1B.
