ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion of risk factors contains "forward-looking statements", as discussed in Item 7. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones relevant to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry Recent credit and financial market events and conditions, including disruptions in the U.S. and international credit markets and other financial systems and the deterioration of U.S. and global economic conditions, could, among other things, impede access to or increase the cost of financing, cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and not give technical or other waivers under our Credit Facilities (as defined below) to the extent we may seek them in the future, thereby causing us to be in default under one or more of the Credit Facilities, cause our commercial customers to incur liquidity issues that could lead to some of our services being cancelled and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In the second half of 2007, the U.S. residential mortgage market began to experience serious disruption due to credit quality deterioration and delinquencies in a significant portion of originated mortgages, particularly subprime and non-prime mortgages; foreclosure activity began to rise; the residential housing market began to experience a slowing pace of transactions, declining housing prices and increased cost and reduced availability of mortgages; delinquencies in non-mortgage consumer credit increased; consumer confidence began to decline; and credit markets became disrupted and illiquid. These conditions continued throughout 2007 and 2008 and into 2009, expanding into a deterioration of confidence in the broader U.S. and global credit and financial markets and resulting in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads, a lack of price transparency, increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions. Concerns about adverse developments in the credit and financial markets, unstable consumer sentiment, high unemployment and uncertainty about corporate earnings continue to challenge the U.S. and global financial and credit markets and overall economies. These unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. These disruptions could, among other things, lead to impairment charges, make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future, cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and not give technical or other waivers under our $2,650 million senior secured term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility") and $150 million pre-funded letter of credit facility (together with the Term Loan Facility, the "Term Facilities") or our $500 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") (the Term Facilities and Revolving Credit Facility are collectively referred to herein as the "Credit Facilities") to the extent we may seek them in the future, thereby causing us to be in default under one or more of the Credit Facilities. These disruptions also could cause our commercial customers to encounter liquidity issues that could lead to some of our services being cancelled or reduced. Although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to the Credit Facilities and are not aware of any issues currently impacting the ability of the lenders under them to honor their 10 Table of Contents commitments to extend credit, there is no assurance that the U.S. and global credit crisis will not adversely affect our ability to borrow on the Credit Facilities in the future. Liquidity or capital problems at one or more of the lenders on the Revolving Credit Facility could reduce or eliminate the amount available for us to draw under such facility. Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. There can be no assurance that these disruptions and turmoil will not get worse over time and thus impact us more than they have to date. These economic uncertainties make it very difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. The continuance of the current uncertain economic conditions or further deterioration of such conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Continued weakening in general economic conditions, especially as they may affect home sales, unemployment or consumer confidence or spending levels, may adversely affect our results of operations. A substantial portion of our results of operations are dependent upon spending by consumers and deterioration in general economic conditions, and consumer confidence could affect the demand for our services. Consumer spending levels have been declining due to recent global economic conditions and there can be no assurance that consumer spending will return to prior levels. A continuation or worsening of macroeconomic indicators, including home sales, home foreclosures, consumer confidence or unemployment rates, could further adversely affect consumer spending levels, reduce the demand for our services and impact our results of operations. These factors could also negatively impact the timing or the ultimate collection of accounts receivable, which would negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The failure of any banking institution in which we deposit our funds or any insurance company that provides insurance to us may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The deterioration in global economic conditions and the weakening of the financial markets have reduced the financial strength of some financial institutions and insurance companies. We maintain cash balances in excess of federally-insured limits at various depository institutions. If one or more of the depository institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and could materially impact our liquidity and potentially cause material financial losses. Similarly, if one or more insurance companies were to fail, we may encounter issues with our insurance coverage and payment of claims. We also may not be able to replace our insurance coverage with another insurer at all or on as favorable terms as our current insurance arrangements. Thus, the failure of a banking institution or insurance company with which we do business may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Weather conditions and seasonality affect the demand for our services and our results of operations. The demand for our services and our results of operations are affected by weather conditions and by the seasonal nature of our lawn care and landscape maintenance services, termite and pest control services, home inspection services and disaster restoration services. For example, in our geographies that do not have a year-round growing season, the demand for our lawn care and landscape maintenance services decreases during the winter months. Droughts, severe winter storms and snow fall, whether created by climate change factors or otherwise, can adversely impact the timing of product or service delivery and/or demand for lawn care and landscape maintenance services, and cooler temperatures can impede the development of the termite swarm and lead to lower demand for our termite services. Severe winter storms can also impact our home cleaning 11 Table of Contents business if we cannot travel to service locations due to hazardous road conditions. In addition, severe temperatures can lead to an increase in service requests related to household systems and appliances in our home service contract business, resulting in higher costs and lower profitability. Our market segments are highly competitive. Competition could reduce our market share and adversely impact our results of operations. We operate in highly competitive market segments. Changes in the source and intensity of competition in the market segments served by us impact the demand for our services and may result in additional pricing pressures. The relatively low capital cost of entry to certain of our businesses has led to strong competitive markets, including regional and local owner-operated companies. Regional and local competitors operating in a limited geographic area may have lower labor, benefits and overhead costs. The principal methods of competition in our businesses include name recognition, quality and speed of service, pricing, customer satisfaction and reputation. No assurance can be given that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and that the competitive pressures that we face will not result in reduced market segment share or negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Increases in raw material prices, fuel prices and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Our financial performance is affected by the level of our operating expenses, such as fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, raw materials, wages and salaries, employee benefits, health care, vehicle, self-insurance costs and other insurance premiums as well as various regulatory compliance costs, all of which may be subject to inflationary pressures. In particular, our financial performance is adversely affected by increases in these operating costs. In recent years, fuel prices have fluctuated widely. Sharp increases were experienced in 2007 and 2008, which raised our costs of operating vehicles and equipment. Fuel price increases can also result in increases in the cost of fertilizer, chemicals and other materials used in our business. We cannot predict the extent to which we may experience future increases in costs of fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, raw materials, wages, employee benefits, healthcare, vehicles, insurance and other operating costs. To the extent such costs increase, we may not be able to fully pass these increased costs through to our existing and prospective customers, and the rates we pay to our subcontractors may increase, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain trained workers and third party contractors. Our future success and financial performance depend substantially on our ability to attract, retain and train workers and attract and retain third party contractors. Our ability to conduct our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force including on a seasonal basis, which may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including a failure of the U.S. Congress to reauthorize the returning worker exception to the H2B Visa Program, which may negatively impact the number of foreign nationals available to engage in seasonal employment. In the event of a labor shortage, we could experience difficulty in delivering our services in a high-quality or timely manner and could be forced to increase wages in order to attract and retain employees, which would result in higher operating costs and reduced profitability. We may not successfully implement our business strategies or realize all of our expected cost savings. We may not be able to fully implement our business strategies or realize, in whole or in part within the time frames anticipated, the anticipated benefits of our various initiatives, such as our 12 Table of Contents Terminix Termite Inspection and Protection Plan and TruGreen Targeted Lawn Care program, or our expected cost savings and efficiency improvements, including those related to reorganization and restructuring programs. As an example, in 2009 TruGreen LawnCare initiated restructuring activities related to a reorganization of field leadership and a restructuring of branch operations, designed to result in a centralization of core field functions and certain administrative functions; however, we may not be able to achieve the increase in sales, cost savings, efficiencies and other anticipated benefits from this initiative. In addition, our various business strategies and initiatives, including our productivity and customer retention initiatives, are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. We expect to incur certain costs to achieve our expected cost savings and efficiency improvements. These costs may turn out to be substantially higher than we currently estimate, and we may not fully achieve our expected cost savings and efficiency improvements or these initiatives may adversely impact our customer retention and/or our operations. Our ability to successfully realize cost savings and the timing of any realization may be affected by factors such as the need to ensure continuity in our operations, contracts, regulations and/or statutes governing employee-employer relationships, our ability to renegotiate contracts or find alternative suppliers and other factors. Our business strategy may also change from time to time. As a result, we may not be able to achieve our expected results of operations. Public perceptions that our products and services are not environmentally friendly or safe may adversely affect the demand for our services. In providing our services, we use, among other things, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. Public perception that our products and services are not environmentally friendly or safe or are harmful to humans or animals, whether justified or not, could reduce demand for our services, increase regulation or government restrictions, impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand names and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in the types or mix of our service offerings could affect our financial performance. Our financial performance is affected by changes in the types or mix of services we offer our customers. For example, when Terminix transitioned from offering primarily bait termite services to providing both liquid and bait termite services, this transition required the purchase of additional equipment and training. The bait and termite service lines also have different price points (for both the initial treatment and for renewals), different ongoing service obligations and different revenue recognition policies. These changes in mix can also affect the timing of our revenues. An unsuccessful rollout or adjustment of our service offerings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Government laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could increase our legal and regulatory expenses and affect our financial performance. Our businesses are subject to significant federal, state and local laws and regulations. These federal, state and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection, wage and hour requirements, the employment of immigrants, labor relations, permit and licensing requirements, workers' safety, the environment, insurance and home service contracts, employee benefits, marketing (including telemarketing or green marketing) and advertising, the application of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and other chemicals, noise and air pollution from power equipment and water management techniques. In particular, we anticipate that various federal, state and local governing bodies may propose additional legislation and regulation that may be detrimental to our business or may substantially increase our operating costs, including legislation relating to the Employee Free Choice Act; environmental regulations related to water quality, water use, chemical use, climate change and other environmental matters; or "do-not-knock", "do-not-mail", 13 Table of Contents "do-not-leave" or other marketing regulations. It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses but changes to such requirements may affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, if we were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in litigation, suffer losses to our reputation or suffer the loss of licenses or penalties that may affect how our business is operated, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. Congress has focused extensively on health care reform legislation recently, and a comprehensive health care reform law was recently enacted. We cannot currently predict what new requirements we may be subject to as a result of this new health care reform law. However, new requirements to provide additional health insurance benefits to our employees would likely increase our expenses, and any such increases could be significant enough to materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The loss of the services of management personnel and other employees as a result of restructuring initiatives could adversely affect our financial performance. Our recent restructuring initiatives were designed to eliminate layers and bureaucracy and simplify work processes in order to better align the Company's work processes around its operational and strategic objectives. This restructuring has resulted in employee workforce reductions as part of the cost-savings to be achieved and should enhance our financial performance, however, the loss of management personnel and other employees could disrupt our business and impair our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our business process outsourcing initiatives have increased our reliance on third-party contractors and may expose our business to harm upon the termination or disruption of our third party contractor relationships. Our strategy to increase profitability, in part, by reducing our costs of operations includes the implementation of business process outsourcing initiatives. As a result, our future operations will increasingly rely on third party vendors to provide services that we previously performed internally. Any disruption, termination or substandard performance of these outsourced services, including possible breaches by third party vendors of their agreements with us, could adversely affect our brands, customer relationships, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Also, if a third party outsourcing provider relationship is terminated, there is a risk that we may not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider in a timely manner or on terms that we consider favorable, and even if we find an alternate provider, there are risks associated with any transitioning activities. In addition, in the event a third party outsourcing relationship is terminated and we are unable to replace it, there is a risk that we may no longer have the capabilities to perform these services internally. Laws and regulations regarding the use of pesticides and fertilizers, as well as other environmental laws and regulations, could result in significant costs that adversely affect our operating results. Local, state, federal and international laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters affect us in several ways. In the United States, products containing pesticides generally must be registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") (and similar state agencies) before they can be sold or applied. The failure to obtain or the cancellation of any such registration, or the other withdrawal from the market place of such pesticides, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on the products involved, whether other products could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. The pesticides we use are manufactured by independent third parties and are evaluated by the EPA 14 Table of Contents as part of its ongoing exposure risk assessment. The EPA may decide that a pesticide we use will be limited or will not be re-registered for use in the United States. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the EPA's continuing evaluations. In addition, the use of certain pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and international environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may require that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations, may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may restrict or ban the use of certain products. Although we strive to comply with such regulations and have processes in place designed to achieve compliance, given our dispersed locations, distributed operations and numerous employees, we can give no assurance that we may not violate these and other regulations or changes thereto. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations and licenses, we cannot assure you that the products we apply or the manner in which we apply them, particularly pesticide products, will not be alleged to cause injury to the environment or to people under any circumstances or will not be banned in certain circumstances. The costs of compliance, remediation or products liability lawsuits could materially affect our future operating results. Local, state, federal and foreign agencies regulate the disposal, handling and storage of waste, air and water discharges from our facilities and the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, these laws and regulations. If there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances surrounding the assumptions upon which we operate or if we are found not to be in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations, it could have a material impact on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses and our results of financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Local, state, federal and foreign agencies that regulate environmental matters may change environmental laws, regulations or standards, including imposing new regulations with respect to climate change matters. Changes in any of these or other laws, regulations or standards could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business. Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names, ServiceMaster, Terminix, TruGreen, TruGreen LandCare, Merry Maids, ServiceMaster Clean, American Home Shield, AmeriSpec and Furniture Medic. We have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks either in the United States or in every country in which they are used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful claim of trademark, patent or 15 Table of Contents other intellectual property infringement against us, or any other successful challenge to the use of our intellectual property, could subject us to damages or prevent us from providing certain services under our recognized brand names, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Disruptions or security failures in our information technology systems could create liability for us and/or limit our ability to effectively monitor, operate and control our operations and adversely affect our operating results. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor, operate and control our operations. Any disruption in or failure of our information technology systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows by limiting, among other things, our capacity to monitor, operate and control our operations effectively. If our disaster recovery plans do not work as anticipated, or if the third party vendor to which we have outsourced certain information technology services fails to fulfill its obligations to us, our operations may be adversely impacted. In addition, because our systems contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities relating to violations of privacy laws or otherwise, which may lead to lower revenues, increased costs and other material adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information, such as payment card and personal information. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. Improper activities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our systems. Any compromises, breaches or errors in application could cause interruptions in our operations, damage to our reputation and customers' willingness to purchase our services, result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements and subject us to costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to various restrictive covenants that could adversely impact our operations. From time to time, we enter into noncompetition agreements that restrict us from entering into lines of business or operating in certain areas into which we may desire to expand our business. We also are subject to various non-solicitation and no hire covenants that may restrict our ability to solicit potential customers or employees. To the extent that such restrictive covenants prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities, or we fail to comply with them, our operations may be adversely impacted. 16 Table of Contents Future acquisitions could affect our financial performance. We plan to continue to pursue opportunities to expand through selective acquisitions. Our ability to make acquisitions at reasonable prices and to integrate acquired businesses is an important factor in our future growth. We cannot ensure that we will be able to manage or integrate acquired businesses successfully and/or retain customers of the acquired businesses. Any inability on our part to consolidate and manage growth from acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and there can be no assurance that any acquisition that we make in the future will provide us with the benefits that were anticipated when entering into such acquisition. The process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses, including the diversion of resources needed to integrate new businesses, technologies, products, personnel or systems; the inability to retain employees, customers and suppliers; the assumption of actual or contingent liabilities; failure to follow internal processes; write-offs or impairment charges relating to goodwill and other intangible assets; unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to acquired businesses; and potential expense associated with litigation with sellers of such businesses. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. We have significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to intangible assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as: significant adverse changes in the business climate; adverse actions or assessments by regulators; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; and a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (e.g., a likelihood that is more than 50%) a reporting unit or intangible asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of. Based upon future economic conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred. Our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business. Our franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them. Each franchising brand also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses. As a result, the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and a brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, it is possible that creditors, or other claimants of a franchisee, could, in the event such creditors and claimants cannot collect from our franchisee or otherwise, attempt to make claims against the Company under various legal theories. If successful, these claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows. 17 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Our Debt We are indirectly owned and controlled by the Equity Sponsors, and their interests as equity holders may conflict with the interests of holders of our debt. We are indirectly owned and controlled by the Equity Sponsors, who have the ability to control our policies and operations. The directors appointed by affiliates of the Equity Sponsors are able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue or repurchase capital stock, pay dividends and incur or repurchase debt. The interests of the Equity Sponsors may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of the holders of our debt. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of our Equity Sponsors might conflict with the interests of holders of our debt. In addition, our Equity Sponsors may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transaction might involve risks to our business or the holders of our debt. Furthermore, the Equity Sponsors may in the future own businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us. One or more of the Equity Sponsors also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. We have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and satisfy our obligations. As of December 31, 2009, we had $3,974.9 million of consolidated indebtedness and $500.0 million of available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our substantial debt could have important consequences to holders of our debt and other stakeholders in the Company. Because of our substantial debt: our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing could become impaired; our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt may be impaired in the future; a large portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings, including under the Credit Facilities, and certain floating rate operating leases are at variable rates of interest; it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such debt; we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt on more favorable terms and, as a result, they may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; our ability to refinance debt may be limited or the associated costs may increase; and our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending that 18 Table of Contents is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our businesses. Despite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures governing our debt securities do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. The Credit Facilities provide us with commitments for additional borrowings of up to $500.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2009, and permit additional borrowings beyond those commitments under certain circumstances. In addition, we have the option to pay interest on portions of our debt by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding loans ("PIK Interest"), which would increase our debt by the amount of any such PIK Interest. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. The Credit Facilities contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional debt (including guarantees of other debt); pay dividends or make other restricted payments, including investments; prepay or amend the terms of our other debt; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; sell certain assets, or, in the case of any borrower under the Credit Facilities, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; create liens; in the case of the Term Loan Facility, enter into agreements restricting dividends or other distributions by subsidiaries to ServiceMaster; and in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, make acquisitions, enter into agreements restricting our ability to incur liens securing the Revolving Credit Facility and change our business or ServiceMaster's fiscal year. The indenture governing our 10.75%/11.50% senior toggle notes maturing in 2015 (the "Permanent Notes") also contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: incur more debt; repurchase our debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and 19 Table of Contents enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. The restrictions in the indenture governing the Permanent Notes, the Credit Facilities and the instruments governing our other debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, at maturity or otherwise, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Permanent Notes and the instruments governing our other debt may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control including credit or capital market disruptions. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default that would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations, such as the lenders under the Credit Facilities, could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under the Credit Facilities and may not be able to repay the amounts due under the Credit Facilities and the Permanent Notes. This could have serious consequences to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. Our ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on our debt and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our debt or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control. As a holding company, we have no independent operations or material assets other than our ownership of equity interests in our subsidiaries, and we will depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so that we may pay our obligations and expenses, including satisfying our obligations under our debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our debt will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us, which, in turn, will depend on their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, general business conditions and any legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to which they may be subject, many of which may be beyond our control, and as described under "Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry" above. The payment of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by our subsidiaries that are regulated as insurance, home service, or similar companies is subject to applicable state law limitations. If we cannot receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to meet our obligations to fund general corporate expenses or service our debt obligations. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital, elect to pay PIK Interest or restructure our debt. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on July 24, 2013 and the Term Loan Facilities will mature on July 24, 2014. The Permanent Notes will mature on July 15, 2015. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt. It is our understanding that a significant amount of global indebtedness related to the leveraged buy-out boom will mature between 2012 and 2015, when significant 20 Table of Contents portions of our debt is scheduled to mature. There is no assurance that the debt markets will be able to absorb all of the potential refinancing during that time period. Moreover, in 2008 and 2009, the global credit markets suffered a significant contraction, including the failure of some large financial institutions. This resulted in a significant decline in the credit markets and the overall availability of credit. Market disruptions, such as those experienced in 2008 and 2009, as well as our significant debt levels, may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to refinance our obligations as they become due. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or access additional credit, or if short-term or long-term borrowing costs dramatically increase, our ability to finance current operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations could be adversely affected. If we cannot refinance our debt, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We cannot assure you we will be able to consummate those sales, or if we do, what the timing of the sales will be, whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet debt service obligations when due or whether we would receive fair value for such assets. Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability. A significant portion of our outstanding debt, including debt under the Credit Facilities, bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in approximately an $11.5 million change in the annual interest expense on our Term Loan Facilities after considering the impact of the interest rate swaps into which we have entered. Assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in approximately a $5.0 million change in annual interest expense on our Revolving Credit Facility. We are also exposed to increases in interest rates with respect to our arrangement enabling us to transfer an interest in certain receivables to unrelated third parties. Assuming all available amounts were transferred under this arrangement, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in approximately a $0.5 million change in annual interest expense with respect to this arrangement. We are also exposed to increases in interest rates with respect to our floating rate operating leases, and a one percentage point change in interest rates would result in approximately a $1.4 million change in annual rent expense with respect to such operating leases. The impact of increases in interest rates could be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our substantial debt and floating rate operating leases. ITEM 1B.
