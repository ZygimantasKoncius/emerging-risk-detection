BUSINESS CNB FINANCIAL CORPORATION CNB Financial Corporation (the Corporation) is a Financial Holding Company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. It was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 for the purpose of engaging in the business of a Financial Holding Company. On April 26, 1984, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of County National Bank, a national banking chartered institution. In December of 2006, County National Bank changed its name to CNB Bank (the Bank) and became a state bank chartered in Pennsylvania and subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Corporation is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In general, the Corporation is limited to owning or controlling banks and engaging in such other activities as are properly incident thereto. The Corporation is currently engaged in four non-banking activities through its wholly owned subsidiaries CNB Securities Corporation, County Reinsurance Company, CNB Insurance Agency, and Holiday Financial Services Corporation. CNB Securities Corporation was formed in 2005 to hold and manage investments that were previously owned by the Bank and the Corporation and to provide the Corporation with additional latitude to purchase other investments. County Reinsurance Company was formed in June of 2001 as a corporation in the state of Arizona. The company provides accidental death and disability and life insurance as a part of lending relationships of the Bank. CNB Insurance Agency was established in February of 2003. The company provides fixed annuity products to banking customers. The Corporations newest subsidiary, Holiday Financial Services Corporation, was formed in 2005 to facilitate the Corporations entry into the consumer discount loan and finance business. Finally, in addition to these operating subsidiaries, the Corporation has two wholly owned affiliates, CNB Capital Trust II and CNB Capital Trust III, which are accounted for using the equity method. These entities were formed in 2007 for the sole purpose of issuing and selling certain securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trusts and investing the proceeds thereof in subordinated debentures. The Corporation does not currently engage in any operating business activities, other than the ownership and management of CNB Bank, CNB Securities Corporation, County Reinsurance Company, CNB Insurance Agency, and Holiday Financial Services Corporation. CNB BANK The Bank was incorporated in 1934 and is chartered in the State of Pennsylvania. The Banks Main Office is located at 1 South Second Street, Clearfield, (Clearfield County) Pennsylvania. The primary marketing area consists of the Pennsylvania Counties of Clearfield, Elk (excluding the Townships of Millstone, Highland and Spring Creek), McKean, Cambria and Cameron. It also includes a portion of western Centre County including Philipsburg Borough, Rush Township and the western portions of Snow Shoe and Burnside Townships and a portion of Jefferson County, consisting of the boroughs of Brockway, Falls Creek, Punxsutawney, Reynoldsville and Sykesville, and the townships of Washington, Winslow and Henderson. ERIEBANK, a division of CNB Bank, began operations in 2005 when the Bank established a loan production office in Erie, Pennsylvania and started offering commercial loan service to businesses located within Erie and Erie County. During 2006, management opened a full service branch in the Erie market at a temporary location and in 2007 opened its first two full service financial services stores. Two additional full service financial services stores were opened in the Erie community in 2008. The primary market area for the ERIEBANK division is the north western Pennsylvania county of Erie including the city of Erie and the city of Meadville located in Crawford county. The approximate population of the general trade area is 450,000. The economy is diversified and includes manufacturing industries, wholesale and retail trade, services industries, family farms and the production of natural resources of coal, oil, gas and timber. In addition to the Main Office, the Bank has 24 full-service branch offices and 2 loan production offices located in various communities in its market area. 4 Table of Contents The Bank is a full-service bank engaging in a full range of banking activities and services for individual, business, governmental and institutional customers. These activities and services principally include checking, savings, and time deposit accounts; real estate, commercial, industrial, residential and consumer loans; and a variety of other specialized financial services such as wealth management. Its trust division offers a full range of client services. The Banks customer base is such that loss of one customer relationship or a related group of depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on the business of the Bank. The Banks loan portfolio is diversified so that one industry, group of related industries or changes in household economic conditions would not comprise a material portion of the loan portfolio. The Banks business is not seasonal nor does it have any risks attendant to foreign sources. HOLIDAY FINANCIAL SERVICES CORPORATION In 2005, the Corporation formed Holiday Financial Services Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary, and entered the consumer discount loan and finance business with one office located in Sidman, Pennsylvania. During 2006, three offices were opened in the communities of Hollidaysburg, Northern Cambria and Clearfield, Pennsylvania. In 2007, three additional offices in the communities of Bellefonte, Ridgway and Bradford, Pennsylvania were opened, and in 2008, one additional office was opened in Erie, Pennsylvania, bringing our total to eight. Holiday Financial Services Corporation is currently not material to the Corporation based on revenue, net income or total asset measurements; however, the Corporation plans to continue growing this entity. Management is making the necessary investments in experienced personnel and technology which we believe will facilitate the growth of Holiday Financial Services into a successful and profitable subsidiary of the Corporation in future years. COMPETITION The financial services industry in the Corporations service area continues to be extremely competitive, both among commercial banks and with other financial service providers such as consumer finance companies, thrifts, investment firms, mutual funds and credit unions. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal and regulatory guidelines as well as from economic conditions. Mortgage banking firms, leasing companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies, brokerage firms, retirement fund management firms, and even government agencies provide additional competition for loans and other financial services. Some of the financial service providers operating in the Corporations market area operate on a large-scale regional or national basis and possess resources greater than those of the Corporation. The Corporation is generally competitive with all competing financial institutions in its service area with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION The Bank is subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies, including the Pennsylvania State Department of Banking. The Bank is insured by and subject to some or all of the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types, amounts and terms and conditions of loans that may be granted, and limitation on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operation of the Bank. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, including actions taken with respect to interest rates, as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The table below lists the executive officers of the Corporation and CNB Bank and sets forth certain information with respect to such persons. Name Age Principal Occupation for Last Five Years William F. Falger 61 President and Chief Executive Officer, CNB Financial Corporation, since January 1, 2001; President and Chief Executive Officer, CNB Bank, since January 1, 1993. 5 Table of Contents Joseph B. Bower, Jr. 45 Secretary, CNB Financial Corporation, since December 31, 2003; Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, CNB Bank, since December 31, 2003; and previously Chief Financial Officer, CNB Bank, since November 10, 1997.

Guarino 46 Treasurer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, CNB Financial Corporation, since April 18, 2006; Chief Financial Officer, CNB Bank, since April 13, 2004 and Previously a Certified Public Accountant in Public Practice. Richard L. Sloppy 58 Executive Vice President and Senior Loan Officer, CNB Bank, since January 1, 2004; and previously Vice President Commercial Banking, CNB Bank, since October 5, 1998. Officers are elected annually at the reorganization meeting of the Board of Directors. EMPLOYEES The Corporation has no employees who are not employees of CNB Bank except for 21 individuals who are employees of Holiday Financial Services Corporation. As of December 31, 2008, the Corporation had a total of 303 employees of which 256 were full time and 47 were part time. MONETARY POLICIES The earnings and growth of the banking industry are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities, including the Federal Reserve System. An important function of the Federal Reserve System is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to control recessionary and inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market activities in U.S. Government Securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These operations are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and indirectly, bank loans, securities, and deposits. These variables may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve authorities have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future. In view of the changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the Federal Reserve System, no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or their effect on the business and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank.

In determining the allocation of the allowance for loan losses, the Corporation considers economic trends, historical patterns and specific credit reviews. 2. With regard to the credit reviews, a watchlist is evaluated on a monthly basis to determine potential commercial losses. Consumer loans and mortgage loans are allocated using historical loss experience. The total of these reserves is deemed allocated, while the remaining balance is unallocated. Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses The unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses has been eliminated beginning in 2007 as management has refined its methodology for monitoring and measuring credit risk. In 2008 and 2007, additional individual loans were subject to specific review, resulting in an increase in specific allowance allocations. In addition, consideration of current economic risk factors were applied to individual pools of homogeneous loans. In prior years, economic risk factors were applied to the portfolio of loans as a whole and were reflected as unallocated. 11 Table of Contents DEPOSITS (Dollars In Thousands) December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AverageAmount AnnualRate AverageAmount AnnualRate AverageAmount AnnualRate Demand - Non Interest Bearing $ 97,578 $ 86,382 $ 79,588 Demand - Interest Bearing 207,293 1.42 % 151,854 1.81 % 138,226 1.36 % Savings Deposits 98,463 1.96 % 52,500 0.81 % 59,090 0.59 % Time Deposits 349,544 2.88 % 354,527 4.20 % 344,801 4.32 % TOTAL $ 752,878 $ 645,263 $ 621,705 The maturity of certificates of deposits and other time deposits in denomination of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2008 (Dollars In Thousands) Maturing in: Three months or less $ 12,464 Greater than three months and through twelve months 13,089 Greater than one year and through three years 70,833 Greater than three years 14,463 $ 110,849 12 Table of Contents Key ratios for the Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 appear in the Annual Shareholders Report for the year ended December 31, 2008 under the caption Selected Financial Data on pages 37 and 38 and are incorporated herein by reference.

RISK FACTORS Investments in CNB Financial Corporation common stock involve risk. The market price of CNB Financial Corporation common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of items which are mainly beyond the control of the Corporation and could include, but are not limited to, the following:  Changes in the market valuations of similar corporations  Changes in interest rates  Volatility of stock market prices and volumes  Rumors or erroneous information  New developments in the financial services industry  Variations in quarterly or annual operating results  Litigation or regulatory actions  Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies.  Business conditions in the communities we serve  Economic and political conditions  Credit standards  Additional capital for future  Competition  Allowance for loans losses If CNB Financial Corporation does not adjust to future changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer. As such, the Corporations ability to maintain its history of strong financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand its scope of available financial services to its customers. In addition to other banks, competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, and finance and insurance companies. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. Future governmental regulation and legislation could limit growth. CNB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legislation that govern nearly every aspect of its operations. Changes to these laws could affect CNB Financial Corporations ability to deliver or expand its services and diminish the value of its business. Changes in interest rates could reduce income and cash flow. CNB Financial Corporations income and cash flow depends to a great extent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rates are beyond CNB Financial Corporations control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Additional factors could have a negative effect on the financial performance of CNB Financial Corporation and CNB Financial Corporation common stock. Some of these factors are general economic and financial market conditions, competition, continuing consolidation in the financial services industry, litigation, regulatory actions, and losses.
