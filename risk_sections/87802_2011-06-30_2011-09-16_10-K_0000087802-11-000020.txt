Item 1A. Risk Factors. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, important risk factors are identified below that could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to such future periods in any current statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking announcements to reflect future events or circumstances. Dependence on a Major Customer ______________________________ The laboratory equipment industry is dominated in the U.S. by two major laboratory equipment distributors, one of which, is the Company's largest customer for the Company's Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products. Sales to this customer, accounted for 14.6% and 14.5%, respectively, of the sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. No representation can be made that the Company will be successful in continuing to retain this customer, the loss of which could have an adverse effect on future operating results of the Company. One Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Product Accounts for a Substantial Portion of Revenues ________________________________________________________ The Company has a limited number of Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products with one product, the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer, accounting for approximately 68% of Benchtop Laboratory Equipment sales, for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, and 52% and 41% of total sales for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The Company is a Small Participant in Each of the Industries in Which It Operates _______________________________________________________________ The Benchtop Laboratory Equipment industry is highly competitive. Although the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer has been widely accepted, the annual sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products ($4,525,100 for fiscal 2011 and $4,272,700 for fiscal 2010) are significantly lower than the annual sales of many of its competitors in the industry. The principal competitors are substantially larger with much greater financial, production and marketing resources than the Company. There are constant new entrants into the vortex mixer market, including products imported from China. The production and sale of Catalyst Research Instruments products is highly competitive. Altamira's competitors include several companies with greater resources and many laboratories which produce their own instruments. 8 The Company's Ability to Grow and Compete Effectively Depends In Part on Its Ability to Develop and Effectively Market New Products _____________________________________________________________________ Over the past ten years, the Company has continuously invested in the development and marketing of new Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products with a view to increasing revenues and reducing the Company's dependence on the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer. Gross revenues derived from new Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products (those other than the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer) increased to $1,484,000 for fiscal 2011 from $1,389,400, for fiscal 2010. However, the segment's ability to compete will depend upon the Company's success in continuing to develop and market new laboratory equipment as to which no assurance can be given. The Company relies primarily on distributors and their catalogs to market its Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products, as is customary in the industry. Accordingly, sales of new products are heavily dependent on the distributors' decision to include and retain a new product in the distributors' catalogs and on their websites. It may be at least 24 to 36 months between the completion of development of a product and the distribution of the catalog in which it is first offered, and not all distributors feature the Company's products in their catalogs. In fiscal 2010, the Company hired a new sales manager to bolster its sales efforts in the United States, and in May 2011, the Company engaged a consultant overseas as its European Sales Manager. The Company's Catalyst Research Instruments line of products consists of only a few products. The ability of the Company to compete in this segment and expand the line will depend on its ability to make engineering improvements to existing products and develop and add new products incorporating more current technology. Over the last two years the Company has introduced two new catalyst research products to increase its product offerings and has continuously looked to expand its outside sales force. No assurance can be given that the amounts allocated by the Company for its new product development and sales and marketing programs will be sufficient to develop additional commercially feasible products or that distributors will include or retain any particular product in their catalogs and websites. The Company May Be Subject to General Economic, Political, and Social Factors ______________________________________________________________ Orders for the Company's products, particularly its Catalyst Research Instruments products, depend in part, on the customer's ability to secure funds to finance purchases. Availability of funds can be affected by budgetary constraints. Factors such as a general economic recession, such as the one which commenced in fiscal 2009 and negatively affected the Company in fiscal 2011, or major terrorist attack could have a negative impact on the availability of funding including government or academic grants to potential customers. The Company's ability to secure new Catalyst Research Instruments orders can also be affected by changes in domestic and international policies pertaining to energy and the environment, which could affect funding of potential customers. The Company is Heavily Dependent on Outside Suppliers for the Components of Its Products _____________________________________________________________ The Company purchases all its components from outside suppliers and relies on a few single suppliers for certain of its Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products, including the Vortex-Genie 2, mostly due to cost considerations. To reduce the risk of component shortages, the Company maintains higher than normal inventories of such components. Many of the Company's suppliers, including United States vendors, produce the components directly or indirectly in overseas factories, and orders are subject to long lead times and potential other risks related to production in a foreign country. To minimize the risk of supply shortages, the Company keeps more than normal quantities on hand of the critical components that cannot easily be procured or, where feasible and cost effective, purchases are made from more than one supplier. 9 The Company's Ability to Compete Depends in Part on Its Ability To Secure and Maintain Proprietary Rights to its Products __________________________________________________________________ The Company has no patent protection for its principal Laboratory Equipment products, the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer, and Catalyst Research products and limited patent protection on a few other Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products. There are several competitive products available in the marketplace possessing similar technical specifications and design. The Company does not have any patent protection for any of its Catalyst Research Instruments products. If the proposed acquisition of the License and sublicenses under the UMBC patent is successfully consummated, the Company's ability to conduct business in the related business will depend on the ability of the Company and the Licensor to maintain validity and enforceability of the related patent and to obtain related foreign patents. There can be no assurance that any patent issued or licensed to the Company provides or will provide the Company with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or design around the patents. Any of the foregoing activities could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, the enforcement by the Company of its patent or license rights may require substantial litigation costs. The Company Has Limited Management Resources ____________________________________________ The loss of the services of any of Ms. Helena Santos, the Company's Chief Executive and Financial Officer and President, Mr. Robert Nichols, the Company?s Executive Vice President and Mr. Brookman March, President of Altamira, or any material expansion of the Company's operations could place a significant additional strain on the Company?s limited management resources and could be materially adverse to the Company's operating results and financial condition. The Common Stock of the Company is Thinly Traded and is Subject to Volatility __________________________________________________________________ As of August 19, 2011, there were only 1,196,577 shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding, of which 331,772 shares (28%) were held by the directors and officers of the Company. The Common Stock of the Company is traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and, historically, has been thinly traded. There have been a number of trading days during fiscal 2011 on which no trades of the Company's Common Stock were reported. Accordingly, the market price for the Common Stock is subject to great volatility.
