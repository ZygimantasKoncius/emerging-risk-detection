Item 1A. Risk Factors â€“ continued. Any failure or circumvention of controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on Capitol's business, results of operations and financial condition. Capitol's Bylaws, as Well as Certain Banking Laws, May Have an Anti-Takeover Effect. Provisions of Capitol's bylaws, the Michigan Control Share Act, and certain federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Capitol, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to shareholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of Capitol's common stock. Capitol's Bank Subsidiaries Have Decentralized Management Which Could Have a Negative Impact on the Rate of Growth and Profitability of Capitol and its Bank Subsidiaries. Capitol's bank subsidiaries have independent boards of directors and management teams. This decentralized structure gives the banks control over the day-to-day management of the institution, including credit decisions, the selection of personnel, the pricing of loans and deposits, marketing decisions and the strategy in handling problem loans. This decentralized structure may impact Capitol's ability to uniformly implement corporate or enterprise-wide strategy at the bank level. It may slow Capitol's ability to react to changes in strategic direction due to outside factors such as interest rate changes and changing economic conditions. This decentralized structure may cause additional management time to be spent on internal issues and could negatively impact the growth and profitability of the banks individually and the parent company.
