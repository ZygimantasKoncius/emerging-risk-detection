RISK FACTORS The key risks to our business are included below. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment that is subject to rapid change and we must continue to invest and adapt to remain competitive. Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. These markets continue to change in response to technological innovations, changing legislation and other factors. We cannot predict with certainty the changes that may occur and the effect of those changes on the competitiveness of our businesses. In particular, the means of delivering our products and services, and the products and services themselves, may be subject to rapid technological and other changes. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, make some of our products wholly or partially obsolete. We may be required to invest significant resources to further adapt to the changing competitive environment. We cannot assure you that there will be continued demand for our products and services. Our businesses are dependent on the continued acceptance by our customers of our products and services and the prices which we charge for our products and services. We cannot predict whether there will be changes in the future, either in the market demand or from the actions of competitors, which will affect the acceptability of products, services and prices to our customers. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect our reported results. Our financial statements are expressed in pounds sterling and euros and are, therefore, subject to movements in exchange rates on the translation of the financial information of businesses whose operational currencies are other than our reporting currencies. The United States is our most important market and, accordingly, significant fluctuations in US dollar/sterling and US dollar/euro exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results from year to year. In addition, in some of our businesses we incur costs in currencies other than those in which revenues are earned. The relative movements between the exchange rates in the currencies in which costs are incurred and the currencies in which revenues are earned can significantly affect the results of those businesses. Changes in tax laws or uncertainty over their application and interpretation may adversely affect our reported results. Our businesses operate in over 100 locations worldwide and our earnings are subject to taxation in many differing jurisdictions and at differing rates. We seek to organise our affairs in a tax efficient manner, taking account of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws that apply to Reed Elsevier businesses may be amended by the relevant authorities, for example as a result of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities. Such amendments, or their application to Reed Elsevier businesses, may adversely affect our reported results. Changes in regulation on information collection and use could adversely affect our revenues and our costs. Legal regulation relating to internet communications, data protection, e-commerce, direct marketing and digital advertising and use of public records is becoming more prevalent. Existing and proposed legislation and regulations, including changes in the manner in which such legislation and regulations are interpreted by courts, in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions may impose limits on our collection and use of certain kinds of information about individuals and our ability to communicate such information effectively with our customers. We are unable to predict in what form laws and regulations will be adopted or how they will be construed by the courts, or the extent to which any changes might adversely affect our business. Breaches of our data security systems or other unauthorised access to our databases could adversely affect our business and operations. Our businesses provide customers with access to database information such as caselaw, treatises, journals, and publications as well as other data. Our LexisNexis risk management business also provides authorised customers with access to public records and other information on US individuals made available in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. There are persons who try to breach our data security systems or gain other unauthorised access to our databases in order to misappropriate such information for potentially fraudulent purposes and we have previously disclosed incidents of such unauthorised access. Because the techniques used by such persons change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate or protect against the threat of breaches of data security or other unauthorised access. Breaches of our data security systems or other unauthorised access to our databases could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, as well as increase the likelihood of more extensive governmental regulation of these activities in a way that could adversely affect this aspect of our business. 8 Table of Contents Changes in government funding of, or spending by, schools, academic institutions and states may adversely affect demand for the products and services of our education and science and medical businesses. The customers of our Harcourt Education business in the United States include state boards of education and local school districts, which rely on various sources of governmental funding, primarily from state and local governments, to purchase products and services offered by our education business. The principal customers for the information products and services offered by our Elsevier science and medical publishing business are academic institutions, which fund purchases of these products and services from limited budgets that may be sensitive to changes in private and governmental sources of funding. Accordingly any decreases or delays in governmental funding for schools, decreases in budgets of academic institutions or changes in the spending patterns of schools or academic institutions could adversely affect our businesses. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under current laws in some jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our results and our ability to grow. Our products and services are largely comprised of intellectual property content delivered through a variety of media, including journals, books, CDs, and online, including the internet. We rely on trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in these products and services. However, we cannot assure you that our proprietary rights will not be challenged, limited, invalidated or circumvented. Despite trademark and copyright protection and similar intellectual property protection laws, third parties may be able to copy, infringe or otherwise profit from our proprietary rights without our authorisation. These unauthorised activities may be facilitated by the internet. In addition, whilst there is now certain internet-specific copyright legislation in the United States and in the European Union, there remains significant uncertainty as to the date from which these will be enforced and the form copyright law regulating digital content may ultimately take. In the United States, copyright laws are increasingly coming under legal challenge and, in the European Union, national legislation by the member states implementing the EU Copyright Directive has not yet been adopted. These factors create additional challenges for us in protecting our proprietary rights to content delivered through the internet and electronic platforms. Moreover, whilst non-copyrightable databases are protected in many circumstances by law in the European Union, there is no equivalent legal protection in the United States. Changes in the market values of defined benefit pension scheme assets and in the assumptions used to value defined benefit pension scheme obligations may adversely affect our businesses. We operate a number of pension schemes around the world, the largest schemes being of the defined benefit type in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands. The assets and obligations associated with defined benefit pension schemes are particularly sensitive to changes in the market values of assets and the market related assumptions used to value scheme liabilities. In particular, a decrease in the discount rate used to value scheme liabilities, an increase in life expectancy of scheme members, an increase in the rate of inflation or a decline in the market value of investments held by the defined benefit pension schemes (absent any change in their expected long term rate of return) may adversely affect the reported results and financial position of the combined businesses. We may be unable to implement and execute our strategic and business plans if we cannot maintain high quality management. The implementation and execution of our strategic and business plans depend on the availability of high quality management resources across all our businesses. We cannot predict that in the future such resources will be available. We cannot assure you whether our substantial investment in electronic product and platform initiatives will produce satisfactory, long term returns. We are investing significant amounts to develop and promote electronic products and platforms. The provision of electronic products and services is very competitive and we may experience difficulties developing this aspect of our business due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors may include competition from comparable and new technologies, new business models and changes in regulation. Our businesses may be adversely affected if their electronic delivery platforms, networks or distribution systems experience a significant failure or interruption. Our businesses are increasingly dependent on electronic platforms and distribution systems, primarily the internet, for delivery of their products and services. Although plans and procedures are in place to reduce such risks, our businesses could be adversely affected if their electronic delivery platforms and networks experience a significant failure or interruption. 9 Table of Contents Our scientific, technical and medical primary journals could be adversely affected by changes in the market. The scientific, technical and medical (STM) primary publications of Elsevier, like those of most of our competitors, are published on a paid subscription basis. There has been recent debate in the academic and library communities, which are the principal customers for our STM publications, regarding whether such publications should be free and funded instead through fees charged to authors and from governmental and other subsidies or made freely available after a period following publication. If these methods of STM publishing are widely adopted, it could adversely affect our revenue from Elseviers paid subscription publications. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising and exhibitions and spending by companies on advertising and other marketing activities has historically been cyclical. Approximately 13% of our revenue in 2006 was derived from advertising and 10% from exhibitions. The Reed Business segment in particular is highly dependent on advertising and exhibitions revenue. In 2006, 36% of Reed Business segment revenue was derived from advertising and 36% from exhibitions. Traditionally, spending by companies on advertising and other marketing activities has been cyclical with companies spending significantly less on advertising in times of economic slowdown or recession. Our results could be adversely affected by a reduction of advertising revenues following economic slowdown or recession. The exhibitions business is similarly affected by cyclical pressures on spending by companies. Additionally, participation and attendance at exhibitions is affected by the availability of exhibition venues and the propensity of exhibitors and attendees to travel. Our results could be adversely affected if the availability of venues or the demand from exhibitors and attendees were reduced, for example due to international security or public health concerns or acts of terrorism or war. 10 Table of Contents
