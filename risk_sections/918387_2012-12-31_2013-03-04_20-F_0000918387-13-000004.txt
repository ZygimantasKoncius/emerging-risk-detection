Risk Factors below. 5 We have lost money in the past, we may continue to sustain losses in the future and we may never achieve continued profitability. We have failed to generate sufficient revenues from the sales of our solutions and licensing of our products to achieve profitability in three of the last five years, including reporting net losses of $4,368,000 for the recent year ended December 31, 2012, and $5,537,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Although we did achieve profitability in 2010 and 2009, reporting $1,867,000 and $1,911,000 in net income, respectively, a substantial portion of the income recognized in those years was from one-time, non-operational events. Specifically, in 2010 $3,061,000 of our net income was attributable to the cancellation of 6,956,152 common shares as part of a settlement agreement with our principal customer and $190,000 was attributable to foreign exchange gains. For the year ended December 31, 2009, $1,253,000 of the $1,911,000 reported net income was from foreign exchange gains. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we posted a net loss of $1,949,000. Our continuing losses and limited financial resources have resulted in us issuing a going concern note in our annual consolidated financial statements. If we cannot meet our operating costs or capital requirements going forward or if we fail either to raise capital when needed or to generate revenues, we may be compelled to cease operations. Based in part upon our continued losses and the significant amounts of cash used in our operating activities during our most recent fiscal year, and as detailed in note 1 to the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements, there are certain conditions and events that cast substantial doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. As a consequence, our continued operations depend upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or obtain additional financing to fund future operations and, ultimately, to generate positive cash flows from operating activities. Should revenue from our operations, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents ($3,162,000 as at December 31, 2012) prove inadequate to meet our short-term working capital requirements during the next twelve months, we may need to raise additional amounts to meet our working capital requirements through private or public financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements to support our operations beyond the next twelve months. Although we have obtained funding for operations from private equity placements in the past, there is no assurance we will be able to do so again in the near future at commercially reasonable terms or at all despite any progress in our business operations. In light of continuing volatility in the credit markets and any disruptions or decline in our financial performance or outlook, public or private debt funding may not be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. If we enter into strategic relationships to raise additional funds, we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies. Ultimately, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing or generating positive cash flows from operations. Our failure to generate positive cash flows from operations or to raise capital or secure financing when needed could leave us with insufficient resources in the future to sustain our operations over the next twelve months. Without additional capital resources, we may be forced to limit, defer or cease our operations, and in turn negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business plan is dependent upon customer adoption and commercial deployment of our products; if our business plan is not accepted, we may need to cease operations. Our ability to continue operations is also dependent on the acceptance of our secure software and related solutions and the adoption of advanced authentication protected applications over web and mobile data networks as an accepted method of personal information protection in sufficient volume for us to generate enough revenues to fund our expenses and capital requirements. Our technology helps healthcare payers and providers, pharmaceutical companies, application developers and other healthcare organizations address the increasing need for secure messaging, as well as safe, convenient storage and sharing of personal health data. The healthcare personal authentication and security solutions market is still in a very early stage, and it may not develop to a sufficient level to support our business. We market our solutions to large companies, application developers and solution providers with specific market area expertise. The implementation of our solutions by these entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources. This process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital expenditures, deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations. As a result, the associated sales and implementation cycles can be lengthy. Our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized. Many of our early licensing agreements permitted our customers to examine and test our products with no initial up-front payments to us. These customers are not required to make payments to us until they begin to use our solutions for commercial purposes. In certain cases, we also enter into evaluation agreements, whereby potential customers may examine our solutions for a specified period of time with no payment to us. Our current licensing agreements typically require the customer to pay a license fee attributable to the software components and the solution upon shipment of these items to the customer, although we have sometimes waived the up-front fee. 6 The purchase of our solutions often requires our customers to make a significant capital investment, which customers may view as a discretionary cost and, therefore, a purchase that can be deferred or cancelled due to budgetary or other business reasons. Because the healthcare industry is characterized by longer sales cycles, the multi-year contracts with our customers, such as our reseller agreement with Mihealth Global Systems (Mihealth), often provide for early cancellation if there is slow customer adoption, regardless of provisions calling for minimum threshold amounts to be payable to us. Certain other contracts, including our mCare telehealth outreach program with the U.S. Armys Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, do not have any minimum commitments. Other contracts are cancellable with limited notice periods. During the third quarter of 2012, Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C. indicated that it will not be continuing its medication adherence platform with Diversinet beyond the second quarter of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2012, Intersections, Inc. advised us that they will be terminating their License and Value Added Reseller agreement (from 2007) as of April 1, 2013. Furthermore, our customers may default on their obligations under these agreements or seek to renegotiate certain of their financial obligations. We have a limited number of customers. The loss of, or a significant reduction in business from, any of these customers would materially harm our business and results of operations, and our future prospects depend substantially on expanding our customer base. During fiscal 2012, 48% of our revenue was generated from one customer and 15% of revenue was generated from another customer. Our agreements with the U.S. Armys Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (part of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command) which is multi year agreement but renewable on an annual basis by the Army, and Mihealth Global Systems are our only long term license agreements as at December 31, 2012. During fiscal 2011, 39% of revenue was generated from one customer and 31% of revenue was generated from another customer. During fiscal 2010, 76% of revenue was generated from one customer and 21% of revenue was generated from another customer. The loss of revenues from one or more significant customers, or the failure to collect receivables due from a major customer in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In 2010, the agreement with our then principal customer, AllOne, was terminated as part of a settlement with such customer. In 2012, we were notified that our agreements with Johnson & Johnson and Intersections would be terminated. If we are unable either to keep existing customers or to expand our customer base, our results of operations will suffer. Our ability to keep pace with the rapid technological changes and frequent new product introductions common in the information and communications technology industry will determine our ability to remain competitive and affect the viability of our products. To succeed in the mobile healthcare (mHealth) applications business, we believe that we will have to continuously improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and be the first to the market with new products or enhancements to existing products. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to improve our products in a timely manner. The emerging market for secure mobile healthcare application solutions is characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The adoption of new standards, or the informal adoption of certain standards by a significant percentage of the computer security and related industries, could require us to reconfigure our products. We may not be able to counter challenges to our current products or to introduce product offerings that keep pace with the technological changes introduced by competitors or persons seeking to breach information security. We are not currently aware of any significant new technologies either under development or about to be introduced in the mobile data security or the mobile healthcare application solutions security field. Further, our authentication and mobile healthcare application products depend in part on the application of certain mathematical principles forming the basis of the encryption technology which is embedded in our products. Any significant advancement in techniques for decoding or cracking encrypted computer information could render some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable. Our products use algorithms, or mathematical formulae, to encrypt and secure information. The security afforded by our products is predicated on the assumption that these mathematical formulae are very difficult to solve. This assumption is based on the fact that years of theoretical and empirical research by leading mathematicians have not resulted in any efficient solutions to these problems. There can be no assurance, however, that future research will not uncover efficient solutions to these problems. 7 Also, even if no breakthrough in solving these problems is discovered, they may eventually be solved by computer systems having sufficient speed and power. If improved techniques for decoding encrypted information are developed or made possible by the increased availability of powerful computing resources, our products could be rendered obsolete. We might not always be able to enforce our intellectual property rights. Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology, and our means of protecting our proprietary and intellectual property rights may not be adequate. We rely on a combination of patent and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. We have ten U.S. patents, which will be in effect until at least August 22, 2017, four patents granted in Israel in effect until at least 2017, and eight Canadian patent in effect until 2027. We also have 26 applications pending in the United States and Canada. We cannot provide assurance that any of our applications will be approved, that any new patents will be issued, that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are subject to patent, that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. There is also a risk that our competitors will independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around our patents or other intellectual property rights. We also cannot assure you that others will not seek and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our technology either in the United States or in international markets. If our technology or products were determined to infringe upon the rights of others, we would be required to obtain licenses to use that technology. If we are not able to obtain a license in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all, we may have to stop producing our product until we can develop an alternative that does not infringe the rights of others. Patent disputes are common in technology-related industries. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights action, including the above referenced possible claim of misappropriation. As the number of products and competitors in our target markets grows, the likelihood of infringement claims also increases. Any claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, cause product shipment delays or require us to redesign our product or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to use our proprietary information and software. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to as great an extent as do the laws of Canada and the United States. Data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and product integration issues could disrupt our operations or information technology services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. Our product and service offerings may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including sensitive and personally identifiable information with respect to customers, patients and others. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. The methods used by hackers are evolving rapidly and generally are not recognized until they are launched against one or more systems. We are unable to anticipate hackers tactics. In addition, the operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our authentication and authorization products. Any compromise or breach of the cyber security offered by our products, in a single incident or a series of incidents, could expose us, our customers, their patients or others affected to a risk of loss or misuse, including the loss of valuable information or intellectual property or the inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of such information, resulting in litigation and potential liability to us for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach (including business incentives to make amends with affected customers and business partners), additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents, litigation costs resulting from the incident and lost revenues. We also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products. Publicity surrounding a cyber security breach could cause damage to our brand and reputation, adversely affecting the public perception of the security offered by our authentication and authorization products and making it more difficult for us to sell our products. The costs and operational consequences to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions. 8 The nature of our products subjects us to product liability risks, potential lost revenues and adverse publicity in the event of product failure. Our customers may rely on our products to prevent unauthorized access to computer networks. Malfunctions or design defects of our products could: · cause interruptions, delays or cessation of services to our customers, · result in product returns, · result in liability for damages, · adversely affect the market’s perception of the security offered by our product, resulting in a lack of demand for our products, or · Require us to make significant expenditures to alleviate the problem. Our license agreements may not be adequate to limit our liability. A large number of claims by our customers could subject us to significant liability as well as limit the demand for our solutions and products. In a number of our license and support agreements we attempt to limit our liability to the total amount of the licensing and support fees paid during the twelve-month period preceding an alleged error in or failure of our software. This contractual provision may not always be enforceable. Courts have held that contractual limitations of liability of this type, or the shrink-wrap licenses in which they are sometimes embodied, are unenforceable because the licensee does not sign them. If these contract provisions limiting our liability are not enforceable, we could be obligated to pay significant damages resulting from customer claims. The highly competitive nature of the information and communications technology fields could prevent us from achieving success. Our solutions are targeted at the new and rapidly evolving market for secure mobile healthcare applications. This market is not mature. We anticipate that it will be intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new solutions, product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have a longer operating history, greater name recognition, larger installed customer base and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and they could therefore render our technologies and products obsolete. Because of the broad potential application of our technology, we compete with vendors offering a wide range of products. These competitors include mobile security vendors such as Good Technology, Mocana, and EMC Corp. (RSA Division) and mobile application development platforms such as Kony and Verivo and Rhomobile. There also may be other potential entrants to the market of whom we are not yet aware. We lack experience in sales and marketing, and we depend on our relationships with more established corporations to assist in selling and marketing our products. We have limited sales and marketing experience and limited money to fund marketing. A significant part of our business strategy is to form strategic relationships with more established companies to expose our solutions to a larger customer base than we could reach through a direct sales and marketing force. Our existing relationships have resulted in limited revenues to date and may not result in any additional revenues in the future. As a result of our emphasis on these relationships, our success will partially depend on both the ultimate success of the third parties with whom we have these relationships and the ability of these third parties to market our products and services successfully. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to enter into additional, or maintain our existing, strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In 2010, the agreement with our then principal customer, AllOne, was terminated as part of a settlement with such customer. In 2012, we were notified that our agreements with Johnson & Johnson and Intersections would be terminated. Our failure to maintain existing relationships would require us to devote substantially more resources to the distribution, sales and marketing of our products and services. Also, these strategic relationships do not afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights. The third parties may reduce their commitments to us in the future or pursue alternative technologies. 9 Changes in the regulation of healthcare-based technologies may restrict our ability to sell or license our products. Our products attempt to conform with certain healthcare laws regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which addresses the need for security standards to protect the confidentiality and integrity of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA security rules require a risk-based security assessment and the implementation of appropriate authentication for access to electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). These laws and regulations may be revised from time to time in ways that may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products abroad or to make products available for sale or license. Government controls relating to healthcare technologies may, if subject to revision, be amended and subsequently restrict our ability to freely sell our products. Changes in the export regulation of encryption-based technologies may restrict our ability to sell or license our products. Our products are subject to export controls under Canadian and U.S. laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may be revised from time to time in ways that may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products abroad or to make products available for sale or license via international computer networks such as the Internet, although pursuant to an international treaty, a number of countries have relaxed, or are in the process of relaxing, their export rules as applicable to products licensed by us. Canadian and U.S. government controls on the export of encryption technologies which we license from third parties and which are embedded in our products may, if subject to revision, be amended and subsequently restrict our ability to freely export our products. As a result, foreign competitors subject to less stringent export controls on their products may be able to compete more effectively than we can in the global information and computer security market. We may not be successful if we fail to attract and retain our key technical personnel. We currently have two senior officers, 26 employees and 3 contractors. We may not be able to improve our solutions and products or create new products if we lose any of our key employees or contractors. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. Skilled technical personnel can be difficult to attract depending on the strength of the economy and competitive opportunities. We may not be able to retain our current employees if they receive better job offers from other employers. Fluctuations in foreign exchange may adversely affect our business. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Sales generated outside Canada are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2012, we incurred a portion of our expenses in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. Changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar may result in currency losses that may have an adverse effect on our operating results. During fiscal 2012 and 2011 we maintained a portion of our cash resources in both U.S. and Canadian dollar term deposits. We do not have any foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2012. We have been involved in litigation. Our Company has previously been named as a defendant in various proceedings arising in the course of our Companys activities and arising from transactions relating to a previous business operated by our Company. Litigation arising from these matters may be time consuming, distracting and expensive. It may be difficult for our shareholders to enforce civil liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws because we are incorporated in Canada. We are incorporated under Canadian law and the majority of our directors and executive officers are Canadian citizens or residents. All, or a substantial portion, of these persons assets and substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons or us or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws. Also, there is uncertainty as to the enforceability in Canada, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of the U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal or state securities laws. We have a limited ability to design and implement disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We have few employees and limited financial resources which make it difficult for us to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Inherent limitations on the ability of our certifying officers to design and implement on a cost effective basis disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the Company may result in additional risks to the quality, reliability, transparency and timeliness of interim and annual filings and other reports provided under securities legislation. 10 Our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue an unlimited number of common shares, which could result in dilution to our shareholders. Subject to regulatory and/or shareholder approval, shareholders may experience dilution or limitations in takeover attempts because our articles of incorporation allow us to issue an unlimited number of common shares. Our shareholders have no right to purchase additional common shares when we issue new shares. As of December 31, 2012, we had 43,496,847 common shares issued and outstanding. Liquidity risk, ability to sell common shares. If our common shares should become ineligible for continued quotation on the TSX Venture Exchange or the OTC BB or a public trading market does not continue for any reason, holders of our common shares may have difficulty selling their shares on these less liquid junior trading markets. We cannot make any assurances that our common shares will continue to be eligible for trading on these markets. Our common shares may continue to be penny stock, which may adversely affect the liquidity of our common shares. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price, as defined in those regulations, of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our common shares are currently penny stock. Generally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, a broker-dealer is required to deliver, prior to the transaction, a disclosure schedule relating to the penny stock market as well as disclosure concerning, among other things, the commissions payable, current quotations for the securities and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The liquidity of our common shares may be materially and adversely affected if our common shares continue to be penny stock due to the administration requirements imposed by these rules. We may be treated as a passive foreign investment company, which would have adverse tax consequences for our U.S. shareholders. We may be treated as a passive foreign investment company, or a PFIC. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during a taxable year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. Whether we are treated as a PFIC depends on questions of fact concerning our assets and revenues, and accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be determined to be a PFIC by any applicable taxing authority. If we were to be treated as a PFIC, there could be material adverse tax consequences to U.S. holders of our common shares for any taxable year during which they held our common shares, including:  having gains realized on the sale of common shares treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gain;  having interest charges apply to the proceeds of common share sold in prior periods;  realizing no increase in the tax basis for common shares held to fair market value upon shareholders death; and  losing preferential rate applicable to dividends received on common shares held. The determination of whether we are classified as a PFIC is made on an annual basis and will depend on factors such as the composition of our income and assets from time to time as well as our common share price. Therefore, it is possible that we could be classified as a PFIC for any particular year.
