ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors could materially affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may impair our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Disruptions in our bakery-cafe supply chain could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.Our Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes depend on frequent deliveries of ingredients and other products. One company delivers the majority of our ingredients and other products to our bakery-cafes two or three times per week. In addition, we supply Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes with fresh dough and other products on a daily basis. These daily deliveries are particularly susceptible to supply volatility as a result of weather conditions. Our dependence on frequent deliveries to our bakery-cafes could cause shortages or supply interruptions that could adversely impact our operations.Although many of our ingredients and products are prepared to our specifications, we believe that a majority of our ingredients are generally available and could be obtained from alternative sources. In addition, we frequently enter into annual and multi-year contracts for ingredients in order to decrease the risks of supply interruptions and cost fluctuation. Antibiotic-free chicken is sold in most Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes and we have introduced and tested the sale of other antibiotic-free proteins in our Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes. Our antibiotic-free chicken is currently supplied to us by three different companies. However, there are few producers of antibiotic-free chicken or other antibiotic-free proteins, which may make it difficult or more costly for us to find alternative suppliers if necessary.Generally, we believe that we have adequate sources of supply for our ingredients and products to support our bakery-cafe operations or, if necessary, we could make menu adjustments to address material supply issues. However, there are many factors which could cause shortages or interruptions in the supply of our ingredients and products, including weather, unanticipated demand, labor, production or distribution problems, quality issues and cost, and the financial health of our suppliers and distributors.Changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. In the past, we have been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases for, among other things, fuel, proteins, dairy, produce, wheat, tuna, and cream cheese through increased menu prices. There have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases, and economic factors and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety. Historically, the effects of inflation on our consolidated results of operations have not been materially adverse. However, increased volatility in certain commodity markets, including those for wheat, produce, or proteins including chicken or turkey could have an adverse effect on us depending upon whether we are able to increase menu prices to cover such increases.Disruptions or supply issues in our fresh dough facilities could adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations.We operate 22 fresh dough facilities, which service substantially all of our Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes in the United States and Ontario, Canada. Our fresh dough and other product distribution system delivers fresh dough and other products daily to the bakery-cafes through a leased fleet of temperature controlled vehicles. The optimal maximum distribution 7range is approximately 300 miles; although, when necessary, the distribution range may reach up to 500 miles. As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of or distribution from any of our fresh dough facilities, whether due to weather conditions, technical or labor difficulties, destruction, or damage to the vehicle fleet or facility or other reasons, could cause a shortage of fresh dough and other products at our bakery-cafes. Such a shortage of fresh dough and other products could, depending on the extent and duration, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.Additionally, while fuel costs remained relatively constant in 2011 and 2010, given the historical volatility of these costs, increased costs and distribution issues related to fuel and utilities could also materially impact our business and consolidated results of operations, including efficiencies in distribution from our fresh dough facilities to our bakery-cafes.Our Franklin, Massachusetts fresh dough facility manufactures and supplies through its distributors all of the cream cheese and tuna used in most of our Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes in the United States. Although we believe we have adopted adequate quality assurance and other procedures to ensure the production and distribution of quality products and ingredients, we may be subject to allegations regarding quality, health, or other similar concerns that could have a negative impact on our operations, whether or not the allegations are valid or we are liable. Additionally, defending against such claims or litigation could be costly and the results uncertain.Economic conditions in the United States and globally could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources as well as that of our suppliers.As our business depends upon discretionary consumer spending, our financial results may be impacted by the broader global economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending. Our customers may make fewer discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and falling home prices. Because a key point in our business strategy is maintaining our transaction counts, average check amount and margin growth, any significant decrease in customer traffic or average profit per transaction resulting from fewer purchases from our customers or our customers trading down to lower priced products on our menu will negatively impact our financial performance. Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers could result in product delays or shortages. Although there has been some improvement in certain economic indicators, the level of consumer spending across the United States is not where it was prior to the global recession. A stagnant economy or a renewed decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources including our ability to raise additional capital if needed, the willingness of banks to renew our credit facility upon its expiration on March 7, 2013 or honor our draws thereunder, or otherwise negatively impact our business and financial results.We may not be able to continue to convince our customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higher-quality food.Our success depends in large part on our continued ability to convince customers that food made with higher-quality ingredients, including antibiotic-free chicken and turkey, nitrate-free proteins, and our artisan breads, is worth the prices at our bakery-cafes relative to lower prices offered by some of our competitors, particularly those in the quick-service segment. Our inability to successfully educate customers about the quality of our food or our customers’ rejection of our pricing approach could require us to change our pricing, marketing, or promotional strategies, which could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial results or the brand identity that we have tried to create.Customer preferences and traffic could be negatively impacted by health concerns about the consumption of certain products.Customer preferences and traffic could be impacted by health concerns about the consumption of particular food products and could cause a decline in our sales. Negative publicity about ingredients, poor food quality, a production run of items produced in our fresh dough facilities, food-borne illness, injury, health concerns, allergens, or nutritional content could cause customers to shift their preferences. For example, past outbreaks of E. coli in certain beef food products caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains. In addition, outbreaks of salmonella in certain peanuts and peanut butter products, jalapenos and spinach caused consumers to avoid such products. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as hepatitis A or trichinosis), and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, require us to temporarily close bakery-cafes or adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences, particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers. Negative publicity concerning particular food products may adversely affect demand for our products and could cause an increase in our food costs as a result of potentially irregular supply of such products and a decrease in customer traffic to our bakery-cafes.8Our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected if we are unable to execute our growth strategy or achieve sufficient returns on invested capital in bakery-cafe locations.Our growth strategy primarily consists of new market development and further penetration of existing markets, both by us and our franchisees, including the selection of sites which will achieve targeted returns on invested capital. The success of this strategy depends on numerous factors that are not completely controlled by us or involve risks that may impact the development, or timing of development, of our bakery-cafes. Our ability to grow the number of bakery-cafes successfully will depend on a number of factors, including:•general economic conditions;•obstacles to hiring and training qualified operating personnel in the local market;•identification and availability of suitable locations for new bakery-cafes on acceptable terms, including costs and appropriate delivery distances from our fresh dough facilities;•competition for restaurant sites;•variations in the number and timing of bakery-cafe openings as compared to our construction schedule;•management of the costs of construction of bakery-cafes, particularly factors outside our control, such as the timing of delivery of a leased location by the landlord;•our ability to negotiate favorable economic and business terms;•securing required governmental approvals and permits and complying with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations; and•impact of inclement weather, natural disasters, and other acts of nature.Our growth strategy also includes continued development of bakery-cafes through franchising. At December 27, 2011, approximately 52.0 percent of our bakery-cafes were operated by franchisees (801 franchise-operated bakery-cafes out of a total of 1,541 bakery-cafes system-wide). The opening and successful operation of bakery-cafes by franchisees depends on a number of factors, including those identified above, as well as the availability of suitable franchise candidates and the financial and other resources of our franchisees such as our franchisees’ ability to receive financing from banks and other financial institutions, which may become more challenging in the current economic environment.Our success in part depends on the success of our franchisees business.Our success depends in part on the operations of our independent franchisees. While we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, our franchisees, the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our franchisees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a Company-owned or franchise-operated bakery-cafe. Any problems which originate with one of our franchisees, particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience, the safety of our products, or compliance with laws and regulations, may be attributed by customers to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations.Furthermore, our consolidated results of operations include revenues derived from royalties on sales from, and revenues from sales by our fresh dough facilities to, franchise-operated bakery-cafes. As a result, our growth expectations and revenues could be negatively impacted by a material downturn in sales at and to franchise-operated bakery-cafes or if one or more key franchisees becomes insolvent and unable to pay us royalties.Although we have been able to successfully manage our growth to date, we may experience difficulties doing so in the future.Our growth strategy includes selectively opening bakery-cafes in urban trade areas where we may have little operating experience. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a bakery-cafe opened in such trade areas will have similar operating results, including average weekly net sales, as our existing bakery-cafes. New markets may not perform as expected or may take longer to reach planned operating levels, if at all. Operating results or overall bakery-cafe performance in these urban trade areas could vary as a result of higher construction, occupancy, or general operating costs, a lack of familiarity with our brand which may require us to build local brand awareness, differing demographics, consumer tastes, and spending patterns, and variable competitive 9environments. Additional expenses attributable to costs of delivery from our fresh dough facilities may exceed our expectations in areas not currently served by those facilities.Our growth strategy also includes opening bakery-cafes in existing markets to increase the penetration rate of our bakery-cafes in those markets. There can be no assurance we will be successful in operating bakery-cafes profitably in new markets or further penetrating existing markets.We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives, which may have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results.Our business depends upon our ability to continue to grow and evolve through various important strategic initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement these important strategic initiatives, which could in turn adversely affect our business. These strategic initiatives include:•introducing desirable new menu items and improving existing items consistent with customer tastes and expectations;•balancing unit growth while meeting target returns on invested capital for locations;•increasing same store sales and gross profit per transaction through investments in areas such as category management, catering, and technology in an effort to increase overall traffic and transaction count; and•increasing brand awareness through greater investment in multi-channel marketing and advertising, including national television advertising.Our failure or inability to protect our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our business and competitive position.We believe that our intellectual property and confidential and proprietary information is very important to our business and competitive position. Our primary trademarks, Panera®, Panera Bread®, Saint Louis Bread Co.®, Panera Catering®, You Pick Two®, Paradise Bakery®, Paradise Bakery & Café®, the Mother Bread® design, and MyPanera® along with other trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, confidential and proprietary information, and other intellectual property rights, are key components of our operating and marketing strategies. Although we have taken steps to protect our brand, intellectual property, and confidential and proprietary information, these steps may not be adequate. Unauthorized usage or imitation by others could harm our image, brand, or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We are not aware of any assertions that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in marketing or introducing new menu items in the future, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We try to ensure that our franchisees maintain and protect our brand and our confidential and proprietary information. However, since our franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, if they do not operate their bakery-cafes in a manner consistent with their agreements with us, our brand and reputation or the value of our confidential and proprietary information could be harmed. If this occurs, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.Damage to our brands or reputation could negatively impact our business.Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and our reputation for offering a memorable experience with superior customer service. Our brands have been highly rated in annual consumer studies and have received high recognition in several industry publications. We believe that we must protect and grow the value of our brands through our Concept Essence to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and continue our success. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in or affinity for our brands could significantly reduce their value. If consumers do not continue to perceive us as a company that customers can trust to serve high quality food in a warm, friendly, comfortable environment, our brand value could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our business.Competition may adversely affect our operations and consolidated results of operations.The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to location, customer service, price, taste, quality of products, and overall customer experience. We compete with specialty food, casual dining, and quick-service restaurant retailers, including national, regional, and locally owned restaurants. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have greater financial and other resources 10than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing, and the restaurant industry better than we can. Additionally, given our recent success other companies may develop restaurants that operate with concepts similar to ours or that try to replicate the things we do well. We also compete with other restaurant chains and other retail businesses for quality site locations and hourly employees. If we are unable to successfully compete in our markets, we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenues and profitability.Additionally, competition could cause us to modify or evolve our products, designs, or strategies. If we do so, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in implementing the changes or that our profitability will not be negatively impacted.Loss of senior management or the inability to recruit and retain associates could adversely affect our future success.Our success depends on the services of our senior management and associates, all of whom are “at will” employees. The loss of a member of senior management could have an adverse impact on our business or the financial market’s perception of our ability to continue to grow.Our success also depends on our continuing ability to hire, train, motivate, and retain qualified associates in our bakery-cafes, fresh dough facilities, and support centers. Our failure to do so could result in higher associate turnover and increased labor costs, and could compromise the quality of our service, all of which could adversely affect our business.We operate in Canada and therefore, we may be exposed to uncertainties and risks that could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations.We expanded our Company-owned operations into Canadian markets. Our expansion into Canada has made us subject to Canadian economic conditions, particularly currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased regulations, quotas, tariffs, and political factors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations if our Canadian operations continue to expand. Further, we may be exposed to new forms of competition not present in our domestic markets, as well as subject to potentially different demographic tastes and preferences for our products.If we fail to comply with governmental laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations change, our business could suffer.In connection with the operation of our business, we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to:•franchise relationships;•building construction and zoning requirements;•nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements;•management and protection of the personal data of our employees and customers; and•environmental matters.Our bakery-cafes and fresh dough facilities are licensed and subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws, including business, health, fire, and safety codes.In addition, various federal, state, and local labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our associates, including prevailing wages, overtime, accommodation and working conditions, benefits, citizenship requirements, insurance matters, workers’ compensation, disability laws such as the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act, child labor laws, and anti-discrimination laws.While we believe we operate in substantial compliance with these laws, they are complex and vary from location to location, which complicates monitoring and compliance. As a result, regulatory risks are inherent in our operation. Although we believe that compliance with these laws has not had a material effect on our operations to date, we may experience material difficulties or failures with respect to compliance in the future. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in required renovations to our facilities, litigation, fines, penalties, judgments, or other sanctions including the temporary suspension of bakery-cafe or fresh dough facility operations or a delay in construction or opening of a bakery-cafe, any of which could adversely affect our business, operations and our reputation.11Regulatory changes in and customer focus on nutrition and advertising practices could adversely affect our business.There continues to be increased consumer emphasis on and regulatory scrutiny of restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments, with respect to nutrition and advertising practices. While we have taken steps to respond to these developments by updating our menu boards and printed menus to include caloric information in all of our Company-owned bakery-cafes, we may become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising which would require us to make certain additional nutritional information available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients. We may experience higher costs associated with the implementation and oversight of such changes that could have an adverse impact on our business.Rising insurance costs could negatively impact our profitability.We self-insure a significant portion of potential losses under our workers’ compensation, medical, general, auto, and property liability programs. The liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering our historical claims experience and data from industry and other actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves of these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, the costs of insurance and medical care have risen significantly over the past few years and are expected to continue to increase. These increases, as well as existing or potential legislation changes, which requires employers to provide health insurance to employees, could negatively impact our operating results.We are subject to complaints and litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business.In the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to complaints and litigation alleging that we are responsible for a customer illness or injury suffered at or after a visit to one of our Company-owned bakery-cafes or to one of our franchise-operated bakery-cafes, including allegations of poor food quality, food-borne illness, adverse health effects, nutritional content, advertising claims, allergens, personal injury, or other concerns. In addition, we are subject to litigation by employees, investors, franchisees, and others through private actions, class actions or other forums, of which the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess and quantify and the defense against such claims or actions can be costly. In addition to decreasing sales and profitability and diverting financial and management resources, we may suffer from adverse publicity that could harm our brand, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable. Moreover, we are subject to the same risks of adverse publicity resulting from allegations even if the claim involves one of our franchisees. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, publicity about these claims may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results.We rely heavily on information technology and any material failure, interruption, or security breach in our systems could adversely affect our business.We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for the order and delivery of fresh dough from our fresh dough facilities, point-of-sale processing in our bakery-cafes, gift and loyalty cards, online business, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution, and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem. Additionally, if a person is able to circumvent the security measures intended to protect our employee or customer private data, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations, which could significantly harm our reputation or result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.We periodically acquire existing bakery-cafes from our franchisees or ownership interests in other restaurant or bakery-cafe concepts, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.We have historically acquired existing bakery-cafes and development rights from our franchisees either by negotiated agreement or exercise of our rights of first refusal under the franchise and area development agreements. Any acquisition that we undertake involves risk, including:•our ability to successfully achieve anticipated synergies, accurately assess contingent and other liabilities as well as potential profitability;•failure to successfully integrate the acquired entity’s operational and support activities;12•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions;•limited or no operational experience in the acquired bakery-cafe market;•future impairment charges related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and•risks of dispute and litigation with the seller, the seller’s landlords, and vendors and other parties.Any of these factors could strain our financial and management resources as well as negatively impact our consolidated results of operations.Our operating results fluctuate due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, and any of which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition.Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from our forecasts, targets, or projections because of a number of factors, including the following:•changes in average weekly net sales and comparable net bakery-cafe sales due to:•lower customer traffic or average check per transaction, including as a result of the introduction or removal of new menu items;•changes in demographics, consumer preferences, and discretionary spending;•negative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other problems at our bakery-cafes; and•seasonality, including as a result of inclement weather.•cost increases due to:•changes in our operating costs;•labor availability and increased labor costs, including wages of management and associates, compensation, insurance, and health care; and•changes in business strategy including concept evolution and new designs.•profitability of new bakery-cafes, especially in new markets;•delays in new bakery-cafe openings;•fluctuations in supply costs, shortages, or interruptions; and•natural disasters and other calamities.Increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.We expect our advertising expenses to continue to increase and to dedicate greater resources to advertising and marketing than in previous years. If new advertising and other marketing programs, including our national television advertising, do not drive increased net bakery-cafe sales or if the costs of advertising, media, or marketing increase greater than expected, our consolidated financial results could be materially adversely affected.Our federal, state, and local tax returns have been and may in the future be selected for audit by the taxing authorities, which may result in tax assessments or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.We are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United States and Canada, including sales, use, and other applicable taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if the Internal Revenue Service or another taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns, we could have additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.13A regional or global health pandemic could severely affect our business.A health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. If a regional or global health pandemic occurs, depending upon its duration, location, and severity, our business could be severely affected. Generally, we are viewed by our customers as an “everyday oasis”, a friendly, all day destination where people can gather with friends and business colleagues. Customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional, or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact our business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of ingredients and products in our supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in our bakery-cafes. The impact of a health pandemic might be disproportionately greater on us than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people for the sale of their products.Regional factors could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations.There are several states in which we, our franchisees, or both own and operate a significant number of bakery-cafes. As a result, the economic conditions, state and local laws, government regulations, and weather conditions affecting those particular states, or a geographic region generally, may have a material impact upon our consolidated results of operations.Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance would likely adversely affect the market price of our stock.The public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectations that our business would continue to grow and that we would achieve certain levels of financial performance. Should we fail to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to comparable net bakery-cafe sales revenues, operating margins, and diluted earnings per share, the market price of our stock would likely decline.ITEM 1B.
