Risk Factors We could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our significant customers or changes in their requirements for our products We are reliant upon sales to a few significant customers. Sales to Ford and GM were 32% of our overall revenue in 2006, while sales to Chrysler, PACCAR, Navistar, Renault-Nissan, Volvo Truck and Toyota in the aggregate accounted for another 30%. Changes in our business relationships with any of our large customers or in the timing, size and continuation of their various programs could have an adverse impact on us. The loss of any of these customers, the loss of business with respect to one or more of their vehicle models on which we have a high component content, or a further significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles would impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are continually bidding on new business with these customers, as well as seeking to diversify our customer base, but there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover portions of our high commodity costs (including costs of steel, other raw materials, and energy) from our customers For some time, high commodity costs have significantly impacted our earnings, as well as the results of others in our industry. As part of our reorganization initiatives, we are working with our customers to recover a greater portion of our commodity costs. While we have achieved some success in these efforts to date, there is no assurance that commodity costs will not continue to adversely impact our profitability. We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers We spend over $4,000 annually for purchased goods and services. To manage and reduce these costs, we have been consolidating our supply base. As a result, we are dependent on single sources of supply for some components of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that strong demand, capacity limitations or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and were unable to procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in timely fashion, which would adversely affect our revenues, margins and customer relations. 14 Table of Contents We may be unable to complete the divestiture of our non-core fluid products and pump products businesses as contemplated We announced plans to divest our fluid products and pump products businesses and classified them as discontinued operations in our financial statements in 2005. The abundance of assets currently available for sale in the light vehicle industry could affect our ability to complete these divestitures and/or impact the proceeds that we receive. Moreover, during our bankruptcy proceedings, there may be limitations on the terms and conditions that we can offer to potential purchasers of these operations. Failure to complete these strategic divestitures would place further pressure on our profitability and cash flow and would divert our focus from our core businesses. We may be unable to renegotiate expiring collective bargaining agreements with U.S. and Canadian unionized employees on satisfactory terms The achievement of our reorganization goals will depend in large part on the labor and benefits costs that we are able to reduce through negotiations with our U.S. and Canadian union organizations and through the bankruptcy process. There is no assurance that we will be able to reduce this significant part of our cost structure. In addition, our efforts to secure these cost savings could result in work stoppages by our unionized employees or similar disturbances which could disrupt our ability to meet our customersÂ’ supply requirements. We could be adversely affected by the costs of our asbestos-related product liability claims We have exposure to asbestos-related claims and litigation because some of our automotive products in the past contained asbestos. At the end of 2006, we had approximately 73,000 active pending asbestos-related product liability claims, including 6,000 that were settled and awaiting documentation and payment. A substantial increase in the costs to resolve these claims or changes in the amount of available insurance could adversely impact us, as could the enactment of U.S. federal legislation relating to asbestos personal injury claims. We could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental compliance Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that govern emissions to the air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Currently, environmental costs with respect to our former and existing operations are not material. However, there is no assurance that the costs of complying with current environmental laws and regulations, or those that may be adopted in the future, will not increase and adversely impact us.
