D: Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.” Company overview We are a leading manufacturer of high-quality engineered quartz surfaces sold under our premium Caesarstone brand. The substantial majority of our quartz surfaces are used as countertops in residential kitchens and sold primarily into the renovation and remodeling end markets. Other applications for our products include vanity tops, wall panels, back splashes, floor tiles, stairs and other interior surfaces that are used in a variety of residential and commercial applications. 41 Founded in 1987, Caesarstone is a pioneer in the engineered quartz surface industry. We have grown to become the largest provider of quartz surfaces in Australia, Canada, Israel, France and South Africa, and have significant market share in the United States and Singapore. Our products accounted for approximately 12% of global engineered quartz by volume in 2014. Our sales in the United States, Australia, Canada and Israel, our four largest markets, accounted for 41.5%, 24%, 12.9% and 9.2% of our revenues in 2014, respectively. We believe that our revenues will continue to be highly concentrated among a relatively small number of geographic regions for the foreseeable future. We have direct sales channels in the United States, Australia, Canada, Israel and Singapore. Since acquiring our U.S. distributor in May 2011, we now generate the substantial majority of our revenues in the United States from direct distribution of our products, including in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, where we commenced direct distribution in January 2012 and November 2012, respectively. In Australia, we distribute directly to fabricators, and in January 2012, we expanded our direct distribution to Southern and Western Australia thereby expanding our direct distribution to all of Australia. In Israel, we distribute our products directly to several local distributors who in turn sell to fabricators. In October 2010, we began selling our products in Eastern Canada through a joint venture in which we hold a 55% interest. We commenced selling our products through the joint venture in Western Canada in May 2011. In October 2011, following the acquisition of our former Singaporean distributor’s business, we began selling our products directly in Singapore. In our remaining markets, we distribute our products through third-party distributors. In each of these indirect markets, fabricators typically sell our products to end consumers, contractors, developers and builders who are generally advised by architects and designers regarding the use of our products. Our strategy is to generate demand from all groups in our product supply chain. Despite the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and continues to impact European markets, we experienced annual compound revenue growth of 11.5% from 2007 to 2009, 22.2% from 2009 to 2012, 20.2% from 2012 to 2013, and 25.5% from 2013 to 2014. Our growth from 2007 to 2012 was impacted significantly by the acquisition of the distribution channels in Australia, the United States and Canada, while 2013 and 2014 growth represented only organic growth. From 2007 to 2014, our gross profit margins improved from 27.4% to 42.4%, adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 18.4% to 26.1%, and adjusted net income increased from 9.2% to 18.4% over the same period. We attribute this sales and margin growth to the acquisition of the business of our former Australian and U.S. distributors, our transition to direct distribution in Canada, our penetration of new markets, increased operational efficiencies and a change in product mix towards an increased differentiated offering. Our strategy is to continue to be a global market leader in quartz surface products. We continue to invest in developing our premium brand worldwide and to further expand our differentiated product offering. We intend to continue to expand our sales network by further penetrating our existing markets as well as entering new markets. We believe that a significant portion of our future growth will come from continued penetration of our U.S. market, —particularly with the additional manufacturing capacity we intend to use as we begin operations at our facility in the State of Georgia in 2015—as well as from our markets in Australia and Canada. We believe our expansion into new markets that exhibit an existing demand for stone products and stone installation capabilities will contribute to our future growth in the long term. We believe there will be consolidation in the quartz surface industry in the future and to remain competitive in the long term, we will need to grow our business both organically and through the acquisition of third-party distributors, manufacturers and/or raw material suppliers. Our functional currency has been the U.S. dollar since July 1, 2012. Until June 30, 2012, our functional currency was the NIS and our reporting currency was the U.S. dollar. For a further discussion of the change of functional currency, see “ITEM 18: Financial Statements.” For the periods in which our functional currency was the NIS, the financial data presented in the following discussion has been translated into U.S. dollars using the method of conversion used to translate our financial statements, the current rate method. Factors impacting our results of operations We consider the following factors to be important in analyzing our results of operations: · Our sales are impacted by home renovation and remodeling and new residential, and to a lesser extent, commercial and construction spending trends. We estimate that approximately 60% of our revenue is related to renovation and remodeling activities in the United States, Australia and Canada, while 25% to 35% is related to housing starts. Spending in each of these sectors declined significantly in 2009 compared to 2008 in most of the markets in which we operate and, to date, many of these markets, including Europe, the United States, Australia and Canada, did not recover or recovered only to a certain degree. U.S. housing starts recovered, growing 81.6% from 2009 to 2014 but are still 25.5% below levels from 2007. Home renovation and remodeling spending is estimated to recover by 21.4% from its recent bottom in 2010 but is still 4.8% below its 2007 level according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies, Harvard University. In Australia, housing starts recovered completely from their 2009 low and reached a new peak after increasing 24.3% from July 2012 to July 2014, reversing an aggregate 16.3% decrease between July 2010 and June 2012. Home renovation and remodeling spending in Australia, however, were estimated to grow by only 0.3% from July 2013 to June 2014 and are still 8.5% below their 2008 peak. Housing starts in Canada were estimated to grow by only 0.7% in 2014 and are still 17.1% below 2007 level. Home renovation and remodeling spending in Canada is estimated to have grown 3.5% in 2014, but in that period was still approximately 12% below its 2007 peak, according to Scotiabank. Despite the 2007 to 2009 global downturn, prevailing weak economic conditions in Europe and mixed economic conditions in the United States, Australia and Canada as described above, we experienced compound annual revenue growth of 19.2% between 2007 and 2014 through increased penetration of quartz in kitchen countertop applications, market share gains in some of our key markets, and an increase in average selling prices associated with our establishment of new direct distribution channels and the expansion of our differentiated product offering. In 2013, our revenue increased in all regions, with the most significant growth in sales in the United States, growing by over 40% leveraging our increased distribution footprint, the successful introduction of the super natural collection, supported by a positive housing market. In 2014, our revenues increased in all regions except Israel. The most significant growth in sales occurred in the United States, where revenues increased by 50.4%, in part due to the continued quartz recognition, the collaboration with IKEA, improved product offerings, and a positive-trending housing market. Significant growth was achieved also in Australia and Canada, which grew 27.4% and 26.2%, respectively, on a constant currency basis. 42 · Our gross profit margins have improved significantly over recent years, with 42.4% margin in 2014, compared to 45.5% in 2013, 43.0% in 2012, and 40.2% in 2011. The primary reasons for these gross profit margin improvements from 2011 to 2014 were the improved product offerings associated with the introduction of our super natural products and the impact of scale benefits. In 2014, gross profit margins decreased mainly due to unfavorable exchange rates, increased IKEA business related to fabrication and installation activities, which comes with lower gross margin and a non-recurring $3.5 million credit to cost of revenues from 2013. · Our operating income margins were 16.8% in 2012, 21.3% in 2013, and 21.2% in 2014. The increase from 2012 to 2014 resulted primarily from economies of scale benefits on operating expenses that we started to leverage in 2013, mainly in the United States and Canada. Operating income margins remained substantially the same in 2014, but grew by 90 basis points excluding the 2013 non-recurring credit mentioned above. The improvement in operating income margin each year was achieved despite a significant negative impact from exchange rate fluctuations. · In 2005, we commenced operations with a third manufacturing line at a new manufacturing facility in the Bar-Lev Industrial Park in northern Israel. We subsequently established a fourth production line in 2007 with the addition of a second production line at our Bar-Lev manufacturing facility. The operation of the fifth production line in the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility included two phases and was completed in the second quarter of 2014. The first production line in the new U.S. facility is planned to be operational in the second quarter of 2015 and the second production line is planned to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our investments related to the fifth production line at our Bar-Lev manufacturing facility was $24 million and the investment related to the production capacity increase in the United States is estimated to be approximately $115 million. · As an increasing portion of our products are sold through direct channels, our revenues and results of operations exhibit some quarterly fluctuations as a result of seasonal influences which impact construction and renovation cycles. Due to the fact that certain of our operating costs are fixed, the impact on our adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and net income of a change in revenues is magnified. We believe that the third quarter tends to exhibit higher sales volumes than other quarters because demand for quartz surface products is generally higher during the summer months in the northern hemisphere with the effort to complete new construction and renovation projects before the new school year. Conversely, the first quarter is impacted by the winter slowdown in the northern hemisphere in the construction industry and depending on the date of the spring holiday in Israel in a particular year, the first or second quarter is impacted by a reduction in sales in Israel due to such holiday. Similarly, sales in Australia during the first quarter are negatively impacted by fewer construction and renovation projects. The fourth quarter is susceptible to being impacted from the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere. · We conduct business in multiple countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Australia and the Middle East and as a result, we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies in which we conduct business. A significant portion of our revenues is generated in U.S. and Australian dollars, and to a lesser extent the Canadian dollar, the euro and the new Israeli shekel. In 2014, 43.3% of our revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars, 24.0% in Australian dollars, 12.9% in Canadian dollars, 10.5% in euros and 9.2% in NIS. As a result, devaluations of the Australian dollars, and to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar may unfavorably impact our profitability. Our expenses are largely denominated in U.S. dollars, NIS and euro, with a smaller portion in the Australian dollars and Canadian dollars. As a result, appreciation of the NIS, and to a lesser extent, the euro relative to the U.S. dollar may unfavorably impact our profitability. We attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through forward and option contracts, which, except for USD/NIS forward contracts, are not designated as hedging accounting instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (originally issued as SFAS 133). As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding contracts with a notional amount of $98.6. These transactions were for a period of up to 12 months. The fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was $(0.4) million, which is included in current assets and current liabilities, at December 31, 2014. For further discussion of our foreign currency derivative contracts, see “ITEM 11: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” 43 Components of statements of income Revenues We derive our revenues from sales of quartz surfaces, mostly to fabricators in our direct markets and to third-party distributors in our indirect markets. In Australia (as of March 2008), Eastern Canada (as of October 2010), Western Canada (as of May 2011), the United States (as of May 2011) and Singapore (as of October 2011) the initial purchasers of our products are fabricators. Direct sales accounted for 86.6%, 87.0%, and 88.2% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. In Israel, the initial purchasers are local distributors who in turn sell to fabricators. In the United States, we also sell our products to a small number of sub-distributors, stone resellers and to IKEA. We consider Israel to be a direct market due to the warranty we provide to end-consumers, our local fabricator technical instruction programs and our robust local sales and marketing activities. The initial purchasers of our products in our other markets are our third-party distributors who in turn sell to sub-distributors and fabricators. We recognize revenues upon sales to an initial purchaser when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Delivery occurs when title is transferred under the applicable international commerce terms, or Incoterms, to the purchaser. The warranties that we provide vary by market. In our indirect markets, we provide all of our distributors with a limited direct manufacturing defect warranty. In all of our indirect markets, distributors are responsible for providing warranty coverage to end-customers. In Australia, Canada, the United States and Singapore, we provide end-consumers with a limited warranty on our products for interior countertop applications. In Israel, we typically provide end-consumers with a direct limited manufacturing defect warranty on our products. Based on historical experience, warranty issues are generally identified within one and a half years after the shipment of the product and a significant portion of defects are identified before installation. We record a reserve on account of possible warranty claims, which increases our cost of revenues. Historically, warranty claims have been low, accounting for approximately 0.4% of our total goods sold in 2014. The following table sets forth the geographic breakdown of our revenues during the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Geographical Region % total revenues Revenues in thousands of USD % of revenues Revenues in thousands of USD % total revenues Revenues in thousands of USD United States 41.5 % $ 185,583 34.6 % $ 123,399 29.2 % $ 86,759 Australia 24.0 107,539 25.2 89,894 30.0 88,935 Canada 12.9 57,898 13.8 49,214 13.6 40,322 Israel 9.2 41,286 11.8 42,024 12.3 36,373 Europe 5.2 23,109 6.4 22,973 7.0 20,749 Rest of world 7.2 31,987 8.2 29,050 7.9 23,426 Total 100.0 % 447,402 100.0 % 356,554 100.0 % 296,564 Revenues in the United States totaled $86.8 million in 2012, a 45.2% increase from 2011. It represents 21.3% of organic growth from executing our direct distribution strategy in this market, positive building industry trends, along with the benefits associated with operating for a full year following the acquisition of Caesarstone USA. U.S. revenues increased 42.2% in 2013, leveraging continued quartz conversion, successful introduction of our super natural collection, and positive housing trends. Our U.S. revenues saw an increase of 50.4% in 2014, despite a milder housing market improvement, leveraging continued quartz conversion, increased portion of our wider super natural collection along with a major growth in our business with IKEA, which also includes a significant portion of fabrication and installation component. In Australia, we were able to resume significant growth in 2014 after two prior years of only slight growth associated with a weak housing market. In 2014, revenue in Australia grew by 19.6%, 27.4% on a constant-currency-basis, as a result of our improved product offering (primarily super natural with our new Calacatta and Granite-inspired designs) and backed by housing market improvements. In Canada, we continued our strong growth. Revenue grew 17.6% in 2014, representing a 26.2% increase on a constant-currency-basis compared to 22.1% growth, 25.9% on a constant-currency-basis in 2013, leveraging increased quartz penetration, improved product offering with the super natural collection. This growth was backed by increased renovation activities, despite weaker housing starts. Compared to 2007 and 2008, our revenues in Europe in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 have declined and have not recovered since then, due to challenging macroeconomic conditions in Europe. In 2014, revenues in Israel declined by 1.8% due to a weak housing market. The rate of revenue growth in Israel is generally less than other regions given the significant and more longstanding penetration of quartz in Israel and our large market share. Our revenues for the rest of the world increased by 24.0% between 2012 and 2013, and continued growing in 2014 by 10.1%, due to our stronger presence in existing markets and our expansion into new markets. 44 We did not have any customer in 2012, 2013 and 2014 that accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. Some of our initial engagements with distributors are pursuant to an agreement or terms of sale, as applicable, granting that distributor one year of exclusivity in consideration for meeting minimum sales targets. After the initial one-year period, we may enter into a distribution agreement for a several-year period. However, in the majority of cases, we continue to operate on the basis of the agreement or terms of sale, or without any operative agreement. Some distributors operate on nonexclusive terms of sale agreements or entirely without agreements. In all cases, we only supply our products to distributors upon the receipt of a purchase order from the distributor. Cost of revenues and gross profit margin Approximately 48% of our cost of revenues is raw material costs. Our principal raw materials are quartz, polyester 74% of our total raw material cost. The balance of our cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing costs and related overhead. Cost of revenues in our direct distribution channels also includes the cost of delivery from our manufacturing facilities to our warehouses, warehouse operational costs, as well as additional delivery costs associated with the shipment of our products to customer sites in certain markets. In the case of our indirect distribution channels, we bear the cost of delivery to the Israeli seaport and our distributors bear the cost of delivery from the seaport to their warehouses. One of our principal raw materials, quartz, is acquired from quartz manufacturers primarily in Turkey, India, Portugal and Israel. Our products incorporate a number of types of quartz, including quartzite. We acquire quartzite from four suppliers in Turkey, with the major part acquired from Mikroman and Polat. Our current supply arrangements with Mikroman is based on a verbal agreement, while our arrangement with Polat is memorialized in an unsigned written draft letter agreement sent to Polat. We typically transact business with our other suppliers on an annual framework agreement basis, under which we execute purchase order from time to time. Prior to the manufacturing process, boulder quartz and processed crushed quartz must be processed into finer grades of fractions, granules and powder. Until January 2012, we received quartz processing services from our quartz suppliers and from Microgil, a third-party processor in Israel, although our quartz suppliers now exclusively perform this service for us. Quartz accounted for approximately 31% of our raw materials cost in 2014. Accordingly, our cost of sales and overall results of operations are impacted significantly by fluctuations in quartz prices. For example, if the cost of quartz was to rise by 10% and we were not able to pass along any of such increase to our customers or achieve other offsetting savings, we would experience a decrease of approximately 0.9% in our gross profit margin. We do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers of quartz. The price of quartz was relatively stable between 2011 and 2013, but in 2014 and 2015 we experienced increases of prices, and may experience additional increases in the future. Any future increases in quartz prices may adversely impact our margins and net income. We acquire polyester on a purchase order basis with several suppliers outside of Israel based on our projected needs for the subsequent one to three months. Given the significance of polyester costs relative to our total raw material expenditures, our cost of sales and overall results of operations are impacted significantly by fluctuations in their price, which generally correlates with oil prices and had fluctuated significantly between 2008 and 2011, but stabilized during 2012, 2013 and 2014 on a constant currency basis. If the price of polyester was to rise by 10%, and we were not able to pass along any of such increase to our customers or achieve other offsetting savings, we would realize a decrease of approximately 1.2% in our gross profit margins. We have found that increases in prices are difficult to pass on to our customers. The price of polyester had risen significantly from June 2009 through April 2011, although prices have subsequently declined moderately. 45 The gross profit margins on sales in our direct markets are generally higher than in our indirect markets in which we use third-party distributors, due to the elimination of the third-party distributor’s margin. In many markets, our expansion strategy is to work with third-party distributors who we believe will be able to increase sales more rapidly in their market than if we distributed our products directly. However, in several markets we distribute directly, including the United States, Australia and Canada. In the future, we intend to evaluate other potential markets to distribute directly. Research and development, net Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, as well as costs for subcontractor services and costs of materials consumed in connection with the design and development of our products. We expense all of our research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses were partially offset through 2013 by financing through grants from the OCS of the Ministry of Economy of the State of Israel. We recognized such participation grants at the time at which we were entitled to such grants on the basis of the costs incurred and included those grants as a deduction from research and development expenses. This OCS program ended during 2013. The Israeli law under which OCS grants were made requires royalty payments and limited our ability to manufacture products, or transfer technologies developed using these grants outside of Israel. If we were to seek approval to manufacture products, or transfer technologies developed using these grants, outside of Israel, we could be subject to additional royalty requirements or be required to pay certain redemption fees. If we were to violate these restrictions, we could be required to refund any grants previously received, together with interest and penalties, and may be subject to criminal charges. We believe the ongoing construction of a new production facility in the United States will not subject us to any royalty payment obligations or require us to refund any grants because our OCS grants financed our development of a product that has not been commercialized yet and are not planned to be manufactured at the U.S. production facility. In addition, based on OCS statements, we believe that our OCS funding is exempted from royalty payment obligations. Our development project operated under the OCS funding arrangement began in August 2009. We recognized OCS funding of $0.3 million in 2012 and $0.01 million in 2013. Marketing and selling Marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated costs for personnel engaged in sales, marketing, distribution and advertising and promotional expenses. As we had invested significantly in 2011 and 2012 in building our acquired direct distribution channels in the U.S. and Canadian markets, marketing and selling expenses in general, and advertising expenses in particular, increased in both absolute and percentage terms in both years, when we increase the number of sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities. In 2013 and 2014, our absolute spending increased but decreased as a percentage of revenues. General and administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated costs for personnel engaged in finance, human resources, information technology, legal and other administrative activities, as well as fees for legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses also included management fees paid, until the IPO, to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam in the amount of $0.5 million in 2012, and to Tene in the amount of $0.2 million in 2012. The management service agreement expired in March 2012 following our IPO. See “—Other factors impacting our results of operations—Agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam” and “ITEM 7: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions.” We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase our direct distribution operations in the United States and Canada, incur additional costs related to the growth of our business, open a production facility in the United States, generate expenses related to maintaining and improving further our ERP system and incur legal expenses associated with our open lawsuits. Finance expenses, net Finance expenses, net, consist primarily of borrowing costs, losses on derivative instruments and exchange rate differences arising from changes in the value of monetary assets and monetary liabilities stated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity. These expenses are partially offset by interest income on our cash balances and gains on derivative instruments. Our bank interest expenses have decreased since 2011 as we paid our commercial debt, while our bank charges increased due to our increased business volume. Interest income increased as we accumulated cash generated by our March 2012 IPO and on-going cash flow and decreased in 2014 given our reduced deposit balances, our increased capital expenditures and the 2013 dividend payout. However, the main reason for the year-over-year reduction in finance expenses between 2011 and 2014 was the reduction in expenses related to foreign exchange rates as our exchange rates trended favorably in 2011 relative to 2010, were relatively neutral in 2012 and trended significantly unfavorably during 2013, with our derivatives generated an offsetting impact. 46 Corporate taxes As we operate in a number of countries, our income is subject to taxation in different jurisdictions with a range of tax rates. Our effective tax rate was 14.5% in 2012, 13.8% in 2013, and 14.6% in 2014. The standard corporate tax rate for Israeli companies was 25% in 2012 and 2013 and increased to 26.5% in 2014 onward. Our non-Israeli subsidiaries are taxed according to the tax laws in their respective country of organization. Effective January 1, 2011, with the enactment of Amendment No. 68 to the Israeli Tax Law, both of our Israeli facilities operate under a consolidated “Preferred Enterprise” status. The “Preferred Enterprise” status provides the portion related to the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility with the potential to be eligible for grants of up to 20% of the investment value in approved assets and a reduced flat corporate tax rate, which applies to the industrial enterprise’s entire preferred income, as follows: 2011-2012—10%, 2013-2014—7%, and 2015 and thereafter—6%. Subsequently, on August 5, 2013, the 2014 and onwards tax bracket was increased by the Knesset to 9%. For the portion related to the Kibbutz Sdot-Yam facility, this status provides us with a reduced flat corporate tax rate, which applies to the industrial enterprise’s entire preferred income, as follows: 2011-2012—15%, 2013-2014—12.5%, and 2015 and onwards—12%. Subsequently, on August 5, 2013, the 2014 and onwards tax bracket was increased by the Knesset to 16%. For more information about the tax benefits available to us as an Approved Enterprise or as a Beneficiary Enterprise or as Preferred Enterprise, see “ITEM 10.E: Additional Information—Taxation—Israeli tax considerations and government programs.” We have entered into a transfer pricing arrangement that establishes transfer prices for our inter-company operations. Because of our multi-jurisdictional operations, we apply significant judgment to determine our consolidated income tax position. We estimate our effective tax rate for the coming years based on our planned future financial results in existing and new markets and the key factors affecting our tax liability, particularly our transfer pricing policy. Accordingly, we estimate that our effective tax rate will range between 16% and 20% of our income before income tax in 2015, increasing further in 2016, when we expect to conduct significant manufacturing operations in the United States. In the long-term, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will further increase as the portion of our income attributed to the United States manufacturing and to the distribution subsidiaries grows. We cannot provide any assurance that our plans will be realized and that our assumptions with regard to the key elements affecting tax rates will be accepted by the tax authorities. Therefore, our actual effective tax rate may be higher than our estimate. Equity in losses of affiliate, net In January 2007, we acquired a 25% equity interest in our U.S. distributor, Caesarstone USA. We accounted for this investment using the equity method. Consequently, the results of operations of the distributor directly impacted our net income during the period we accounted for this investment using the equity method. We did not record any equity income or losses beginning May 18, 2011 as a result of our acquisition of Caesarstone USA on such date. The results of operations and financial position of Caesarstone USA have been fully consolidated in our financial statements since May 18, 2011. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest In October 2010, we closed a transaction for the establishment of a joint venture with our former third-party distributor in Eastern Canada, Canadian Quartz Holdings Inc. (“Ciot”). Ciot acquired a 45% ownership interest in the new subsidiary, Caesarstone Canada Inc., and 45% of Caesarstone Canada Inc.’s net income is attributed to Ciot. Other factors impacting our results of operations Payment of compensation and grant of options upon the pricing of the IPO We paid the following amounts immediately following our IPO in March 2012: (1) $3.0 million to our Chief Executive Officer in connection with 350,000 of our shares granted to him in January 2009 with 175,000 exercised in October 2011 and 175,000 shares automatically exercised upon the closing of the IPO based on the increase in value of our company at the date of the IPO (see “ITEM 6.B: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Compensation of Officers and Directors”), and (2) $1.72 million to certain of our employees and $0.25 million to our Chairman for their contribution to our success. The $1.72 million and $0.25 million amounts were recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2012 when the offering closed. 47 In addition, following the IPO in March 2012, we granted certain of our key employees, including our executive officers, options to purchase 1,505,200 ordinary shares with an exercise price equal to the IPO price per share of $11.00 and additional options to purchase 40,000 ordinary shares with an exercise price of $15.84. We recorded share-based compensation expenses related to this grant of $1.2 million in 2014, $2.5 million in 2013, $3.7 million in 2012 and will record $0.4 over approximately the following year from January 2015. Agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam We are party to a series of agreements with our largest shareholder, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, which govern different aspects of our relationship. Pursuant to these agreements, in consideration for using facilities leased to us or for services provided by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, we paid to the Kibbutz an aggregate of $12.2 in 2014, $10.8 million in 2013, and $10.3 million in 2012 (excludes VAT). The increase in the amount paid in 2014 is mainly as a result of payments timing. Certain of our prior agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam were terminated in March 2012 and, other than with respect to our former management services agreement, which was not renewed, a new set of agreements became effective in March 2012. The new agreements provide for similar services to those that were previously provided to us by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, except that following the closing of our IPO as disclosed in “ITEM 7: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Relationship and agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam—Land purchase agreement and leaseback”, we agreed to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam acquiring from us our rights in the lands and facilities of the Bar-Lev Industrial Center, (the “Bar-Lev Grounds”) in consideration for NIS 43.7 million ($10.9). Following the completion of the transfer in September 2012, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam agreed to permit us to use the Bar-Lev Grounds for a period of ten years thereafter. Our right to use the Bar-Lev Grounds will be automatically renewed unless we give two years prior notice, for a ten-year term in consideration for an annual fee of NIS 4.1 million ($1.2) to be linked to increases in the Israeli consumer price index, which may be updated by an appraiser. See “ITEM 7.B: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions.” The new agreements entered into with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam along with the IPO resulted in an overall reduction of approximately $3.0 million in payments to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and Tene in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily as a result of the elimination of the management fee. Operating income was impacted by an additional approximately $0.2 million due to the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility sale-leaseback arrangement, which was accounted for as a financing arrangement, generating approximately $0.2 million in annual interest expense in 2012, which was applicable only with respect to a four-month period. Interest expense related to this agreement was $0.7 million each year in 2013 and 2014. In addition, in 2012, we committed to fund the cost of the construction, up to a maximum of NIS 3.3 million ($0.8) plus value added tax (VAT), required to change the access road leading to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and our facilities, such that the entrance to our facilities will be separated from the entrance into Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. The current rate of VAT in Israel is 18%. Comparison of period-to-period results of operations The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue (in thousands of U.S. dollars) Consolidated Income Statement Data: Revenues: $ 447,402 100.0 % $ 356,554 100.0 % $ 296,564 100.0 % Cost of revenues 257,751 57.6 194,436 54.5 169,169 57.0 Gross profit 189,651 42.4 162,118 45.5 127,395 43.0 Operating expenses: Research and development, net(1) 2,628 0.6 2,002 0.6 2,100 0.7 Marketing and selling 55,870 12.5 51,209 14.4 46,911 15.8 General and administrative 36,111 8.1 32,904 9.2 28,423 9.6 Total operating expenses 94,609 21.2 86,115 24.2 77,434 26.1 Operating income 95,042 21.2 76,003 21.3 49,961 16.9 Finance expenses, net 1,045 0.2 1,314 0.4 2,773 1.0 Income before taxes on income 93,997 21.0 74,689 20.9 47,188 15.9 Taxes on income 13,738 3.1 10,336 2.9 6,821 2.3 Income after taxes on income 80,259 17.9 64,353 18.0 40,367 13.6 Net income $ 80,259 17.9 % $ 64,353 18.0 % $ 40,367 13.6 % Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 1,820 0.4 1,009 0.2 735 0.2 Net income attributable to controlling interest $ 78,439 17.5 % $ 63,344 17.8 % $ 39,632 13.4 % 48 Year ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013 Revenues Revenues increased by $90.8 million, or 25.5%, to $447.4 million in 2014 from $356.6 million in 2013. The increase in revenues resulted from an approximately 15% increase in volume of sales, most notably in the United States, Australia, Canada and the rest of the world, along with increased average selling prices and considerable growth in business from IKEA, which includes a significant component of revenues derived from installation and fabrication. Higher average selling prices were attributable to the introduction of more differentiated products, including the new Calacatta and Granite-inspired designs, continued leverage of the super natural design, and selective regional price increases. All those factors were partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates, primarily related to a weakening of the Australian and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew by $101.4 million in 2014, an increase of 28.4% from 2013. Our revenues increased in 2014 in all regions except Israel. The most significant growth in sales occurred in the United States, where revenues increased by 50.4%, in part due to continued quartz recognition, our collaboration with IKEA, improved product offerings, and a positive-trending housing market. Significant growth also occurred in Australia and Canada where sales increased by 27.4% and 26.2%, respectively, on a constant currency basis. Cost of revenues and gross profit margins Cost of revenues increased by $63.3 million, or 32.6%, to $257.8 million in 2014 from $194.4 million in 2013. Cost of revenues in 2014 included a non-recurring unfavorable provision adjustment related to retroactive taxable employee fringe benefits. This adjustment increased our cost of revenues by $0.8 million. Cost of revenues in 2013 included a one-time credit of $3.5 million related to inventory adjustment. Beyond the adjustment noted above, cost of revenues increased primarily due to volume increases and, to a lesser extent, due to the IKEA installation and fabrication component. Also contributing to the increased cost of revenues were the elevated production levels of our differentiated super natural collection, which, despite incurring a premium in price from consumers, carries higher manufacturing costs, and an increase in quartz raw material prices. Gross margin decreased by 190 basis points in 2014, excluding the above-mentioned non-recurring items. The margin decrease was driven primarily by a negative exchange rate impact and increased business with IKEA, which brings lower gross margins due to the installation and fabrication component. These factors were partially offset by a positive differentiated product mix and scale benefits. Operating expenses Research and development, net. Research and development expenses, net of grants received during prior years, increased by $0.6 million, or 31.3%, to $2.6 million in 2014 from $2.0 million in 2013. The increase was mainly driven by accelerated development activities, increased depreciation costs, expenses related to share-based rights granted during 2014. Marketing and selling. Marketing and selling expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 9.1%, to $55.9 million in 2014 from $51.2 million in 2013. This increase resulted primarily from the need to support our growing business in the United States. During 2014 we grew our marketing and sales organization by 45 employees globally, primarily in the United States. We also increased our direct advertising and promotion activities in 2014. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million, or 9.7%, to $36.1 million in 2014 from $32.9 million in 2013. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in our operations in the United States, higher legal expenses related to our ongoing litigation and, to a lesser extent, growing audit fees mainly related to compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and an increase in expenses related to our ERP support and improvement activities. 49 Finance expenses, net Finance expenses, net decreased by $0.3 million, or 20.2% to $1.0 million in 2014 from $1.3 million in 2013. This decrease resulted primarily from higher net income related to the impact of exchange rates on our derivatives and net monetary assets and liabilities re-valuation, given that unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations were higher in 2014 than in 2013. Lower interest expenses were offset by lower interest income given our reduced bank deposit levels. Taxes on income Taxes on income increased by $3.4 million to $13.7 million in 2014 from $10.3 million in 2013, primarily as a result of $19.3 million increase in income before taxes compared with that in 2013. The effective tax rate increased from 13.8% of income before taxes in 2013 to 14.6% in 2013, given the increased tax rates associated with our “Preferred Enterprise” status. See “—Components of our statements of income—Corporate taxes” above. Those local tax rates went up in 2014 compare to 2013 from 12.5% to 16% on income generated by the Sdot-Yam facility and from 7% to 9% on income generated by the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest Net income attributable to non-controlling interest increased by $0.8 million from $1.0 million in 2013 to $1.8 million in 2014. This increase was due to higher income generated by Caesarstone Canada Inc. in 2014 compared to 2013 given its revenue growth. Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012 Revenues Revenues increased by $60.0 million, or 20.2%, to $356.6 million in 2013 from $296.6 million in 2012. The increase in revenues primarily resulted from a 14.9% increase in volume of sales, most notably in the United States, Canada and the rest of the world. The introduction of our new super natural designs in late 2012 in Australia, Israel and Canada and in March 2013 in the United States, along with favorable customer mix, significantly improved average selling prices, which was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates, primarily related to a weakening of the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew by $63.9 million in 2013, a growth of 21.6%. In 2013, our revenue increased in all regions, with the most significant growth in sales in the United States, which increased by over 40% leveraging our increased distribution footprint, the successful introduction of the super natural collection, supported by a positive housing market. Cost of revenues and gross profit margins Cost of revenues increased by $25.3 million, or 14.9%, to $194.4 million in 2013 from $169.2 million in 2012. Cost of revenues included a one-time positive inventory adjustment that reduced our cost of revenues by $3.5 million (See ITEM 5: "Application of critical accounting policies and estimates—Inventory valuation"). Cost of revenues increased primarily due to volume increases. Other factors that contributed to the increase include unfavorable exchange rates, related to the strengthening of the NIS and the Euro against the U.S. dollar and unit cost increase, driven by raw material price increase and product mix. Gross margin increased in 2013 to 45.5% from 43.0% in 2012. Excluding the one-time positive inventory adjustment, gross margin was 44.5%. The margin improvement was achieved primarily due to increased average selling price, related to the super natural designs and due to scale benefits. This was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates, most notably the weakening of the Australian and Canadian dollar and the strengthening of the NIS against the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses Research and development, net. Research and development expenses, net of grants received, decreased by $0.1 million, or 4.7%, to $2.0 million in 2013 from $2.1 million in 2012. The decrease was mainly due to our efficiency improvement program to realign functions between our research and development department and our operations department partially offset by decreased OCS grants, which amounted to $0.01 million in 2013 compared to $0.31 million in 2012. 50 Marketing and selling. Marketing and selling expenses increased by $4.3 million, or 9.2%, to $51.2 million in 2013 from $46.9 million in 2012. This increase resulted primarily from the need to support a growing business, especially in North America, and from marketing and selling expenses incurred by us as a result of our expanded direct distribution operations in the mid-West and Phoenix regions of the United States. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $4.5 million, or 15.8%, to $32.9 million in 2013 from $28.4 million in 2012. This increase was driven by primarily by higher labor cost related to an increase of 31 employees worldwide and the follow-on offering related expenses of $1.3 million. Other increases resulted from the implementation costs of our ERP system, bad debt provisions and the cost of operating as a public company. Finance expenses, net Finance expenses, net decreased by 52.6% to $1.3 million in 2013 from $2.8 million in 2012. This decrease resulted primarily from net foreign exchange income, related to gains on our derivatives given the unfavorable exchange rates fluctuations during 2013, mainly in the Australian dollar. Our interest expenses and bank charges, net increased by $0.3 million. Despite the increase in our net cash balance due to the introduction of interest expense on the 2012 sale lease back arrangement at the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility and increased volume-related bank charges. Taxes on income Taxes on income increased by $3.5 million to $10.3 million in 2013 from $6.8 million in 2012, primarily as a result of an increase of $27.5 million in income before taxes compared with 2012. The effective tax rate applicable to us dropped from 14.5% of income before taxes in 2012 to 13.8% in 2013, given the lower local Israeli tax rates associated with our “Preferred Enterprise” status. Those local tax rates went down from 15% in 2012 to 12.5% in 2013, as applied to income generated by the Sdot-Yam facility, and from 10% in 2012 to 7% in 2013, as applied to income generated by the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility. The decreased rates of taxable income were offset by higher income attributable to our subsidiaries, which are located in jurisdictions where tax rates are higher, and a $0.6 million deferred tax liability adjustment associated with a newly levied increase in our Israeli tax rate. Beginning in 2014, this deferred tax liability adjustment comprises a 16% increase in local taxes on income generated by the Sdot-Yam facility and a 9% increase in local taxes on income generated by the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest Net income attributable to non-controlling interest increased by $0.3 million from $0.7 million in 2012 to $1.0 million in 2013. This increase was due to higher income generated by Caesarstone Canada Inc. in 2013 compared to 2012.

(f) Relates to a refund of Israeli VAT associated with a bad debt from 2007. (g) Relates to an adjustment in taxes as a result of a tax settlement we reached with Israeli tax authorities. Our results of operations are impacted by seasonal factors, including construction and renovation cycles. We believe that the third quarter of the year exhibits higher sales volumes than other quarters because demand for quartz surface products is generally higher during the summer months in the northern hemisphere, when the weather is more favorable for new construction and renovation projects, as well as the impact of efforts to complete such projects before the beginning of the new school year. Conversely, the first quarter is impacted by a slowdown in new construction and renovation projects during the winter months as a result of adverse weather conditions in the northern hemisphere and, depending on the date of the spring holiday in Israel in a particular year, the first or second quarter is impacted by a reduction in sales in Israel due to such holiday. Similarly, sales in Australia during the first quarter are negatively impacted due to fewer construction and renovation projects. We expect that seasonal factors will have a greater impact on our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income attributable to controlling interest in the future due to our recent shift to direct distribution in the United States and Canada, and as we continue to increase direct distribution as a percentage of our total revenues in the future. This is because we generate higher average selling prices in the markets in which we have direct distribution channels and, therefore, our revenues are more greatly impacted by changes in demand in these markets. At the same time, our fixed costs have also increased as a result of our shift to direct distribution and, therefore, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on our revenues on our profit margins, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income will likely be magnified in future periods. In 2014, sales volume increased by 15.3% from the first quarter to the second quarter and by 4.1% from the second quarter to the third quarter. 2014 fourth quarter volume was 5.4% below that of the third quarter. In 2013, sales volume increased by 13.5% from the first quarter to the second quarter and by 6.8% from the second quarter to the third quarter. 2013 fourth quarter volume was similar to the third quarter of 2013, despite seasonality, due to our ability to fully close on pent-up delivery backlog, which was created in connection with the change of our ERP system. We expect in the future that our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income attributable to controlling interest will correlate with sales volume and will be highest in the third quarter and lowest in the third quarter, as indicated by the quarterly results for 2014 and 2013, shown above. 54 Application of critical accounting policies and estimates Our accounting policies affecting our financial condition and results of operations are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, included in this annual report. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates upon various factors, including past experience, where applicable, external sources and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and could have a material adverse effect on our reported results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction, event or activity is specifically dictated by accounting principles and does not require management’s judgment in its application, while in other cases, management’s judgment is required in the selection of the most appropriate alternative among the available accounting principles, that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to our financial results and to the understanding of our past and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s estimates and assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making our estimate; and (2) changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our trade receivables are derived from sales to customers located mainly in the United States, Australia, Canada, Israel and Europe. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and to date have not experienced any material losses. In certain circumstances, we may require letters of credit or prepayments. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments that we have determined to be doubtful of collection. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customers’ receivables, considering customers’ financial condition, credit history and other current economic conditions. If a customer’s financial condition were to deteriorate which might impact its ability to make payment, then additional allowances may be required. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 million, $1.9 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Inventory valuation The majority of our inventory consists of finished goods and substantially all of the balance consists of raw materials. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost of finished goods determined on the basis of direct manufacturing costs plus allocable indirect costs representing allocable operating overhead expenses and manufacturing costs and cost of raw materials determined using the “standard cost” method. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for different finished goods and raw material categories based on their quality classes and aging. If we consider specific inventory to be obsolete, we write such inventory down to zero. Inventory write-offs are provided to cover risks arising from slow-moving items, discontinued products, excess inventories and market prices lower than cost. The process for evaluating these write-offs often requires us to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning prices at which such inventory will be able to be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed of or sold. Inventory provision was $5.8 million, $6.3 million and $7.7 million as of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. In the second quarter of 2013, following the implementation of a new ERP system, we refined our method of finished goods costing based on the ERP system's ability to create in enhanced and refined bill of materials for each stock keeping unit. This resulted in more accurate value for each finish goods or work-in-process product held in inventory. The refinement provided by the new system gave us a more complete matching of inventory costs incurred with cost of revenues. This refinement resulted in a change of estimate for the value of inventory amounted to $3.5 million reducing our cost of revenues in the same amount. Goodwill and other long-lived assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets in the acquisition. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other,” we do not amortize goodwill, but test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value and carrying value of our reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise). We have only one reporting unit, and we determine its fair value based on our market capitalization. Goodwill was tested for impairment by comparing its fair market value with its carrying value. As of December 31, 2014, no impairment losses had been identified. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would then calculate the implied fair value of goodwill as compared to its carrying value to determine the appropriate impairment charge. 55 We operate in one operating segment that has five reporting components: Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd. (the Israeli parent company), our subsidiary in Australia, our subsidiary in the United States, our subsidiary in Canada (a joint venture in which we have a 55% interest) and Singapore. Each component of the single operating segment is engaged in selling and marketing our products. The goodwill that we have recorded with respect to our reporting unit relates to the acquisition of the business of our former Australian distributor in March 2008, the joint venture with Ciot, our former Eastern Canada third-party distributor, in October 2010 the acquisitions of our former Western Canada distributor’s business and Caesarstone USA in May 2011, and the acquisition of the business of our former Singapore distributor in October 2011. The goodwill associated with Caesarstone Canada Inc. was generated from our Canadian business combination with the former distributor in Eastern Canada during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the acquisition of the business of our former distributor in Western Canada in May 2011. Each component could be considered to be a reporting unit, however, we have concluded that all of our components should be deemed a single reporting unit for the purpose of performing the goodwill impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-35 because they have similar economic characteristic. There was no impairment of goodwill during any period presented. We also evaluate the carrying value of all long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment.” We will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. In determining whether long-lived assets are recoverable, our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of an asset is based upon our experience, historical operations of the asset, an estimate of future asset profitability and economic conditions. The future estimates of asset profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth, inflation and the overall economics of the countertop industry. Our estimates are subject to variability as future results can be difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be non-recoverable, we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value. During all periods presented no impairment losses were identified. Fair value measurements The performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell or transfer such an asset or liability. Selection of the appropriate valuation techniques, as well as determination of assumptions, risks and estimates used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability requires significant judgment. Although we believe that the inputs used in our evaluation techniques are reasonable, a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value for example, of certain assets and certain liabilities and could have an impact on both our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. Business combinations In accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations,” we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. In allocating the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we developed the required assumptions underlying the valuation work. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and distribution agreements, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Management estimated the fair values with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 75% equity interest in Caesarstone USA, our acquisition of the business of our former Western Canada distributor and our acquisition of the business of our former Singapore distributor. See Note 1b and 1c to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information regarding the purchase price allocation for these acquisitions. Accounting for contingencies We are subject to contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business that cover a wide range of matters, including, in particular, product liability. We are required to provide accruals for direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of such contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. Future results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control. 56 Income taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (formerly FIN48), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Our assumptions regarding future realization may change due to future operating performance and other factors. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The guidance requires that companies recognize in their consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is not more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax expenses. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws. As part of the determination of our tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with ASC 740 guidelines. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, new tax legislation, or the change of an estimate based on new information. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. We file income tax returns in Australia, Canada, Israel, Singapore and the United States. The Israeli tax authorities audited our income tax returns for the fiscal years leading up to and including 2011. We may therefore only be subject to examination by the Israel tax authorities for income tax returns filed for the 2012 fiscal year and any subsequent years. Management’s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income tax is calculated based on our assumptions as to our entitlement to various benefits under the applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The entitlement to such benefits depends upon our compliance with the terms and conditions set out in these laws. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and that we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in estimating our tax outcome, there is no assurance that the final tax outcome will not be different than those which are reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income and cash balances in the period in which such determination is made. Share-based compensation We apply ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Based Compensation” (ASC 718), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based payment awards made to our employees, including employee stock options which we started to grant following the IPO. Stock-based compensation expense associated with employee stock options in 2014 and 2013 was $1.4 and $2.5 million, respectively. Under ASC 718, we estimate the value of employee stock options as of date of grant using a Black & Scholes-based option valuation model. The determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant is affected by several factors including our stock price, our stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, expected dividends and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If such factors change and we employ different assumptions for future grants, our compensation expense may differ significantly from the amounts that we have recorded in the past. In addition, our compensation expense is affected by our estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. In addition, we have made share-based awards in the past that are considered liability awards and have required the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimates of fair values in accordance with ASC 718 (formerly: SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”). We determined the fair value of each award at the end of each fiscal quarter and recognized any change in value in our income statement. The determination of the fair value of these awards requires the use of subjective assumptions. 57 In January 2009, we granted our current Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) the right to a bonus payment based on the increase in our company’s value pursuant to which the CEO is entitled to receive in cash the difference between $4.60 per share, subject to adjustment for dividend distributions before payment of the bonus, and the value of 685,000 of our outstanding shares with such bonus right vesting over a three-year period in increments of 1/12 on a quarterly basis. However, upon the occurrence of an “exercise event,” the entire award, or any part thereof that was not previously exercised, fully vests immediately and the CEO is required to exercise his right to receive the cash value of the award. There were four defined “exercise events” under the award, including an IPO. The value of the rights upon an exercise event depends on the value ascribed to us in such transaction. If the right to the bonus was exercised upon an IPO, the bonus was to be calculated based on the difference between $4.60 per share, subject to adjustment for dividend distributions declared before the offering, and the IPO price. In the absence of an exercise event, the terms of the rights themselves state that our value is to be based on a 6.5 multiple of our EBITDA (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) less net debt (the “SBC EBITDA”) over four consecutive quarters, two preceding the exercise notice and two following it, minus net debt as of the end of the last quarter. In September 2010, our CEO notified us of his decision to exercise his right to receive an award bonus with respect to 335,000 vested shares calculated based on our SBC EBITDA. The award bonus amount relating to the 335,000 shares exercised was calculated based on our SBC EBITDA for 2010 and totaled $2.8 million, which we paid in June 2011. In October 2011, our CEO notified us of his decision to exercise his right to receive an award bonus with respect to a further 175,000 vested shares. The calculation of the award bonus amount was based on SBC EBITDA for 2011. The award bonus was paid on April 1, 2012 and totaled $1.5 million.In order to determine the fair value of the unexercised award at December 31, 2011, we determined that the probability of an IPO remained at 85% and estimated our enterprise value using multiplies of EBITDA and an IPO discount based on discussions regarding market conditions that we had with our underwriters. The fair value of the award upon a non-exercise event (e.g., remaining private) was determined using the SBC EBITDA multiple set forth in the award agreement. Based on these considerations, we determined that the fair value of the award for the unexercised 175,000 shares was $1.9 million and, when added to the amount accrued for the 175,000 exercised shares, the total accrual was $3.7 million at December 31, 2011. Based on the IPO price of $11.00, we made a payment of $1.5 million to our CEO in connection with the automatic exercise of the award in April 1, 2012. Phantom share-based payment During 2014, we granted several of our employees a right to a bonus payment based on an increase in our ordinary share value (the “phantom award”) and under which the employees are entitled to receive in cash or shares, in our discretion, the difference between exercise price, subject to adjustments for dividend distributions made until the actual payment of the bonus and the value of our ordinary shares with such bonus right vesting over a four-year period on an annual basis. According to ASC 718-10, “instruments that are required to be cash-settled (e.g., cash-settled stock appreciation rights) or require cash settlement on the occurrence of a contingent event that is considered probable” should be treated as a liability. As such, in this case, the share-based compensation is accounted for as a liability award. According to ASC 718-10, in connection with the measurement of the liability settlement, the value of the award should be measured each reporting date until settlement. The fair value of the phantom award was calculated using the Binominal option pricing model. After implementing the above accounting treatment, the liability balance that we recorded as of December 31, 2014 was $1.6 million. As of December 31, 2014, there was $2.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the phantom award. As of December 31, 2014, we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the binominal option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: December 31, 2014 Dividend yield 0.0 % Expected volatility 45.0 % Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % Expected life (in years) 6.3 B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary capital requirements have been to fund production capacity expansions, as well as investments in and acquisitions of third-party distributors, such as our acquisition of the business of our former Australian distributor, our investment in and acquisition of Caesarstone USA, formerly known as U.S. Quartz Products, Inc and the construction of our new manufacturing facility in the United States. Our other capital requirements have been to fund our working capital needs, operating costs, meet required debt payments and to pay dividends on our capital stock. 58 Capital resources have primarily consisted of cash flows from operations, cash generated from the March 2012 IPO, proceeds from the Bar-Lev sell and lease back arrangement and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, raw material costs and shipping costs. Our inventory strategy is to maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet anticipated customer demand for our products. Our inventory is significantly impacted by sales in the United States, Australia and Canada, our largest markets, due to the 40-60 days required to ship our products to these locations. In addition, our establishment of direct distribution channels has impacted our inventory. In September 2010, we signed an agreement to establish a joint venture, Caesarstone Canada Inc., with our third-party distributor in Eastern Canada, Ciot. In May 2011, we executed an agreement to purchase the remaining 75% equity interest in Caesarstone USA. Our inventory level increased by $3.0 million due to the purchase of Ciot’s inventory by Caesarstone Canada Inc. during 2010, with proceeds from shareholder loans. Our inventory level increased by $12.7 million as a result of our purchase of Caesarstone USA’s inventory and Caesarstone Canada Inc.’s purchase of the inventory of our former third-party distributor in Western Canada, during 2011. We continue to focus on meeting market demand for our products while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by implementing procedures to improve our production planning process. We minimize working capital requirements through our distribution network that allows sales and marketing activities to be provided by third-party distributors. We believe that, based on our current business plan, our cash, cash equivalents and short term bank deposits on hand, cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit line and short-term facilities, we will be able to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. We may require additional capital to meet our longer term liquidity and future growth requirements. Continued instability in the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business and would affect the cost and terms of such capital. Cash flows The following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented: As of December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 76,024 $ 75,670 $ 35,270 Net cash used in investing activities (27,726 ) (54,077 ) (58,180 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (26,671 ) (26,424 ) 42,480 Cash provided by operating activities Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and deferred taxes. In addition, operating cash flows are impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013, despite growth of $15.9 million in net income, mainly as a result of inventory increase of $22.3 million during 2014 compared to $7.3 million in 2013. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $40.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of a $24.0 million increase in net income and a $5.8 million increase in accrued expenses compared to a decrease of $9.9 million in 2012. 59 Cash used in investing activities In 2014, 2013 and 2012, our capital expenditures in cash totaled $86.4 million, $27.4 million, and $13.5 million, respectively. Capital expenditures from 2014 related primarily to our capacity expansion projects, with the majority invested in the new U.S. production facility and a much smaller portion going toward the completion of the fifth production line at our Bar-Lev facility in Israel. Capital expenditures in 2013 included $14.9 million for the construction of the fifth line in Bar-Lev and $3.6 million for the construction of the new manufacturing facility in the United States. Capital expenditures from 2012 related primarily to maintenance capital expenditures and did not include the addition of any new production lines. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $27.7, $54.1 million, and $58.2 million, respectively. In 2014, our cash used in investing activities was $27.7 million, consisting principally of $86.4 million of capital expenditures offset by $58.0 million of bank deposits converted to cash. In 2013, our cash used in investing activities was $54.1 million, consisting primarily of $26.3 million of cash converted to bank deposits and $27.4 million of capital expenditures. In 2012, our cash used in investing activities was $58.2 million, consisting primarily of $43.7 million of cash converted to bank deposits and $13.5 million of capital expenditures. The majority of our investment activities have historically been related to the purchase of manufacturing equipment and components for our production lines, as well as acquisitions of businesses, including our former Australian distributor and our Caesarstone USA acquisition. In order to support our overall business expansion, we will continue to invest in manufacturing equipment and components for our production lines. Moreover, we may spend additional amounts of cash on acquisitions from time to time, if and when such opportunities arise. On October 15, 2010, we closed an agreement to establish a joint venture, Caesarstone Canada Inc., with our former distributor in Eastern Canada. In connection with the formation of the joint venture, we granted Ciot a put option and Ciot granted us a call option for its interest, each exercisable any time between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2023. Exercise of the put option requires six months prior notice. Exercise of the call option does not require prior notice. The purchase price following such an exercise is to be determined in accordance with the call and put formulas, which are based on multiples that are subject to change based on the number of slabs sold and adjustments related to changes in price per slab for Caesarstone Canada Inc. The put option may only be exercised for at least $5 million plus an additional amount equal to interest at a yearly rate of 3.75%. The exercise of the put or call option would result in an increase in our ownership interest from 55% to 100%. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 was $26.7 million, which included a $20.0 million dividend to our shareholders in December 2014, $5.5 million of net loan repayments and $1.2 million of repayment of a financing leaseback arrangement related to our Bar-Lev facility, as described in “—Land purchase agreement and leaseback.” Net cash used in financing activities for 2013 was $26.5 million, which included a $20.1 million dividend to our shareholders in December 2013, $5.2 million of net loan repayments and $1.1 million of repayment of a financing leaseback related to the Bar-Lev transaction. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2012 was $42.5 million, which included $76.8 million of net IPO proceeds and $10.9 million of proceeds from the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility sale-leaseback arrangement, offset by a $27.2 million dividend to our pre-IPO shareholders, $11.4 million of net loan repayments and $6.2 million of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Caesarstone USA. Credit facilities As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any debt from commercial banks. Our long-term debt consists only of financing the lease-back related to the Bar-Lev sale and lease-back transaction with the Kibbutz. We also received a loan on January 17, 2011, in the amount of CAD 4.0 million ($4.1 million) to Caesarstone Canada Inc. by its shareholders, Ciot and ourselves, on a pro rata basis. The loan bears an interest rate until repayment at a per annum rate equal to the Bank of Canada’s prime business rate plus 0.25%, with the interest accrued on the loan paid on a quarterly basis. The loan balance as of December 31, 2014 was $1.6 million (reflects the portion of the loan received from Ciot), which was included in account payables to related parties. As of December 31, 2014, we had short-term credit lines with total availability of $9.9 million, consisting of $0.3 million from Israeli banks, none of which were utilized, and $9.6 million from Canadian banks none of which were utilized. Our revolving credit lines from Israeli banks and Canadian banks are subject to annual renewal. Our credit facilities and services provided by banks in Israel are secured with a “Negative floating pledge,” whereby we committed not to pledge or charge and not to undertake to pledge or charge our general floating assets. 60 Capital expenditures Our capital expenditures have included the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and capabilities, and investment and improvements in our information technology systems. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, our capital expenditures were $86.4, $27.4 million, and $13.5 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in capacity expansions in the next few years. Our investments related to the new U.S. manufacturing facility with first two production lines and the fifth production line in Israel are currently estimated to be approximately $115 million and $24 million, respectively, with approximately $75 million of the total U.S. investment being invested through December 31, 2014. The first production line in the new U.S. facility is planned to be operational in the second quarter of 2015, and the second production line is planned to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2015. After completion of first phase implementation of a new global ERP system in Israel and Canada in 2013, we completed in 2014 the roll-out of the ERP system in the United States and Australia. The investment in the roll-out phase was $0.8 million. Land purchase agreement and leaseback Pursuant to a land purchase agreement entered into on March 31, 2011, which became effective upon our IPO, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam acquired from us, our rights in the lands and facilities of the Bar-Lev Industrial Park in consideration for NIS 43.7 million (approximately $ 10.9 million). The carrying value of the Bar-Lev Grounds at the time of closing this transaction was NIS 39.0 million (approximately $ 9.9 million). The land purchase agreement was executed simultaneously with the execution of a land use agreement. Pursuant to the land use agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam permits us to use the Bar-Lev Grounds for a period of ten years commencing on September 2012, that will be automatically renewed, unless we give two years’ prior notice, for a ten-year term in consideration for an annual fee of NIS 4,146,000 (approximately $1.1 million) to be linked to increases in the Israeli consumer price index. The fee is subject to adjustment following January 1, 2021 and every three years thereafter at the option of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam if Kibbutz Sdot-Yam chooses to obtain an appraisal that supports such an increase. The appraiser would be mutually agreed upon or, in the absence of agreement, will be chosen by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam from a list of assessors recommended at that time by Bank Leumi. Our equipment that resides within the premises is considered integral equipment (as defined in ASC 360-20-15-4) due to the significant costs involved in relocating such equipment. Since we did not sell this equipment to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam as part of the transaction, the transaction is considered a partial sale and leaseback of real estate. As a result, the transaction does not qualify for “sale lease-back” accounting as defined under the relevant provisions of ASC 360-20, and we recorded the entire amount to be received as consideration as a liability while the land and building remained on our balance sheet until the end of the lease term under the provisions of ASC 840-40. As the amount to be paid under the sale-leaseback agreement accreted using our incremental borrowing rate would not cover the anticipated depreciated cost of the building and land at the end of the lease the entire amount paid will be accreted to the anticipated book value of the land and building at the end of the lease term using the effective interest method. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses Our research and development department is located in Israel and is comprised of 14 employees with extensive experience in engineered quartz surface manufacturing, polymer science, engineering, product design and engineered quartz surface applications. A small portion of our research and development efforts had benefited from grants from the OCS in the Israeli Ministry of Economy. OCS program ended during 2013. In 2014, research and development costs accounted for approximately 0.6% of our total revenues. We have begun to pursue a strategy of seeking patent protection for some of our technologies. We have obtained patents for certain of our technologies and have pending patent applications that were filed in various jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Australia, China and Israel, which relate to our manufacturing technology and certain products. We act to protect other innovative proprietary technologies developed by us by implementing confidentiality protection measures without pursuing patent registration. No patent application is material to the overall conduct of our business. Research and development expenses, net of grants received, were $2.6 million, $2.0 million and $ 2.1 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For a description of our research and development policies, see “ITEM 4.B: Information on Caesarstone—Business Overview—Research and development.” D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial condition. 61 E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

Employment and consulting agreements with executive officers We have entered into written employment or service agreements with each of our executive officers and with our chairman of the board of directors. Employment agreements We have entered into written employment or services agreements with each of our office holders who is not a director and with our Chairman. These agreements each contain customary provisions regarding non-competition, confidentiality of information and assignment of inventions. The non-competition provision generally applies for a period of six months following termination of employment. The enforceability of covenants not to compete in Israel and the United States is subject to limitations. In addition, we are required to provide notice of between two and six months prior to terminating the employment of certain of our senior executive officers other than in the case of a termination for cause. Indemnification agreements Our articles of association permit us to exculpate, indemnify and insure our office holders to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to limited exceptions. We have entered into agreements with each of our current office holders exculpating them from a breach of their duty of care to us to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to limited exceptions, and undertaking to indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by law, including with respect to liabilities resulting from our IPO to the extent that these liabilities are not covered by insurance. See “ITEM 6.C: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Board Practices—Exculpation, insurance and indemnification of office holders.” Directors’ service contracts There are no arrangements or understandings between us and any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of our directors, on the other hand, providing for benefits upon termination of their employment or service as directors of our company or any of our subsidiaries. 68 Equity incentive plan We adopted the 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2011 plan”) in July 2011. We provide stock-based compensation under the 2011 plan to our directors, executive officers, employees and consultants, and those of our affiliates. In 2012, we granted to certain of our key employees and our executive officers, options to purchase 1,545,200 of our ordinary shares at a weighted average exercise price of $11.13 per share. Following dividend distributions equal to $0.58 and $0.57 per share made by us in November 2013 and December 2014, respectively and under an adjustment mechanism of the exercise price set forth in the 2011 plan, the current weighted average exercise price is $10.09. As of February 28, 2015, 35,133,568 shares were issued and outstanding. The 2011 plan is intended to further our success by increasing the ownership interest of certain of our and our subsidiaries’ employees, directors and consultants and to enhance our and our subsidiaries’ ability to attract and retain employees, directors and consultants. The number of ordinary shares allocated under the 2011 plan is 2,375,000 ordinary shares, and considering the number of options already granted, we may issue an additional 1,206,580 options under the 2011 plan. The number of shares subject to the 2011 plan is also subject to adjustment if particular capital changes affect our share capital. Ordinary shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2011 plan that are subsequently forfeited or terminated for any other reason before being exercised will again be available for grant under the 2011 plan. A share option is the right to purchase a specified number of ordinary shares in the future at a specified exercise price and subject to the other terms and conditions specified in the option award agreement and the 2011 plan. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2011 plan will be determined by our compensation committee. The exercise price of any share options granted under the 2011 plan may be paid in cash, ordinary shares already owned by the option holder or any other method that may be approved by our compensation committee, such as a cashless broker-assisted exercise that complies with applicable laws. Our compensation committee may also grant, or recommend that our board of directors grant, other forms of equity incentive awards under the 2011 plan, such as share appreciation rights, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents and other forms of equity-based compensation. Israeli participants in the 2011 plan may be granted options subject to Section 102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance. Section 102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance, allows employees, directors and officers, who are not controlling shareholders and are considered Israeli residents to receive favorable tax treatment for compensation in the form of shares or options. Our non-employees service providers and controlling shareholders may only be granted options under another section of the Tax Ordinance, which does not provide for similar tax benefits. Section 102 includes two alternatives for tax treatment involving the issuance of options or shares to a trustee for the benefit of the grantees and also includes an additional alternative for the issuance of options or shares directly to the grantee. The most favorable tax treatment for the grantees is under Section 102(b)(2) of the Tax Ordinance, the issuance to a trustee under the “capital gain track.” However, under this track we are not allowed to deduct an expense with respect to the issuance of the options or shares. Any stock options granted under the 2011 plan to participants in the United States will be either “incentive stock options,” which may be eligible for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or options other than incentive stock options (referred to as “nonqualified stock options”), as determined by our compensation committee and stated in the option agreement. Our compensation committee administers the 2011 plan. Our board of directors may, subject to any legal limitations, exercise any powers or duties of the compensation committee concerning the 2011 plan. The compensation committee selects which of our and our subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ eligible employees, directors and/or consultants shall receive options or other awards under the 2011 plan and determines, or recommends to our board of directors, the number of ordinary shares covered by those options or other awards, the terms under which such options or other awards may be exercised (however, options generally may not be exercised later than 10 years from the grant date of an option) or may be settled or paid, and the other terms and conditions of such options and other awards under the 2011 plan. Holders of options and other equity incentive awards may not transfer those awards, unless they die or the compensation committee determines otherwise. If we undergo a change of control, as defined in the 2011 plan, subject to any contrary law or rule, or the terms of any award agreement in effect before the change of control, (a) the compensation committee may, in its discretion, accelerate the vesting, exercisability and payment, as applicable, of outstanding options and other awards; and (b) the compensation committee, in its discretion, may adjust outstanding awards by substituting ordinary shares or other securities of any successor or another party to the change of control transaction, or cash out outstanding options and other awards, in any such case, generally based on the consideration received by our shareholders in the transaction. Subject to particular limitations specified in the 2011 plan and under applicable law, our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2011 plan, and the compensation committee may amend awards outstanding under the 2011 plan. The 2011 plan will continue in effect until all ordinary shares available under the 2011 plan are delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the 2011 plan is terminated earlier by our board of directors. No awards may be granted under the 2011 plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the date of adoption of the plan. 69 The Board recently approved a grant of phantom options to several of our key employees. Each such option entitles its owner to get the intrinsic value of the difference between the share price at the time of such options grant and the share price at the time of the option's exercise. A total of 136,000 phantom options have been granted with a weighted exercise price of $46.65. Following a dividend distribution equal to $0.57 per share made by us in December 2014 and under an adjustment mechanism of the exercise price set forth in the phantom agreements, the current weighted average exercise price is $46.08. The phantom options shall be vested during a four year period, and its value may be paid by us at our election, subject to the board decision, either in cash or by our ordinary shares. Similar terms of the 2011 plan apply to the phantom options. The cost of such grant will be treated as a liability award and, therefore will be subject to quarterly fluctuations associated with our share price. The fair value of the phantom options granted under the plan using a binomial model is estimated to be approximately $4.1 million as of December 31, 2014 out of which $1.6 million was already recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014, and the remaining portion will be recognized over a three-year period commencing January, 2015. Grant of stock options to chief executive officer In March 2012, we granted to Yosef Shiran, our Chief Executive Officer, personally, options to purchase ordinary shares equal to 2% of the number of our shares immediately outstanding following the pricing of our IPO in consideration for serving as a director and chairman of the board of directors of our subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Singapore and Australia. The exercise price of the options was equal to $11.00, the IPO price per share. Additional options, totaling 19,980 shares, were issued after the exercise of the IPO’s over-allotment option by the underwriters, with an exercise price of $11.00. The exercise price of the options was subject to adjustment to reflect the impact of any dividend distributions prior to the exercise of the option and also to reflect the impact of any stock dividend and other rights that could be granted to all of our shareholders, including rights to purchase our securities, and was accordingly adjusted to $10.42 following the dividend distribution in November 2013. As of February 28, 2015, Yosef Shiran, our Chief Executive Officer, did not hold any options. The grant of new options to Yosef Shiran, our Chief Executive Officer, is subject to the approval of 75% of our board members in office, in addition to any approvals required under the Israeli Companies Law. C. Board Practices Corporate governance practices As a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to follow Israeli corporate governance practices instead of Nasdaq corporate governance rules, provided that we disclose which requirements we are not following and the equivalent Israeli requirement. We rely on this “foreign private issuer exemption” with respect to the following items: · As permitted under the Companies Law, pursuant to our articles of association, the quorum required for any meeting of shareholders consists of at least two shareholders present in person, by proxy or by other voting instrument in accordance with the Companies Law, who hold at least 25% of the voting power of our shares, instead of 33 1/3% of the issued share capital required under the Nasdaq requirements. At an adjourned meeting, any number of shareholders constitutes a quorum for the business for which the original meeting was called. · We approve the adoption of, and material changes to, equity incentive plans in accordance with the Companies Law, which does not impose a requirement of shareholder approval for such actions. Otherwise, we comply with Nasdaq corporate governance rules generally applicable to U.S. domestic companies listed on Nasdaq. We may in the future decide to use the foreign private issuer exemption with respect to some or all of the other Nasdaq Global Select Market corporate governance rules. We also comply with Israeli corporate governance requirements under the Companies Law applicable to public companies. Board of directors and officers As of February 28, 2015, our board of directors consists of 11 directors, six of whom are independent under the Nasdaq rules, including Ms. Ben-Dov and Mr. Borovsky, who serve as our external directors and whose appointment fulfills the requirements of the Companies Law for the company to have two external directors (see “—External directors”). Specifically, our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Yonatan Melamed, Moshe Ronen, Ram Belnikov, Ofer Tsimchi and Ofer Borovsky and Ms. Irit Ben Dov meet the independence standards under the rules of Nasdaq. In reaching this conclusion, the board of directors determined, following the recommendation of our nomination committee, that none of these directors has a relationship that would preclude a finding of independence and any relationships that these directors have with us do not impair their independence. Further, Ms. Irit Ben-Dov, Mr. Ofer Borovsky and Mr. Moshe Ronen, are each independent under the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. Our board of directors determined that at least one director must have “accounting and financial expertise”, as such term is defined by regulations promulgated under the Companies Law. The board of directors determined that each of Mr. Ofer Borovsky and Ms. Irit Ben-Dov has “accounting and financial expertise”. Our board of directors has further determined that each of Mr. Ofer Borovsky and Ms. Irit Ben-Dov qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert,” as defined by the rules of the SEC and has the requisite financial experience required by the Nasdaq Stock Market rules. 70 Under our articles of association, the number of directors on our board of directors must be no less than seven and no more than 11 and must include at least two external directors. The minimum and maximum number of directors may be changed, at any time and from time to time, by a simple majority vote of our shareholders at a shareholders’ meeting. Each director holds office until the annual general meeting of our shareholders in the subsequent year unless the tenure of such director expires earlier pursuant to the Companies Law or unless he or she is removed from office as described below, except our external directors, who have a term of office of three years under Israeli law (see “—External directors—Election and dismissal of external directors”). The directors who are serving in office shall be entitled to act even if a vacancy occurs on the board of directors. However, should the number of directors, at the time in question, become less than the minimum set forth in our articles of association, the remaining director(s) would be entitled to act for the purpose of filling the vacancies or to convene a general meeting, but not for any other purpose. Any director who retires from his or her office would be qualified to be re-elected subject to any limitation affecting such director’s appointment as a director under the Companies Law. See “—External directors” for a description of the provisions relating to the reelection of external directors. A general meeting of our shareholders may remove a director from office prior to the expiry of his or her term in office (“Removed Director”) by a simple majority vote (except for External Directors, who may be dismissed only as set forth under the Companies Law), provided that the Removed Director is given a reasonable opportunity to state his or her case before the general meeting. If a director is removed from office as set forth above, the general meeting shall be entitled, in the same session, to elect another director in his or her stead in accordance with the maximum number of directors permitted as stated above. Should it fail to do so, the board of directors shall be entitled to do so. Any director who is appointed in this manner shall serve in office for the period remaining of the term in office of the director who was removed and shall be qualified to be re-elected. Any amendment of our articles of association regarding the election of directors, as described above, require a simple majority vote. See “—External directors” for a description of the procedure for the election of external directors. In addition, under the Companies Law, our board of directors must determine the minimum number of directors who are required to have financial and accounting expertise. Under applicable regulations, a director with financial and accounting expertise is a director who, by reason of his or her education, professional experience and skill, has a high level of proficiency in and understanding of business accounting matters and financial statements. See “—External directors—Qualifications of external directors.” He or she must be able to thoroughly comprehend the financial statements of the company and initiate debate regarding the manner in which financial information is presented. In determining the number of directors required to have such expertise, the board of directors must consider, among other things, the type and size of the company and the scope and complexity of its operations. Our board of directors has determined that we require at least one director with the requisite financial and accounting expertise and that each of Mr. Ofer Borovsky and Ms. Irit Ben-Dov has such expertise. There are no family relationships among any of our office holders (including directors). Alternate directors Our articles of association provide, as allowed by the Companies Law, that any director may, by written notice to us, appoint another person who is qualified to serve as a director to serve as an alternate director. The appointment of an alternate director shall be subject to the consent of the board of directors. The alternate director will be regarded as a director. Under the Companies Law, a person who is not qualified to be appointed as a director, a person who is already serving as a director or a person who is already serving as an alternate director for another director, may not be appointed as an alternate director. Nevertheless, a director who is already serving as a director may be appointed as an alternate director for a member of a committee of the board of directors so long as he or she is not already serving as a member of such committee, and if the alternate director is to replace an external director, he or she is required to be an external director and to have either “financial and accounting expertise” or “professional expertise,” depending on the qualifications of the external director he or she is replacing. A person who does not have the requisite “financial and accounting experience” or the “professional expertise,” depending on the qualifications of the external director he or she is replacing, may not be appointed as an alternate director for an external director. A person who is not qualified to be appointed as an independent director, pursuant to the Companies Law, may not be appointed as an alternate director of an independent director qualified as such under the Companies Law. The term of appointment of an alternate director may be for one meeting of the board of directors or until notice is given of the cancellation of the appointment. 71 External directors Qualifications of external directors Under the Companies Law, companies incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel that are “public companies,” including companies with shares listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, are required to appoint at least two external directors who meet the qualification requirements set forth in the Companies Law. Appointment of external directors must be made by a general meeting of our shareholders. At a shareholders’ meeting held on December 3, 2014, each of Mr. Ofer Borovsky and Ms. Irit Ben-Dov was re-elected to serve as external directors of the Company for an additional three-year term commencing on March 21, 2015. A person may not be appointed as an external director if the person is a relative of a controlling shareholder or if on the date of the person’s appointment or within the preceding two years the person or his or her relatives, partners, employers or anyone to whom that person is subordinate, whether directly or indirectly, or entities under the person’s control have or had any affiliation with any of (each an “Affiliated Party”): (1) us; (2) any person or entity controlling us on the date of such appointment; (3) any relative of a controlling shareholder; or (4) any entity controlled, on the date of such appointment or within the preceding two years, by us or by our controlling shareholder. If there is no controlling shareholder or any shareholder holding 25% or more of voting rights in the company, a person may not serve as an external director if the person has any affiliation to the chairman of the board of directors, the general manager (chief executive officer), any shareholder holding 5% or more of the company’s shares or voting rights or the senior financial officer as of the date of the person’s appointment. The term “controlling shareholder” means a shareholder with the ability to direct the activities of the company, other than by virtue of being an office holder. A shareholder is presumed to have “control” of the company and thus to be a controlling shareholder of the company if the shareholder holds 50% or more of the “means of control” of the company. “Means of control” is defined as (1) the right to vote at a general meeting of a company or a corresponding body of another corporation; or (2) the right to appoint directors of the corporation or its general manager. The term affiliation includes: · an employment relationship; · a business or professional relationship maintained on a regular basis; · control; and · service as an office holder, excluding service as a director in a private company prior to the first offering of its shares to the public if such director was appointed as a director of the private company in order to serve as an external director following the initial public offering. The term “relative” is defined as a spouse, sibling, parent, grandparent, descendant, spouse’s descendant, sibling and parent and the spouse of each of the foregoing. The term “office holder” is defined as a general manager, chief business manager, deputy general manager, vice general manager, or any other person assuming the responsibilities of any of the foregoing positions, without regard to such person’s title, and a director or manager directly subordinate to the general manager. A person may not serve as an external director if that person or that person’s relative, partner, employer, a person to whom such person is subordinate (directly or indirectly) or any entity under the person’s control has a business or professional relationship with any entity that has an affiliation with any Affiliated Party, even if such relationship is intermittent (excluding insignificant relationships). Additionally, any person who has received compensation intermittently (excluding insignificant relationships) other than compensation permitted under the Companies Law may not continue to serve as an external director. No person can serve as an external director if the person’s position or other affairs create, or may create, a conflict of interest with the person’s responsibilities as a director or may otherwise interfere with the person’s ability to serve as a director or if such a person is an employee of the Israel Securities Authority or of an Israeli stock exchange. If at the time an external director is appointed all current members of the board of directors, who are not controlling shareholders or relatives of controlling shareholders, are of the same gender, then the external director to be appointed must be of the other gender. In addition, a person who is a director of a company may not be elected as an external director of another company if, at that time, a director of the other company is acting as an external director of the first company. 72 The Companies Law provides that an external director must meet certain professional qualifications or have financial and accounting expertise, and that at least one external director must have financial and accounting expertise. However, if at least one of our other directors (1) meets the independence requirements of the Exchange Act, (2) meets the Nasdaq requirements for membership on the audit committee and (3) has financial and accounting expertise as defined in the Companies Law and applicable regulations, then neither of our external directors is required to possess financial and accounting expertise as long as both possess other requisite professional qualifications. The determination of whether a director possesses financial and accounting expertise is made by the board of directors. A director with financial and accounting expertise is a director who by virtue of his or her education, professional experience and skill, has a high level of proficiency in and understanding of business accounting matters and financial statements so that he or she is able to fully understand our financial statements and initiate debate regarding the manner in which the financial information is presented. The regulations promulgated under the Companies Law define an external director with requisite professional qualifications as a director who satisfies one of the following requirements: (1) the director holds an academic degree in either economics, business administration, accounting, law or public administration, (2) the director either holds an academic degree in any other field or has completed another form of higher education in the company’s primary field of business or in an area which is relevant to his or her office as an external director in the company, or (3) the director has at least five years of experience serving in any one of the following, or at least five years of cumulative experience serving in two or more of the following capacities: (a) a senior business management position in a company with a substantial scope of business, (b) a senior position in the company’s primary field of business or (c) a senior position in public administration. Until the lapse of a two-year period from the date that an external director has ceased to act as an external director neither a company, nor its controlling shareholders, including any corporations controlled by a controlling shareholder, may grant such former external director or his or her spouse or children any benefits (directly or indirectly), including that (i) such persons may not be engaged to serve as an office holder at the company or any corporation controlled by a controlling shareholder, and (ii) such persons also may not be employed or receive professional services for payment from a controlling shareholder, (directly or indirectly), including through a corporation controlled by a controlling shareholder. Additionally, until the lapse of a one-year period from the date that an external director has ceased to act as an external director, any relative of the former external director who is not his or her spouse or children is also subject to the prohibitions described above. Election and dismissal of external directors Under Israeli law, external directors are elected by a majority vote at a shareholders’ meeting, provided that either: · the majority of the shares that are voted at the meeting in favor of the election of the external director, excluding abstentions, include at least a majority of the votes of shareholders who are not controlling shareholders or have a personal interest in the appointment (excluding a personal interest that did not result from the shareholder’s relationship with the controlling shareholder); or · the total number of shares held by the shareholders mentioned in the paragraph above that are voted against the election of the external director does not exceed two percent of the aggregate voting rights in the company. Under Israeli law, the initial term of an external director of an Israeli public company is three years. The external director may be reelected, subject to certain circumstances and conditions, to two additional terms of three years, each if: · his/her service for each such additional term is recommended by one or more shareholders holding at least 1% of the company’s voting rights and is approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a disinterested majority, where the total number of shares held by non-controlling, disinterested shareholders voting for such reelection exceeds 2% of the aggregate voting rights in the company, subject to additional restrictions set forth in the Companies Law with respect to the affiliation of the external director nominee, as described above; · the external director proposed his or her own nomination, and such nomination was approved in accordance with the requirements described in the paragraph above; or · his/her service for each such additional term is recommended by the board of directors and is approved at a meeting of shareholders by the same majority required for the initial election of an external director (as described above). 73 The term of office for external directors for Israeli companies traded on certain foreign stock exchanges, including the Nasdaq Global Select Market, may be further extended, indefinitely, in increments of additional three-year terms, in each case provided that: (i) both the audit committee and the board of directors confirm that, in light of the expertise and contribution of the external director, the extension of such external director’s term would be in the interest of the company; (ii) the appointment to the additional term is subject to the reelection provision described above; and (iii) the term during which the nominee served as an external director and the board of directors’ and audit committee’s reasoning for the extension of such term were presented before the general meeting of shareholders prior to the approval of the extension. An external director may be removed by the same special majority of the shareholders required for his or her election, if he or she ceases to meet the statutory qualifications for appointment or if he or she violates his or her fiduciary duty to the company. An external director may also be removed by order of an Israeli court if the court finds that the external director is permanently unable to exercise his or her office, has ceased to meet the statutory qualifications for his or her appointment, has violated his or her fiduciary duty to the company, or has been convicted by a court outside Israel of certain offenses detailed in the Companies Law. If the vacancy of an external directorship causes a company to have fewer than two external directors, the company’s board of directors is required under the Companies Law to call a special general meeting of the company’s shareholders as soon as possible to appoint such number of new external directors so that the company thereafter has two external directors. Additional provisions Under the Companies Law, each committee authorized to exercise any of the powers of the board of directors is required to include at least one external director and its audit and compensation committees are required to include all of the external directors. An external director is entitled to compensation and reimbursement of expenses in accordance with regulations promulgated under the Companies Law and is prohibited from receiving any other compensation, directly or indirectly, in connection with serving as a director except for certain exculpation, indemnification and insurance provided by the company, as specifically allowed by the Companies Law. Audit committee Companies Law requirements Under the Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must also appoint an audit committee comprised of at least three directors, including all of the external directors. The audit committee may not include: · the chairman of the board of directors; · a controlling shareholder or a relative of a controlling shareholder; and · any director employed by, or providing services on an ongoing basis to, the company, a controlling shareholder of the company or an entity controlled by a controlling shareholder of the company or any director who derives most of his or her income from the controlling shareholder. According to the Companies Law, the majority of the members of the audit committee, as well as the majority of members present at audit committee meetings, will be required to be “independent” (as defined below) and the chairman of the audit committee will be required to be an external director. Any persons disqualified from serving as a member of the audit committee may not be present at the audit committee meetings, unless the chairman of the audit committee has determined that such person is required to be present at the meeting or if such person qualifies under one of the exemptions of the Companies Law. The term “independent director” is defined under the Companies Law as an external director or a director who meets the following conditions and who is appointed or classified as such according to the Companies Law: (1) the conditions for his or her appointment as an external director (as described above) are satisfied and the audit committee approves the director having met such conditions and (2) he or she has not served as a director of the company for over nine consecutive years with any interruption of up to two years of his or her service not being deemed a disruption to the continuity of his or her service. 74 Nasdaq requirements Under the Nasdaq rules, we are required to maintain an audit committee consisting of at least three independent directors, all of whom are financially literate and one of whom has accounting or related financial management expertise. Our audit committee consists of Yonathan Melamed, Irit Ben Dov and Ofer Borovsky. Irit Ben-Dov serves as the Chairman of the audit committee. All members of our audit committee meet the requirements for financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq rules. Our board of directors has determined that each of Ofer Borovsky and Irit Ben-Dov qualify as audit committee financial experts as defined by the SEC rules and has the requisite financial experience as defined by the Nasdaq rules. Each of the members of the audit committee is “independent” under the relevant Nasdaq rules and as defined in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act, which is different from the general test for independence of board and committee members. Approval of transactions with related parties The approval of the audit committee is required to effect specified actions and transactions with office holders and controlling shareholders and their relatives, or in which they have a personal interest. See “—Fiduciary duties and approval of specified related party transactions under Israeli law.” For the purpose of approving transactions with controlling shareholders, the term “controlling shareholder” also includes any shareholder that holds 25% or more of the voting rights of the company if the company has no shareholder that owns more than 50% of its voting rights. For purposes of determining the holding percentage stated above, two or more shareholders who have a personal interest in a transaction that is brought for the company’s approval are deemed as joint holders. The audit committee may not approve an action or a transaction with a controlling shareholder or with an office holder unless at the time of approval the audit committee meets the composition requirements under the Companies Law. Audit committee role Our board of directors has adopted an audit committee charter setting forth the responsibilities of the audit committee consistent with the rules of the SEC and the Nasdaq rules, which include, among other responsibilities: · retaining and terminating our independent auditors, subject to board of directors and shareholder ratification; · pre-approval of audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors; · reviewing with management and our independent directors our quarterly and annual financial reports prior to their submission to the SEC; and · approval of certain transactions with office holders and controlling shareholders, as described above, and other related-party transactions. Additionally, under the Companies Law, the role of the audit committee includes the identification of irregularities in our business management, among other things, by consulting with the internal auditor or our independent auditors and suggesting an appropriate course of action to the board of directors. In addition, the audit committee or the board of directors, as set forth in the articles of association of the company, is required to approve the yearly or periodic work plan proposed by the internal auditor. The audit committee is required to assess the company’s internal audit system and the performance of its internal auditor. The Companies Law also requires that the audit committee assess the scope of the work and compensation of the company’s external auditor. In addition, the audit committee is required to determine whether certain related party actions and transactions are “material” or “extraordinary” for the purpose of the requisite approval procedures under the Companies Law, whether certain transactions with a controlling shareholder will be subject to a competitive procedure (regardless of whether or not such transactions are deemed extraordinary transactions) and to set forth the approval process for transactions that are “non-negligible” (i.e. transactions with a controlling shareholder that are classified by the audit committee as non-negligible, even though they are not deemed extraordinary transactions), as well as determining which types of transactions would require the approval of the audit committee, optionally based on criteria which may be determined annually in advance by the audit committee. The audit committee charter states that in fulfilling its role the committee is entitled to demand from us any document, file, report or any other information that is required for the fulfillment of its roles and duties and to interview any of our employees or any employees of our subsidiaries in order to receive more details about his or her line of work or other issues that are connected to the roles and duties of the audit committee. 75 Nominating Committee On September 30, 2014, our board of directors established a nominating committee comprised of three of our directors, Ms. Irit Ben-Dov, Mr. Ofer Borovsky and Mr. Moshe Ronen, each of whom has been determined by our board of directors to be independent under the applicable Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Our board of directors has adopted a nominating committee charter setting forth the responsibilities of the committee which include, among other responsibilities: · conduct of the appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates to serve as directors; · review and recommend to the board any nominees for election as directors, including nominees recommended by shareholders, and consideration of the performance of incumbent directors whose terms are expiring in determining whether to nominate them to stand for re-election; · review and recommend to the board regarding board member qualifications, board composition and structure, and recommend if necessary, measures to be taken so that the board reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity required for the board; and · perform such other activities and functions as are required by applicable law, stock exchange rules or provisions in our Articles of Association, or as are otherwise necessary and advisable, in its or the board’s discretion, for the efficient discharge of its duties. Compensation Committee We have a compensation committee consisting of three of our directors, Ofer Borovsky, Irit Ben-Dov and Moshe Ronen, each of whom has been determined by our board of directors to be independent under the applicable Nasdaq rules. Ofer Borovsky serves as the Chairman of the compensation committee. Our board has adopted a compensation committee charter setting forth the responsibilities of the committee which include, among other responsibilities: · reviewing and recommending overall compensation policies with respect to our Chief Executive Officer and other office holders; · reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other office holders including evaluating their performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining their compensation based on such evaluation; · reviewing and approving the granting of options and other incentive awards; and · reviewing, evaluating and making recommendations regarding the compensation and benefits for our non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee is also authorized to retain and terminate compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisors to the committee and to approve the engagement of any such consultant, counsel or advisor, to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate. Pursuant to the Companies Law, Israeli public companies are required to appoint a compensation committee comprised of at least three directors, including all of the external directors, who must also constitute a majority of its members. All other members of the compensation committee, who are not external directors, must be directors who receive compensation that is in compliance with regulations promulgated under the Companies Law. In addition, the chairperson of the compensation committee must be an external director. The Companies Law further stipulates that directors who are not qualified to serve on the audit committee, as described above, may not serve on the compensation committee either and that, similar to the audit committee, generally, any person who is not entitled to be a member of the compensation committee may not attend the compensation committee’s meetings. The responsibilities of the compensation committee under the Companies Law include: (i) making recommendations to the board of directors with respect to the approval of the compensation policy and any extensions thereto; (ii) periodically reviewing the implementation of the compensation policy and providing the board of directors with recommendations with respect to any amendments or updates thereto; (iii) reviewing and resolving whether or not to approve arrangements with respect to the terms of office and employment of office holders; and (iv) resolving whether or not to exempt a transaction with a candidate for chief executive officer from shareholder approval. 76 Pursuant to the Companies Law, the compensation policy recommended by the compensation Committee needs to be approved by the board of directors and the company’s shareholders by a simple majority, provided that (i) such majority includes at least a majority of the shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and who do not have a personal interest in the matter, present and voting (abstentions are disregarded), or (ii) the non-controlling shareholders or shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the matter who were present and voted against the policy, holds two percent or less of the voting power of the company. However, under the Companies Law, where shareholders of the company do not approve the compensation policy, the compensation committee and board of directors may override the shareholders’ decision if each of the compensation committee and board of directors provide detailed reasons for their decision. In addition, pursuant the Companies Law, the compensation policy must be approved, at least once every three years, by the company’s board of directors, after considering the recommendations of the compensation committee. Our compensation policy became effective on May 18, 2014 following its approval by our board of directors (per the recommendation of our compensation committee), in accordance with the authority granted to our board under the Companies Law. Our Compensation Policy includes, among other things, provisions relating to equity-based compensation for our executive officers. The compensation policy provides, among others, that: (i) such equity-based compensation is intended to be in a form of share options and/or other equity based awards, such as restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and share-based compensation, in accordance with the Company’s equity incentive plan in place as may be updated from time to time; (ii) all equity-based incentives granted to executive officers shall be subject to vesting periods in order to promote long-term retention of the awarded executive officers. Unless determined otherwise in a specific award agreement approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors, grants to executive officers will vest gradually over a period of between three to four years; and (iii) all other terms of the equity awards shall be in accordance with our incentive plans and other related practices and policies. The board of directors may, following approval by the compensation committee, extend the period of time for which an award is to remain exercisable and make provisions with respect to the acceleration of the vesting period of any executive officer’s awards, including, without limitation, in connection with a corporate transaction involving a change of control, subject to any additional approval as may be required by the Companies Law. The compensation policy also provides that the equity-based compensation shall be granted from time to time and be individually determined and awarded according to the performance, educational background, prior business experience, qualifications, role and the personal responsibilities of the executive officer. The fair market value of the equity-based compensation for the executive officers will be determined according to acceptable valuation practices at the time of grant. In addition, on February 21, 2014, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association under which resolutions of the board of directors will be resolved by a special majority of the directors if specifically required so by the compensation policy. Among others, our compensation policy determines that a grant of equity awards and any compensation to our chief executive officer shall be subject in addition to any approval required by the Israeli Companies Law, to the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the directors then in office. Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers Directors. Under the Companies Law, the compensation of our directors requires the approval of our compensation committee, the subsequent approval of the board of directors and, unless exempted under the regulations promulgated under the Companies Law, the approval of the shareholders at a general meeting. If the compensation of our directors is inconsistent with our compensation policy, then, provided that those provisions that must be included in the compensation policy according to the Companies Law have been considered by the compensation committee and board of directors, shareholder approval will also be required, as follows: · at least a majority of the shares held by all shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and do not have a personal interest in such matter, present and voting at such meeting, are voted in favor of the compensation package, excluding abstentions; or · the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders and shareholders who do not have a personal interest in such matter voting against the compensation package does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights in the company. Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. The Companies Law requires the compensation of a public company’s executive officers (other than the chief executive officer) to be approved by, first, the compensation committee; second by the company’s board of directors and third, if such compensation arrangement is inconsistent with the company’s stated compensation policy, the company’s shareholders (by a special majority vote as discussed above with respect to the approval of director compensation). However, if the shareholders of the company do not approve a compensation arrangement with an executive officer that is inconsistent with the company’s stated compensation policy, the compensation committee and board of directors may override the shareholders’ decision if each of the compensation committee and the board of directors provide detailed reasons for their decision. 77 Chief Executive Officer. The compensation of a public company’s chief executive officer requires the approval of first, the company’s compensation committee; second, the company’s board of directors and third, the company’s shareholders (by a special majority vote as discussed above with respect to the approval of director compensation). However, if the shareholders of the company do not approve the compensation arrangement with the chief executive officer, the compensation committee and board of directors may override the shareholders’ decision if each of the compensation committee and the board of directors provide a detailed report for their decision. In addition, our compensation policy provides that a grant of any compensation to our chief executive officer shall be subject, in addition to any approval required under the Israeli Companies Law, to the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the directors then in office. The compensation committee and board of directors approval should be in accordance with the company’s stated compensation policy; however, in special circumstances, they may approve compensation terms of a chief executive officer that are inconsistent with such policy provided that they have considered those provisions that must be included in the compensation policy according to the Companies Law and that shareholder approval was obtained (by a special majority vote as discussed above with respect to the approval of director compensation). The compensation committee may waive the shareholder approval requirement with regards to the approval of the engagement terms of a candidate for the chief executive officer position, if they determine that the compensation arrangement is consistent with the company’s stated compensation policy, the chief executive officer did not have a business relationship with the company or a controlling shareholder of the company and that having the engagement transaction subject to a shareholder vote would impede the company’s ability to employ the chief executive officer candidate. Notwithstanding the above, the amendment of existing compensation terms of executive officers (including the chief executive officer and excluding officers who are also directors), requires only the approval of the compensation committee, provided that the committee determines that the amendment is not material in relation to the existing terms. Internal auditor Under the Companies Law, the board of directors of a public company must appoint an internal auditor based on the recommendation of the audit committee. The role of the internal auditor is, among other things, to examine whether a company’s actions comply with applicable law and orderly business procedure. Under the Companies Law, the internal auditor may not be an interested party or an office holder or a relative of an interested party or of an office holder, nor may the internal auditor be the company’s independent auditor or the representative of the same. An “interested party” is defined in the Companies Law as (i) a holder of 5% or more of the issued share capital or voting power in a company, (ii) any person or entity who has the right to designate one or more directors or to designate the chief executive officer of the company, or (iii) any person who serves as a director or as a chief executive officer of the company. Our internal auditor is Mr. Ofer Orlitzky of Leon, Orlitzky and Co. Fiduciary duties and approval of specified related party transactions under Israeli law Fiduciary duties of office holders The Companies Law imposes a duty of care and a duty of loyalty on all office holders of a company. The duty of care of an office holder is based on the duty of care set forth in connection with the tort of negligence under the Israeli Torts Ordinance (New Version) 5728-1968. The duty of care requires an office holder to act with the degree of proficiency with which a reasonable office holder in the same position would have acted under the same circumstances. The duty of care includes, among other things, a duty to use reasonable means, in light of the circumstances, to obtain: · information on the business advisability of a given action brought for his or her approval or performed by virtue of his or her position; and · all other important information pertaining to such action. 78 The duty of loyalty incumbent on an office holder requires him or her to act in good faith and for the benefit of the company, and includes, among other things, the duty to: · refrain from any act involving a conflict of interest between the performance of his or her duties in the company and his or her other duties or personal affairs; · refrain from any activity that is competitive with the business of the company; · refrain from exploiting any business opportunity of the company for the purpose of gaining a personal advantage for himself or herself or others; and · disclose to the company any information or documents relating to the company’s affairs which the office holder received as a result of his or her position as an office holder. We may approve an act specified above which would otherwise constitute a breach of the office holder’s duty of loyalty, provided that the office holder acted in good faith, the act or its approval does not harm the company, and the office holder discloses his or her personal interest, including any related material information or document, a sufficient time before the approval of such act. Any such approval is subject to the terms of the Companies Law, setting forth, among other things, the organs of the company entitled to provide such approval, and the methods of obtaining such approval. Disclosure of personal interests of an office holder and approval of transactions The Companies Law requires that an office holder promptly disclose to the company any personal interest that he or she may have and all related material information or documents relating to any existing or proposed transaction by the company. An interested office holder’s disclosure must be made promptly and in any event no later than the first meeting of the board of directors at which the transaction is considered. An office holder is not obliged to disclose such information if the personal interest of the office holder derives solely from the personal interest of his or her relative in a transaction that is not considered as an extraordinary transaction. Under the Companies Law, once an office holder has complied with the above disclosure requirement, a company may approve a transaction between the company and the office holder or a third party in which the office holder has a personal interest, pursuant to the certain procedures as set forth in the Companies Law. However, a company may not approve a transaction or action that is not to the company’s benefit. Under the Companies Law, unless the articles of association of a company provide otherwise, a transaction with an office holder or with a third party in which the office holder has a personal interest, which is not an extraordinary transaction, requires the approval by the board of directors. Our articles of association provide that such a transaction, which is not an extraordinary transaction, shall be approved by the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors or any other entity (which has no personal interest in the transaction) authorized by the board of directors. If the transaction considered is an extraordinary transaction with an office holder or a third party in which the office holder has a personal interest, then audit committee approval is required prior to approval by the board of directors. For the approval of compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers, see “— Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers.” Any person who has a personal interest in the approval of a transaction that is brought before a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee or the compensation committee may not be present at the meeting or vote on the matter. However, if the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the audit committee or the chairman of the compensation committee has determined that the presence of an office holder with a personal interest is required, such office holder may be present at the meeting for the purpose of presenting the matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a director who has a personal interest may be present at the meeting and vote on the matter if a majority of the directors or members of the audit committee have a personal interest in the approval of such transaction. If a majority of the directors at a board of directors meeting have a personal interest in the transaction, such transaction also requires approval of the shareholders of the company. A “personal interest” is defined under the Companies Law as the personal interest of a person in an action or in a transaction of the company, including the personal interest of such person’s relative or the interest of any other corporate body in which the person and/or such person’s relative is a director or general manager, a holder of 5% or more of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or its voting rights, or has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager, but excluding a personal interest stemming solely from the fact of holding shares in the company. A personal interest also includes (1) a personal interest of a person who votes according to a proxy of another person, including in the event that the other person has no personal interest, and (2) a personal interest of a person who gave a proxy to another person to vote on his or her behalf regardless of whether the discretion of how to vote lies with the person voting or not. 79 An “extraordinary transaction” is defined under the Companies Law as any of the following: · a transaction other than in the ordinary course of business; · a transaction that is not on market terms; or · a transaction that may have a material impact on the company’s profitability, assets or liabilities. Disclosure of personal interests of a controlling shareholder and approval of transactions The Companies Law also requires that a controlling shareholder promptly disclose to the company any personal interest that he or she may have and all related material information or documents relating to any existing or proposed transaction by the company. A controlling shareholder’s disclosure must be made promptly and in any event no later than the first meeting of the board of directors at which the transaction is considered. See “—Audit committee—Approval of transactions with related parties” for the definition of a controlling shareholder. Extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, including a private placement in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, and the terms of engagement of the company, directly or indirectly, with a controlling shareholder or a controlling shareholder’s relative (including through a corporation controlled by a controlling shareholder), regarding the company’s receipt of services from the controlling shareholder, and if such controlling shareholder is also an office holder or an employee of the company, regarding his or her terms of service or employment, require the approval of each of (i) the audit committee or the compensation committee with respect to the terms of the engagement of the company, (ii) the board of directors and (iii) the shareholders, in that order. In addition, the shareholder approval must fulfill one of the following requirements: · a majority of the shares held by shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction and are voting at the meeting must be voted in favor of approving the transaction, excluding abstentions; or · the shares voted by shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction who vote against the transaction represent no more than 2.0% of the voting rights in the company. In addition, any extraordinary transaction with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest with a term of more than three years requires the approval described above, every three years; however, transactions not involving the receipt of services or compensation can be approved for a longer term, provided that the audit committee determines that such longer term is reasonable under the circumstances. The Companies Law requires that every shareholder that participates, in person, by proxy or by voting instrument in a vote regarding a transaction with a controlling shareholder, must indicate in advance or in the ballot whether or not that shareholder has a personal interest in the vote in question. Failure to so indicate will result in the invalidation of that shareholder’s vote. Duties of shareholders Under the Companies Law, a shareholder has a duty to refrain from abusing its power in the company and to act in good faith and in an acceptable manner in exercising its rights and performing its obligations to the company and to other shareholders, including, among other things, when voting at meetings of shareholders on the following matters: · an amendment to the articles of association; · an increase in the company’s authorized share capital; · a merger; and · the approval of related party transactions and acts of office holders that require shareholder approval. A shareholder also has a general duty to refrain from discriminating against other shareholders. The remedies generally available upon a breach of contract will also apply to a breach of the shareholder duties mentioned above, and in the event of discrimination against other shareholders, additional remedies are available to the injured shareholder. In addition, any controlling shareholder, any shareholder that knows that its vote can determine the outcome of a shareholder vote and any shareholder that, under a company’s articles of association, has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder, or any other power with respect to a company, is under a duty to act with fairness towards the company. The Companies Law does not describe the substance of this duty except to state that the remedies generally available upon a breach of contract will also apply in the event of a breach of the duty to act with fairness, taking the shareholder’s position in the company into account. 80 Approval of private placements Under the Companies Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, a private placement of securities does not require approval at a general meeting of the shareholders of a company; provided however, that in special circumstances, such as a private placement completed in lieu of a special tender offer (see “ITEM 10.B: Additional Information—Memorandum and Articles of Association—Acquisitions under Israeli law”) or a private placement which qualifies as a related party transaction (see “—Fiduciary duties and approval of specified related party transactions under Israeli law”), approval at a general meeting of the shareholders of a company is required. Exculpation, insurance and indemnification of office holders Under the Companies Law, a company may not exculpate an office holder from liability for a breach of a fiduciary duty. An Israeli company may exculpate an office holder in advance from liability to the company, in whole or in part, for damages caused to the company as a result of a breach of duty of care but only if a provision authorizing such exculpation is included in its articles of association. Our articles of association include such a provision. The company may not exculpate in advance a director from liability arising out of a prohibited dividend or distribution to shareholders. Under the Companies Law and the Securities Law, 5738—1968 (the “Securities Law”) a company may indemnify an office holder in respect of the following liabilities, payments and expenses incurred for acts performed by him as an office holder, either in advance of an event or following an event, provided its articles of association include a provision authorizing such indemnification: · a monetary liability incurred by or imposed on him or her in favor of another person pursuant to a judgment, including a settlement or arbitrator’s award approved by a court. However, if an undertaking to indemnify an office holder with respect to such liability is provided in advance, then such an undertaking must be limited to events which, in the opinion of the board of directors, can be foreseen based on the company’s activities when the undertaking to indemnify is given, and to an amount or according to criteria determined by the board of directors as reasonable under the circumstances, and such undertaking shall detail the foreseen events described above and amount or criteria; · reasonable litigation expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the office holder as a result of an investigation or proceeding instituted against him or her by an authority authorized to conduct such investigation or proceeding, provided that (i) no indictment was filed against such office holder as a result of such investigation or proceeding; and (ii) no financial liability, was imposed upon him or her as a substitute for the criminal proceeding as a result of such investigation or proceeding or, if such financial liability was imposed, it was imposed with respect to an offense that does not require proof of criminal intent or in connection with a monetary sanction; · a monetary liability imposed on him or her in favor of an injured party at an Administrative Procedure (as defined below) pursuant to Section 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Securities Law; · expenses incurred by an office holder in connection with an Administrative Procedure under the Securities Law, including reasonable litigation expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and · reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the office holder or imposed by a court in proceedings instituted against him or her by the company, on its behalf, or by a third party, or in connection with criminal proceedings in which the office holder was acquitted, or as a result of a conviction for an offense that does not require proof of criminal intent. An “Administrative Procedure” is defined as a procedure pursuant to chapters H3 (Monetary Sanction by the Israeli Securities Authority), H4 (Administrative Enforcement Procedures of the Administrative Enforcement Committee) or I1 (Arrangement to prevent Procedures or Interruption of procedures subject to conditions) to the Securities Law. Under the Companies Law and the Securities Law, a company may insure an office holder against the following liabilities incurred for acts performed by him or her as an office holder if and to the extent provided in the company’s articles of association: · a breach of a fiduciary duty to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not harm the company; 81 · a breach of duty of care to the company or to a third party, to the extent such a breach arises out of the negligent conduct of the office holder; · a monetary liability imposed on the office holder in favor of a third party; · a monetary liability imposed on the office holder in favor of an injured party at an Administrative Procedure pursuant to Section 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Securities Law; and · expenses incurred by an office holder in connection with an Administrative Procedure, including reasonable litigation expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Under the Companies Law, a company may not indemnify, exculpate or insure an office holder against any of the following: · a breach of fiduciary duty, except for indemnification and insurance for a breach of the fiduciary duty to the company to the extent that the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not prejudice the company; · a breach of duty of care committed intentionally or recklessly, excluding a breach arising out of the negligent conduct of the office holder; · an act or omission committed with intent to derive illegal personal benefit; or · a fine or forfeit levied against the office holder. Under the Companies Law, exculpation, indemnification and insurance of office holders must be approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors and, with respect to directors or controlling shareholders, their relatives and third parties in which such controlling shareholders have a personal interest, also by the shareholders. Our articles of association permit us to exculpate, indemnify and insure our office holders to the fullest extent permitted or to be permitted by law. Our office holders are currently covered by a directors and officers’ liability insurance policy. As of February 28, 2015, no claims for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance have been filed under this policy and, except with respect to the matter concerning styrene gas emission discussed in “ITEM 4.B: Information on Caesarstone—Business Overview—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters,” we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation or proceeding involving any of our office holders, including our directors, in which indemnification is or may be sought. We have entered into new agreements with each of our current office holders exculpating them from a breach of their duty of care to us to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to limited exceptions, and undertaking to indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to limited exceptions, including with respect to liabilities resulting from our IPO to the extent that these liabilities are not covered by insurance. This indemnification is limited to events determined as foreseeable by the board of directors based on our activities, and to an amount or according to criteria determined by the board of directors as reasonable under the circumstances. As of March 2013, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnification that we may pay to our office holders based on such new indemnification agreement is the greater of (1) with respect to indemnification in connection with a public offering of our securities, the gross proceeds raised by us and any selling shareholder in such public offering, and (2) with respect to all permitted indemnification, including in connection with a public offering of our securities, an amount equal to the greater of 50% of our shareholders’ equity on a consolidated basis, based on our most recent financial statements made publicly available before the date on which the indemnification payment was made, and $30 million. Such indemnification amounts are in addition to any insurance amounts. Each office holder who agrees to receive this letter of indemnification also gives his approval to the termination of all previous letters of indemnification that we have provided to him or her in the past, if any; however, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification of office holders for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy and therefore unenforceable. We previously entered into letters of indemnification with some former office holders that currently remain in effect, and pursuant to which we undertook to indemnify them with respect to certain liabilities and expenses then permitted under the Companies Law, which are similar to those described above. These letters of indemnification are limited to foreseeable events that were determined by the board of directors and indemnity payments are limited to a maximum amount of $2.0 million for one series of related events for each office holder. 82 D. Employees As of December 31, 2014, we had 1,108 employees, of whom 635 were based in Israel, including 72 individuals who provide services to us through our manpower agreement with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and with whom we do not have employment relationships, 266 employees in the United States, including 30 employees hired for our manufacturing operations in the State of Georgia, 97 employees in Australia, 87 in Canada and 23 in Asia. The following table shows the breakdown of our global workforce by category of activity as of December 31 for the past three fiscal years: As of December 31, Department 2014 2013 2012 Manufacturing and operations 659 595 537 Research and development 14 13 12 Sales, marketing, service and support 318 272 259 Management and administration 117 106 75 Total 1,108 986 883 The growth in the size of our global workforce by 122 employees in 2014 is related mainly to demand brought on by our additional manufacturing capacity in Israel and in the United States, as well as to the expansion of our sales and distribution operations in North America. The growth in our global workforce of 103 employees between 2012 and 2013 is largely due to the operation of the fifth production line at our Bar-Lev facility in Israel and our expanded distribution operations in the United States, Australia and Canada, including a shift to direct distribution in the United States Midwestern and Phoenix regions. Israeli labor laws (applicable to our Israeli employees) govern the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of employment. Subject to certain exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and requires us and our employees to make payments to the NII, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Our employees have pension plans in accordance with the applicable Israeli legal requirements. None of our employees work under any collective bargaining agreements. Extension orders issued by the Israeli Ministry of Economy apply to us and affect matters such as cost of living adjustments to salaries, length of working hours and week, recuperation pay, travel expenses, and pension rights. We have never experienced labor-related work stoppages or strikes and believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 83 E. Share Ownership Beneficial Ownership of Executive Officers and Directors The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of February 28, 2015, of each of our directors and executive officers. Name of Beneficial Owner Number of Shares Beneficially Held(1) Percent of Class Executive Officers Yosef Shiran - - Yair Averbuch * * David Cullen * * Sagi Cohen * * Giora Wegman - - Michal Baumwald Oron * * Eli Feiglin * * Erez Schweppe * * HaHHarel Boker * * Tzvika Rimon * * Erez Margalit * * Lilach Gilboa * * Directors Maxim Ohana - - Yonatan Melamed - - Moshe Ronen - - Ofer Tsimchi - - Or Gilboa - - Shachar Degani - - Amihai Beer - - Irit Ben-Dov - - Ofer Borovsky - - Ram Belinkov - - Avner Naveh - - All directors and executive officers as a group (23 persons) 135,480 0.4% ___________________________________ * Less than one percent of the outstanding ordinary shares. (1) As used in this table, “beneficial ownership” means the sole or shared power to vote or direct the voting or to dispose or direct the disposition of any security. For purposes of this table, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities that can be acquired within 60 days from February 28, 2015 through the exercise of any option or warrant. Ordinary shares subject to options or warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days are deemed outstanding for computing the ownership percentage of the person holding such options or warrants, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the ownership percentage of any other person. The amounts and percentages are based upon 35,133,568 ordinary shares outstanding as of February 28, 2015. All of our shareholders, including the shareholders listed above, have the same voting rights attached to their ordinary shares. See “ITEM 10.B: Additional Information—Memorandum and Articles of Association —Voting.” Our directors and executive officers hold, in the aggregate, options exercisable for 270,960 ordinary shares, as of February 28, 2015. These options have a weighted average exercise price of $9.85 per share and have expiration dates generally seven years after the grant date of the option. ITEM 7: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions a. Major Shareholders The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our outstanding ordinary shares as of the date indicated below, by each person who we know beneficially owns 5.0% or more of the outstanding ordinary shares. For information on the beneficial ownership of each of our directors and executive officers individually and as a group, see “ITEM 6.E: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Share Ownership.” Beneficial ownership of ordinary shares is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes any ordinary shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power, or the right to receive the economic benefit of ownership. For purposes of the table below, we deem shares subject to options or warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of February 28, 2015, to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of that person but we do not treat them as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

The address of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is MP Menashe 3780400, Israel. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is a communal society, referred to in Hebrew as a “kibbutz” (plural “kibbutzim”) with approximately 420 members and an additional 350 residents located in Israel on the Mediterranean coast between Tel Aviv and Haifa. Established in 1940, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is a largely self-governed community of members who share certain social ideals and professional interests on a communal basis. Initially, the social idea behind the formation of the kibbutzim in Israel was to create a communal society in which all members share equally in all of the society’s resources and which provides for the needs of the community. Over the years, the structure of the kibbutzim has evolved, and today there are a number of different economic and social arrangements adopted by various kibbutzim. Today, each member of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam continues to own an equal part of the assets of the Kibbutz. The members of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam are engaged in a number of economic activities, including agriculture, industrial operations and outdoor venue operations. A number of Kibbutz members are engaged in professions outside the Kibbutz. The Kibbutz is the owner and operator of several private companies. The Kibbutz community holds in common all land, buildings and production assets of these companies. Most of the members of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam work in one of the production activities of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, according to the requirements of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and the career objectives of the individual concerned. Some other members work outside of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam in businesses owned by other entities. Each member receives income based on the position the member holds and his or her economic contribution to the community, as well as on the size and composition of his or her family. Each member’s income depends on the income of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam from its economic activities. Each member has a personal pension fund that is funded by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, and all accommodation, educational, health and old age care services, as well as social and municipal services are provided either by or through Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and are subsidized by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. The elected Economic Council is the key economic decision-making body of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam also has a General Secretary and other senior officers, all of whom are elected by the members of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam at its General Meeting for terms of four years. A meeting of the members of the Kibbutz may remove a member of the Economic Council by simple majority vote. Our board of directors operates independently from the Economic Council. Mr. Shai Bober, who is engaged by us, is also a member of the Economic Council and members of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. Mr. Ohana is still involved in Kibbutz Sdot-Yam as a member, while Mr. Beer, who serves as secretary of the Economic Council, participates in meetings without voting rights and intends to resign from this position following his recent election to our board of directors. Since March 2014, Mr. Shachar Degani who serves as our director, has served as Kibbutz Sdot-Yam’s General Secretary.

Changes in Ownership Prior to our IPO in March 2012, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam owned 18,715,000, or 70.1% of our ordinary shares. After the IPO, due to our issuance of ordinary shares, the Kibbutz’s ownership in our ordinary shares decreased to 56.1%. As a result of two subsequent public offerings of ordinary shares filed in 2013 and 2014, the Kibbutz sold 6,325,000 of the 17,765,000 ordinary company shares it owned, decreasing its ownership percentage to 32.6%. Registered Holders Based on a review of the information provided to us by our transfer agent, as of February 28, 2015, there were two registered holders of our ordinary shares, one of which (Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary Trust Company) is a United States registered holder holding approximately 67.4% of our outstanding ordinary shares. b. Related Party Transactions Related Party Transactions Policy On May 25, 2014, our audit committee adopted a policy, which lays out the procedures for approving transactions with our controlling shareholder, currently Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, and certain of our office holders and other related persons. Pursuant to this policy, as required by the Companies Law, for each transaction with our controlling shareholder or transactions in which our controlling shareholder has a personal interest as well as transactions with our office holders or transactions in which our office holders have a personal interest, our audit committee is required to determine whether such transaction is an extraordinary transaction and, with respect to controlling shareholder transactions only, whether it is a negligible transaction. Subject to our audit committee’s determination, negligible transactions and non-extraordinary transactions are subject to a competitive procedure comprised of obtaining two third party quotes for such transaction and additional requirements as required by the Companies Law. An extraordinary transaction, which is not negligible, is subject, generally, to a tender in addition to the approvals required by the Companies Law. In addition, this policy determines certain transactions with our controlling shareholder as negligible and non-extraordinary transactions which are ongoing transactions but are required to be approved on an annual basis. Pursuant to this policy, we have, and may in the future, engage in transactions with our controlling shareholder and officeholders including with respect to services consumed by us for our operational needs as well as contribute donations to associations in which our controlling shareholder has a personal interest. 86 Relationship and agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam Our headquarters, research and development facilities and our two manufacturing facilities in Israel are located on lands leased by us from Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, which beneficially owns 32.6% of our shares. We have entered into certain agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam pursuant to which Kibbutz Sdot-Yam provides us with, among other things, a portion of our labor force, electricity, maintenance, and other services. Pursuant to certain of these agreements, in consideration for using facilities licensed to us or for services provided by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, we paid the Kibbutz an aggregate of $12.2 in 2014, $10.8 million in 2013, and $10.3 million in 2012 (excludes VAT), as set forth in more detail below. The increase in the amount paid in 2014 is mainly as a result of payments timing. We believe that these services are rendered to us in the ordinary course of our business and that they represent terms no less favorable than those that would have been obtained from an unaffiliated third party. Nevertheless, a determination with respect to such matters requires subjective judgments regarding valuations, and regulators and other third parties may question whether our agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam are no less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. As described below, in March 2012, in connection with the closing of our IPO, certain of our agreements with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam terminated and a new set of agreements became effective. Under the Companies Law, our audit committee, board of directors and shareholders are required to approve every three years any extraordinary transaction in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest and that has a term of more than three years, unless the company’s audit committee, constituted in accordance with the Companies Law, determines, solely with respect to agreements that do not involve compensation to a controlling shareholder or his or her relatives, in connection with services rendered by any of them to the company or their employment with the company, that a longer term is reasonable under the circumstances. Our audit committee has determined that the term of all the agreements entered into between us and Kibbutz Sdot-Yam are reasonable under the relevant circumstances, except for part of our manpower agreement entered into between Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and us on January 1, 2011 as it relates to office holders, and the services agreement entered into between Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and us on July 20, 2011 (as amended). This requirement is relatively new, and there is uncertainty regarding its implementation. As a result, the agreements described below between us and Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, to the extent they are for a period that is greater than three years, may require re-approval in the future according to the Companies Law. References below to VAT are to the Israeli value added tax the rate for which is currently 18%. Land use agreement Our headquarters and research and development facilities, as well as one of our two manufacturing facilities, are located on the grounds at Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and include 31,644 square meter of facility and 55,207 square meter of un-covered yard. The headquarters and facilities are located on lands title to which is held by the ILA, and which are leased or subleased to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam pursuant to the following agreements: (i) a 49-year lease from the ILA signed in July 1978 that commenced in 1962 and expired in 2011 and has been extended pursuant to an option in the agreement for an additional 49 years, (ii) a lease from the ILA to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam that expired in 2009 and (iii) In April 2014 Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and the Caesarea Development Corporation entered into a new agreement pursuant to which Kibbutz Sdot-Yam leases the relevant premises (including such premises which are leased by the Kibbutz to us) from the Caesarea Development Corporation until year 2037. This agreement is subject to public recording procedure. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is currently negotiating a long-term lease agreement with the ILA to replace the second lease agreement referred to above. The ILA may terminate its leases with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam in certain circumstances, including if Kibbutz Sdot-Yam commences proceedings to disband or liquidate or in the event that Kibbutz Sdot-Yam ceases to be a “kibbutz” as defined in the lease (i.e., a registered cooperative society classified as a kibbutz). The ILA may, from time to time, change its regulations governing the lease agreements, and these changes could affect the terms of the land use agreement, as amended, including the provisions governing its termination. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam currently permits us to use the land and facilities pursuant to a land use agreement which became effective on April 1, 2012 and expires in 20 years. Under the land use agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam agreed to permit us to use approximately 100,000 square meters of land, consisting both of facilities and unbuilt areas, in consideration for an annual fee of NIS 12.6 million ($3.4 million) in 2012 and NIS 12.9 million ($3.5 million) in 2013 and thereafter. In each case plus VAT, and beginning in 2013, adjusted every six months based on any increase of the Israeli consumer price index compared to the index as of January 2011. The annual fee may be adjusted after January 1, 2021 or after January 1, 2018 if the Kibbutz is required to pay significantly higher lease fees to the ILA or Caesarea Development Corporation, and every three years thereafter if Kibbutz Sdot-Yam chooses to obtain an appraisal. The appraiser will be mutually agreed upon or, in the absence of agreement, will be chosen by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam out of the list of appraisers recommended at that time by Bank Leumi Le-Israel B.M. (“Bank Leumi”). Every addition or deletion of space is accounted for based on the original rates mentioned above. 87 Accordingly, starting from January 1, 2014 we are making use as needed of additional office space in Kibbutz Sdot-Yam of approximately 400 square meters, for a monthly fee of NIS 77,956 (approximately $20,000). Such additional area shall be used by us as long as we need it and not later than the end of the new land use agreement. We are currently negotiating a written addendum to the land lease agreement. Starting from September 2014, we use an additional approximately 9,000 square meters based on our needs and Kibbutz Sdot-Yam's consent under the same terms as the land use agreement, for an additional monthly fee of NIS 10,000 (approximately $2,570) which is not based on the original rates. However, we have the right to return these premises to Kibbutz Sdot Yam earlier, following a 90-day prior written notice. We are currently negotiating a written addendum to the land lease agreement. In addition, in the land use agreement, we have waived any claims for payment of NIS 18.0 million ($4.6 million) from Kibbutz Sdot-Yam with respect to prior investments in infrastructure on Kibbutz Sdot-Yam’s lands used by us under the prior land use agreement. Under the new land use agreement, we may not terminate the operation of either of our two production lines at our plant in Kibbutz Sdot-Yam as long as we continue to operate production lines elsewhere in Israel, and our headquarters must remain at Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. Furthermore, we may not decrease or return to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam any part of the land underlying the new land use agreement, except upon one year’s advance written notice with regards to a certain unbuilt area, subject to certain conditions. In addition, subject to limitations, we may be able to sublease lands. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam will have three months to accept or reject a request for sublease, in its sole discretion, provided that if it does not respond within such three-month period, then we will be entitled to sublease such lands to a person approved in advance by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. In such event, we will continue to be liable to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam with respect to such lands. Pursuant to the new land use agreement, subject to certain exceptions, if we need additional facilities on the land that we are permitted to use in Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, subject to obtaining the permits required by law, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam will build such facilities for us by using the proceeds of a loan that we will make to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, which loan shall be repaid to us by off-setting the monthly additional payment that we would pay for such new facilities and, if not fully repaid during the lease term, upon termination thereof. We have committed to fund the cost of the construction, up to a maximum of NIS 3.3 million ($0.8 million) plus VAT, required to change the access road leading to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and our facilities, such that the entrance to our facilities will be separated from the entrance into Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. In addition, we have committed to pay NIS 200,000 (approximately $51,000) plus VAT to cover the cost of paving an area of land leased from Kibbutz Sdot-Yam with such payment deducted in monthly installments over a four-year period beginning in 2013 from the lease payments to be made to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam under the land use agreement related to our Sdot-Yam facility. While Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is responsible under the agreement for obtaining various licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations necessary for use of the property, we have waived any monetary recourse against Kibbutz Sdot-Yam for failure to receive such licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations. Pursuant to an agreement dated January 4, 2012, for the settlement of reimbursement for building expenses incurred by us from January 2012, NIS 82,900 (approximately $24,000) and NIS 43,000 (approximately $12,000) will not be included in the land use fees until year 2020 and year 2015, respectively. Pursuant to these land use agreements, we paid to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam an aggregate of $3.9 million in 2014, $3.7 million in 2013, and $3.5 million in 2012. Manpower agreement In March 2001, we entered into a manpower agreement with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, which was amended in December 2006. Pursuant to the agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam agreed to provide us with labor services staffed by Kibbutz members, candidates for Kibbutz membership and Kibbutz residents (each a “Kibbutz Appointee”). The manpower agreement and its amendment from 2006 were terminated on December 31, 2010 and replaced by a new manpower agreement, signed on July 20, 2011, with a term of 10 years from January 1, 2011 that will be automatically renewed, unless one of the parties gives six months’ prior notice, for additional one-year periods. Our audit committee has determined that the term of the manpower agreement with Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is reasonable under the relevant circumstances expect as it relates to office holders. Accordingly, under the Companies Law, the manpower agreement, with respect to office holders, is subject to re-approval by our audit committee, board of directors and general meeting every three years. Under the new manpower agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam provides us with labor services staffed by Kibbutz Appointees. The consideration to be paid for each Kibbutz Appointee is based on our total cost of employment for a non-Kibbutz Appointee employee performing a similar role. Upon adjusting the costs of the current Kibbutz Appointee with a non-Kibbutz Appointee and maintaining several existing terms of engagement of Kibbutz Appointees, our total annual cost related to the engagement of Kibbutz members currently engaged by us increases by approximately NIS 0.7 million ($0.2 million). The number of Kibbutz Appointees may change in accordance with our needs. Under the new manpower agreement we will notify Kibbutz Sdot-Yam of any roles that require staffing, and if the Kibbutz offers candidates with skills similar to other candidates, we will give preference to the hiring of the relevant Kibbutz members. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is entitled under this new agreement, at its sole discretion, to discontinue the engagement of any Kibbutz Appointee of manpower services through his or her employment by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and require such appointee to become employed directly by us. Under the new manpower agreement, we will contribute monetarily to assist with the implementation of a professional reserve plan to encourage young Kibbutz members to obtain the necessary education for future employment with us. We will provide up to NIS 250,000 (approximately $64,000) per annum for this plan linked to changes in the Israeli consumer price index plus VAT. We will also implement a policy that prioritizes the hiring of such young Kibbutz members as our employees upon their graduation. The new manpower agreement also includes Kibbutz Sdot-Yam’s obligation to customary liability, insurance, indemnification and confidentiality and intellectual property provisions. 88 Pursuant to the manpower agreement, we paid to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam an aggregate of $3.9 million in 2014, $3.9 million in 2013, and $3.8 million in 2012. As of December 31, 2014, we engaged 72 Kibbutz Appointees on a permanent basis. Services agreement Pursuant to a services agreement between us and Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, signed on July 20, 2011 and amended on February 13, 2012, the Kibbutz provides us with sewage infrastructure services, water supply, meals, laundry, post-delivery and other services. The agreement is for term of eight years from the closing of our IPO in March 2012 and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods, unless one of the parties gives six months’ prior notice. Under the Israeli Companies Law, the services agreement is subject to re-approval as required by law. Under the agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam is granted a right of first refusal with respect to the services it provides under terms that we may obtain from third parties. The amount that we pay to the Kibbutz generally is determined based on the amount of services we consume. The amount we pay for services is subject to adjustment every six months for increases in the Israeli consumer price index. The new services agreement also includes Kibbutz Sdot-Yam’s obligation to customary liability, insurance and indemnification provisions. We are currently negotiating the renewal of the service agreement with the Kibbutz. Pursuant to the services agreement, we paid to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam an aggregate of $2.1 million in 2014, $2.1 million in 2013, and $2.1 million in 2012. Agreement for Arranging for Additional Accord Pursuant to the Agreement For Arranging For Additional Accord, signed on July 20, 2011, if we wish to acquire or lease any additional lands, whether on the grounds of our Bar-Lev manufacturing facility, or elsewhere in Israel, for the purpose of establishing new manufacturing facilities or production lines: (i) Kibbutz Sdot-Yam will purchase the land and build the required facilities’ structure on such land at its own expense in accordance with our needs; (ii) we will perform any necessary building adjustments at our expense; and (iii) Kibbutz Sdot-Yam will lease the land and the facility to us under a long-term lease agreement with terms to be negotiated in accordance with the then prevailing market price. In addition, under this agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam has agreed not to compete with us as long as it holds more than 10% of our shares. The agreement terminates on October 20, 2017. Agreement for Additional Land on the Grounds Near Our Bar-Lev Manufacturing Facility Pursuant to the Agreement For Arranging For Additional Accord, we entered into the Agreement For Additional Land, in August 2013, pursuant to which Kibbutz Sdot-Yam acquired additional land of approximately 13,000 square meters on the grounds near our Bar-Lev manufacturing facility, which we required in connection with the construction of the fifth production line at our Bar-Lev manufacturing facility and leased it to us at market value, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement For Arranging For Additional Accord. Under the agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam committed to (i) acquire the long-term leasing rights of the Additional Bar-Lev Land from the ILA (ii) acquire all permits and approvals required for performing the preparation work of the Additional Bar-Lev Land and for the building of the warehouse, (iii) perform such preparation work and construction, in conjunction with the administrative body of Bar-Lev industry park and other contractors according to our plans. The warehouse in Bar-Lev will be situated both on the current and new land. The financing of the building of the warehouse is to be made through a loan that will be granted by us to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, in the amount of the total cost related to the building of the warehouse, and such loan, including principle and interest, shall be repaid by setoff of the lease due to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam by us for our use of the warehouse. The principle amount of the loan will bear interest at a rate of 5.3% a year. 89 We have encountered a delay in the performance of this agreement and, as a result, we are incurring additional costs for storage at third parties’ facilities. Land purchase agreement and leaseback Pursuant to a land purchase agreement and leaseback signed on March 31, 2011 and amended on February 13, 2012 between Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and us, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam acquired from us in September 2012 our rights in the lands and facilities of the Bar-Lev Industrial Center in consideration for approximately NIS 43.7 million ($10.9 million). Pursuant to the land purchase agreement, we were required to obtain certain third-party consents from, among others, the Israeli Tax Authorities and from the Israeli Investment Center. All such consents have been obtained. The land purchase agreement was executed simultaneously with the execution of a land use agreement. Pursuant to the land use agreement, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam permits us to use the Bar-Lev Grounds for a period of ten years commencing in September 2012 that will be automatically renewed unless we give two years prior notice, for a ten-year term in consideration for an annual fee of NIS 4.1 million ($1.1 million) to be linked to the increase of the Israeli consumer price index. The fee is subject to adjustment following January 1, 2021 and every three years thereafter at the option of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam if the Kibbutz obtains an appraisal that supports such an increase. The appraiser will be mutually agreed upon or, in the absence of agreement, will be chosen by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam from a list of assessors recommended at that time by Bank Leumi. Under the land use agreement, we may not decrease or return to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam any part of the land underlying the land use agreement; however, subject to several limitations, we may be able to sublease such lands to a person approved in advance by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. In such event, we will continue to be liable to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam with respect to such lands. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, if we need additional facilities on the land that we are permitted to use by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, subject to obtaining the permits required by law, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam will build such facilities for us by using the proceeds of a loan that we will make to Kibbutz Sdot-Yam, which loan shall be repaid to us by off-setting the monthly additional payment that we would pay for such new facilities and, if not fully repaid during the lease term, upon termination thereof. Registration Rights Agreement Pursuant to a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), entered into on July 21, 2011 and amended on February 13, 2012, following our IPO in March 2012, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam has the right to request that we file a registration statement registering their shares, provided that the value of the shares to be registered is not less than $5.0 million, net of any underwriting discount or commission and provided further that we are not required to file more than two registration statements in any 12-month period. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam may also request that we file a registration statement on a Form F-3, if we are eligible to use such form, provided that the net value of the shares to be registered is not less than $1.0 million and provided further that we are not required to file more than two registration statements on a Form F-3 in any 12-month period. Kibbutz Sdot-Yam has piggyback registration rights, which provide it with the right to register their shares in the event of an offering of securities by us. To the extent that the underwriters limit the number of shares that can be included in a registration statement, we have discretion to register those shares we choose first, followed by the shares of Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we registered 2,300,000 of our ordinary shares held by Kibbutz Sdot-Yam. These registration rights terminate upon the earlier of seven years following the date of our IPO or the date that a holder of registration rights can sell its shares freely under Rule 144 without restrictions on volume. Originally, the Registration Rights Agreement was executed by and between us, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and Tene. In April 2013, Tene and Kibbutz Sdot-Yam sold 7,623,930 of our ordinary shares. In June 2014, Kibbutz Sdot-Yam sold 6,325,000 of the then-17,765,000 ordinary Company shares it owned. Relationship and agreements with Canadian Quartz Holdings Inc. In September 2010, we signed an agreement to establish a joint venture, Caesarstone Canada Inc., with our distributor in Eastern Canada, Ciot. The final closing occurred on October 15, 2010, and the commencement of Caesarstone Canada Inc.’s operations occurred in mid-October. We hold a 55% ownership interest in the joint venture with Ciot holding the remaining ownership interest. The approval of both shareholders is required for certain corporate actions by the joint venture, including reducing the selling price of the joint venture’s products below a certain level. The joint venture has entered into a services agreement with Ciot pursuant to which Ciot is required to provide logistical and support services to the joint venture. Ciot may terminate the services agreement for any reason by providing the joint venture with at least 12 months prior written notice. 90 Caesarstone Canada Inc. is also obligated to distribute 30% of its profits per year as a dividend to its shareholders unless shareholder approval is obtained. In addition, we granted Ciot a put option and Ciot granted us a call option for its interest each exercisable any time between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2023. Exercise of the put option requires six months prior notice, and if Ciot exercises such option in the future, we will be required to make a cash payment to them. Exercise of the call option does not require prior notice. The different purchase prices of each option following such an exercise is to be calculated based on the corporate value of Caesarstone Canada Inc. according to a formula that includes the number of slabs sold by Caesarstone Canada Inc. and the price per slab for Caesarstone Canada Inc. In January 2011, a loan in the amount of CAD 4.0 million was made to Caesarstone Canada Inc. by its shareholders, Ciot and ourselves, on a pro rata basis. Agreements with directors and officers Employment agreements See “ITEM 6.B: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Compensation of Officers and Directors—Employment and consulting agreements with executive officers”. Indemnification agreements See “ITEM 6.C: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Board Practices—Exculpation, insurance and indemnification of office holders.” Agreement with Poland distributer In 2014, we entered into an exclusive distribution engagement with a distribution company in Poland, controlled by Mr. Oren Ohana, the son of Mr. Maxim Ohana, the chairman of our board of directors. The transaction was approved by our board of directors, following the approval of our audit committee in accordance with our related party transactions policy and the requirements of the Companies Law, considering, among others, that the terms of engagement with such distributor are similar to the terms of engagement with other comparable third parties distributers of ours, and that the engagement was made in the ordinary course of business and on market terms. This transaction is not material to us. c. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. ITEM 8: Financial Information a. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information Consolidated Financial Statements For our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, please see pages F-4 to F-70 of this report. Legal Proceedings Arbitration proceeding with Microgil Agricultural Cooperative Society Ltd. In November 2011, Kfar Giladi and Microgil, an entity we believe is controlled by Kfar Giladi, initiated arbitration proceedings against us that commenced in April 2012. We refer to Kfar Giladi and Microgil as the “claimants.” The claimants filed a complaint with the arbitrator against us seeking damages of NIS 232.8 million ($59.9 million) and in August 2012, we filed a complaint with the arbitrator against the claimants seeking damages of NIS 76.6 million ($19.7 million). After the claimants filed their affidavits in the arbitration we learned that it took illegal actions in order to obtain evidence. We consider these actions to be a breach of the arbitration clause and accordingly informed the claimants that the arbitration was cancelled. We submitted a claim to the court seeking a declarative judgment that the arbitration’s cancellation was lawful. We also submitted a motion to the court asking to stay the arbitration until the motion claim is adjudicated. We believe that we are entitled to cancel the arbitration under the circumstances described above, but our position is disputed by the claimants, and there is no assurance that we will succeed in the claim or the application. 91 The arbitration arises out of a dispute related to the Processing Agreement that we entered into with Kfar Giladi (which subsequently purportedly assigned it to Microgil) in June 2006 pursuant to which Kfar Giladi committed to establish a production facility at its own expense within 21 months of the date of the Processing Agreement to process quartz for us and for other potential customers. Pursuant to the Processing Agreement, we committed to pay fixed prices for quartz processing services related to agreed-upon quantities of quartz over a period of ten years from the date set for the claimants to commence operating the production facility. We estimate that the total amount of such payments would have been approximately $55 million. It is our position that the production facility established by the claimants was not operational until approximately two years after the date required by the Processing Agreement. As a result, we were unable to purchase the minimum quantities set forth in the Processing Agreement and we therefore acquired the quantities of ground quartz that we needed from other quartz suppliers. It is also our position, which is disputed by the claimants, that the Processing Agreement was terminated by us following its breach by the claimants. We contend that our purchases of ground quartz from Microgil in 2010 and 2011 were made pursuant to new understandings reached between the parties and not pursuant to the Processing Agreement. The claimants allege that the Processing Agreement was still in effect and that we did not meet our contractual commitments under the Processing Agreement to order the minimum annual quantity. In addition, once production began, we contend that the claimants failed to consistently deliver the required quantity and quality of ground quartz as agreed by the parties. We also contend that the claimants are responsible for not returning to us unprocessed quartz that we provided to them, including quartz that is currently in the claimants’ possession and additional quartz that is unaccounted for. Each party has various other claims against the other. In January 2012, Microgil notified us that it had closed its production facility as a result of our breach of the Processing Agreement. In April 2012, the claimants filed a claim with the arbitrator against us for NIS 232.8 million ($59.9 million) for alleged damages and losses incurred by them in connection with a breach of the Processing Agreement by us; we are disputing such a breach by us. In August 2012, we filed a claim against the claimants in arbitration for NIS 76.6 million ($19.7 million) for damages incurred by us in connection with Microgil’s malfunctioning operations, Microgil’s breach of the Processing Agreement and the understanding between the parties regarding the agreement after it was terminated, inventory which was not returned to us and was unaccounted for and an unpaid loan, which was granted by us to the claimants. We intend to defend the arbitration vigorously and to seek damages from Microgil for damage caused to us. However, we cannot provide any assurance that an adverse ruling or a negative outcome will not have a material adverse effect on us. Claim by former South African distributor In December 2007, we terminated our agency agreement with our former South African agent, WOMAG, on the basis that it had breached the agreement. In the same month, we filed a claim for NIS 1.0 million ($0.3 million) in the Israeli District Court in Haifa based on such breach. WOMAG has contested jurisdiction of the Israeli District Court, but subsequent appellate courts have dismissed WOMAG’s contest. In January 2008, WOMAG filed suit in South Africa seeking EURO 15.7 million ($19.1 million). In September 2013, the South African Court determined that since a proceeding on the same facts was pending before another court (lis alibis pendens), the South African Court would stay the matter until the conclusion of the Israeli action. In December 2013, the magistrate’s court in Israel held that we were not entitled to terminate the agreement with WOMAG as it was not breached by WOMAG. We have filed an appeal on this judgment to the district court, which was denied by the court. The case in the South African Court is to proceed to trial. Although we intend to vigorously defend the case in the South African court, we believe that we recorded an adequate reserve for this claim. Claims related to alleged silicosis injuries Overview We are subject to a number of claims in Israel by fabricators or their employees alleging that they contracted illnesses, including silicosis, through exposure to silica particles during cutting, polishing, sawing, grinding, breaking, crushing, drilling, sanding or sculpting our products. Silicosis is an occupational lung disease that is progressive and sometimes fatal, and is characterized by scarring of the lungs and damage to the breathing function. Inhalation of dust containing fine silica particles as a result of poorly protected and controlled, or unprotected and uncontrolled, exposure while working in different occupations, including among other things, processing quartz, granite, marble and other materials and working with quartz can cause silicosis. Silica comprises approximately 90% of engineered stones, including our products, and smaller concentrations of silica are present in natural stones and, therefore, fabrication of engineered stones may create higher exposure to silica dust and, accordingly, may cause a higher risk of silicosis. 92 Individual Claims As of today, we are party to 60 pending claims of bodily injury that have been filed against us directly since 2008 in Israel or that have named us as third-party defendants by fabricators or their employees in Israel, by the injured successors, by the State of Israel, or by others. Such lawsuits include one lawsuit filed by the Israeli NII which was filed with respect to three individuals who filed personal claims against us and one lawsuit where the claimants applied for its class certification. Of 63 claims that had been filed against us, including the 60 pending claims, 62 were filed in Israel and one in the United States, two claims were settled and one claim which was filed in the United States was dismissed, as further detailed below. Out of the 63 claims mentioned above, one claim was filed in 2008, two in 2009, four in 2010, seven in 2011, eight in 2012, eight in 2013, 28 in 2014 and five in 2015 through the filing of this annual report. As of today, we have also received ten letters threatening to file claims against us on behalf of certain fabricators in Israel or their employees in Israel alleging that they contracted illnesses as a result of fabricating our products. Each of the claims named other defendants, such as fabricators that employed the plaintiffs, the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Employment, distributors of our products and insurance companies. The pending claims include one lawsuit filed with a petition to be certified as class action, one lawsuit filed by three stone fabricators together and one appeal which was filed in connection with a judgment granted in one of the lawsuits (as further detailed below). In addition, one claim was filed by the NII for subrogation of compensation paid by the NII to certain fabricators who allegedly contracted silicosis. Various arguments are raised in the claims, including, among others, product liability arguments and failure to provide warnings regarding the risks associated with silica dust generated by the fabrication of our products. Most of the claims do not specify a total amount of damages sought, as the plaintiff’s future damages will be determined at trial; however, damages totaling approximately $22.3 million are specified in 55 of the claims currently pending against us in Israel (excluding the claim that is seeking class action recognition). A claim filed with the magistrates court in Israel is limited to a maximum of NIS 2.5 million (approximately $642 thousands) plus any fees, and among the 60 pending claims filed against us in Israel, 35 claims were filed in the magistrates court. A claim filed in the district court is not subject to such limitation. As a result, there is uncertainty regarding the total amount of damages that may ultimately be claimed We intend to vigorously contest pending claims against us, although there can be no assurance that we will succeed in these claims and there is a reasonable possibility that we will be liable for damages in such lawsuits. We currently estimate our total reasonably possible exposure with respect to 47 pending lawsuits (other than the lawsuits filed with a motion to be recognized as a class action) to be approximately $12.1 million, although the actual result of such lawsuits may significantly vary from such estimate. As of today, only one claim was resolved by an Israeli District court, imposing liability of 40% on the self-employed plaintiff and dividing the remaining 60% liability between the State of Israel and us, with 55% imposed on us and 45% on the State of Israel. That judgment was appealed to the Supreme Court by the plaintiff, the State of Israel and us. Israeli law, as well as the law of other jurisdictions, recognizes joint and several liability among co-defendants in civil suits. In cases where co-defendants are found liable, the plaintiff is entitled to collect all damages from only one of the liable defendants. Thus, even if we are found only partially liable to a plaintiff’s damages, the plaintiff may seek to collect all his damages from us, requiring us to collect separately from our co-defendants their allocated portion of the damages. If defendants are insolvent or we are unsuccessful in collecting their portion of the damages for any other reason, we may incur damages beyond the damages we are liable for. We currently estimate that contingent losses related to the pending claims mentioned above are no more than reasonably possible. In addition, we believe that an adverse outcome to the claims filed against us to date (other than the class action) would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, in part, due to the current availability of insurance coverage; however, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that we will prevail in these cases. Class Action Claim A lawsuit by a single plaintiff and a motion for its class certification were filed against us in April 2014 in the Central District Court in Israel. The plaintiff claims to be the owner of a fabrication plant and to have contracted silicosis as a result of fabricating our products. In connection therewith, the plaintiff claims that we did not provide adequate warnings with respect to the risks and protection measures required with respect to fabrication of our products, and that we intentionally hid and did not warn about the high risk and irreversible damages that may occur to the persons processing our products and misled the fabricators in Israel by comparing the hazards related to the fabrication of our products to those associated with the fabrication of natural stones. In acting so, the plaintiff claims that we did not act as a reasonable manufacturer; we violated the law and Israeli standards, committed an assault, acted negligently and are liable under the Israeli Law for Liability for Defective Products, 1980. The plaintiff also claims that our products are a “dangerous item” under the Israeli Tort Ordinance, 5728-1968 and, therefore, the plaintiff claims that the burden of proof falls on us to prove that there was no carelessness for which we are liable in connection with our products. The plaintiff claims that by our wrongful conduct we violated the plaintiff’s freedom to choose whether to be exposed to the risks associated with the fabrication of our products. 93 The plaintiff alleges that, if the lawsuit is recognized as a class action, the claim against us is estimated to be NIS 216 million (approximately $56 million), calculated by claiming damages of NIS 18,000 ($4,628) for each individual who worked in fabrication workshops in Israel in fabrication or administrative roles and who have been exposed to dust generated by the fabrication of our products. The plaintiff claims that there are 12,000 such individuals who worked at 400 fabrication workshops in Israel, each of which employed 10 fabricators and five administrative persons, with one rotation during the relevant period. In addition, such claim includes an unstated sum in compensation for special and general damages, such as medical disability, functional disability, pain and suffering, medical expenses, medical and nursing assistance, which will require proof and quantification for each injured person in the purported class action. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to compel us to notify the alleged group (and potential members of the group) and each individual about the risks, recommending that they undertake a medical examination and assert their rights. We intend to vigorously contest recognition of the lawsuit as a class action and to defend the lawsuit on its merits, although, considering the preliminary stage of this lawsuit, there can be no assurance as to the probability of success or the range of potential exposure, if any. December 2013 Judgment In December 2013, a judgment was entered by the Central District Court of Israel in one of the lawsuits, according to which we were found to be comparatively liable for 33% of the plaintiff's total damages. The remaining liability was imposed on the plaintiff at 40%, as contributory negligence, and on the Israeli Ministry of Industry at 27%. The total damages of the plaintiff were found by the court to be NIS 5.3 million ($1.4 million). Since the plaintiff received payments from the NII, such payments were subtracted from the total damages after reduction of the damages contributed to the plaintiff's contributory negligence. However, under Israeli law, under certain condition a plaintiff may be awarded as compensation from third party injurers, other than his employer, at least 25% of the damages claimed even if the payments that the plaintiff received from the NII equal or exceed the actual damages of the plaintiff after deducting his contributory liability. Accordingly, in the above claim, the court awarded the plaintiff additional compensation of approximately NIS 800,000 ($0.2 million) plus legal fees and expenses, which reflected 25% of the plaintiff actual damages, after deducting the plaintiff's contributory negligence and the amount of NIS 3.3 million ($0.8 million) to which the claimant is entitled from the NII. After giving effect to the Israeli Ministry of Industry’s comparative responsibility, the total liability imposed on us in this case was NIS 436,669 ($0.1 million) plus the claimant’s legal expenses. Such amount was fully paid by our insurer in January 2014 (apart from our deductible). We, as well as the Israeli Ministry of Industry and the plaintiff, appealed on the judgment to the Israeli Supreme Court. There is no assurance whether we or any of the other appellant shall succeed in the appeals. Claim by Former Employee One of the fabricators who filed a claim against us was employed by us in the past and claimed that his illness was, in part, the result of his employment with us. Although there can be no assurance that we will succeed in such claim, we believe that his illness is not related to his employment by us. We are not currently subject to any other claim from our employees related to silicosis; however we may be subject to such claims in the future. Our employers’ liability insurance policy excludes silicosis claims by our employees, and to the extent we become subject to any such claims, we may face claims in excess of the portion covered by the NII. Settled Claims We were also a party to two settlement agreements that had been approved by a court with respect to two of the claims filed. In one case, the total settlement was for NIS 275,000 (approximately $71,000) of which we had agreed to pay NIS 10,000 (approximately $3,000) without admitting liability. Substantially all of the balance was payable by the fabricator that employed the individual in question and insurance companies. In the other case, the total settlement was for NIS 130,000 (approximately $33,000) of which we agreed to pay NIS 80,000 (approximately $21,000). The balance was payable by the fabricator that employed the deceased plaintiff. 94 We can provide no assurance that other lawsuits will be settled in this manner or at all. Dismissed U.S. Claim In 2012, Caesarstone USA was added as a 26th defendant approximately one year after commencement of a lawsuit bodily injury claim in the United States by a fabricator in the United States. The other 25 defendants were manufacturers of equipment utilized in stone fabricating or finishing operations or manufacturers and marketers of stone and engineered stone products. Total damages of approximately $56 million, including approximately $20 million of punitive damages, were sought in the U.S. claim. The case was ultimately dismissed and we were removed as a defendant. Insurance We currently have product liability insurance in Israel, which applies to claims that may be submitted against us worldwide during the insurance policy term and our Australian, and U.S. subsidiaries have product liability insurance in Australia, and the United States, respectively, covering their activities. Our product liability insurance, currently covers claims that are submitted worldwide during the insurance policy term up to an amount of $20 million per claim and per insurance policy term, plus legal fees and litigation costs in three layers. Commencing in 2008, we had five consecutive insurance policies in Israel, effective for periods of 12 to 18 months. We believe that our current insurance covers the pending individual product liability claims; however, with respect to the claim which was required to be recognized as a class action, our insurer has notified us that our product liability insurance covers such claim only partially. Although, it is our position that such class action is fully covered by our product liability insurance, but subject to the coverage amount limit and to the insurer position, there is no certainty whether our insurance would also cover the class action. In addition, the amount claimed in the currently pending class action exceeds our insurance coverage by a material amount. Our product liability insurance includes coverage of up to $20 million, plus legal fees and litigation costs. The coverage includes (i) coverage of $5 million provided by an Israeli insurer, which initially insured us for $10 million beginning in March 2014 and then reduced the coverage to $5 million in July 2014 (the “first layer”), (ii) additional coverage of $5 million (the "second layer") in excess of the first layer, and (iii) an additional excess layer of $10 million in excess of the first layer and second layer, starting from July 2014 (the "third layer"). Our product liability insurance policy is effective until March 31 2015. Our current product liability insurance policy includes a double-rate premium compared to our prior year insurance and a deductible of $125,000 per claim that was applied within the renewed policy term, instead of a $5,000 deductible applied previously. The second and third layers apply only for illnesses discovered after February 2010. Our first layer insurer has informed us that the first layer of coverage will not be renewed as of March 31, 2015. Although we will seek to renew our product liability insurance to cover silicosis related claims, there is no assurance that we will be successful. We believe that our current insurance in Israel covers the pending individual product liability claims; however with respect to the claim brought in April 2014 where the plaintiff applied for class certification, our insurer has notified us that our product liability insurance covers such claim only partially. While we believe that such class action is fully covered by our product liability insurance policy, subject to the coverage amount limit, there is no certainty whether our insurance would also cover the class action. In addition, as discussed below, the amount claimed in the currently pending class action exceeds our insurance coverage by a material amount. In the event that we are unable to renew our insurance at all or in part, we are unable to obtain coverage from other insurance providers, we cannot obtain insurance on as favorable terms as previously, our insurance is terminated early, our insurance coverage is decreased, our insurance coverage inadequately covers damages for which we are found liable, or we become subject to silicosis claims excluded by our employer liability insurance policy, we may incur significant legal expenses and become liable for damages, in each case, that are not covered by insurance, and our management could expend significant time addressing such claims. Such events might have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our employer liability insurance excludes silicosis damages and, therefore, in case that we are found liable for any of our employees’ illness with silicosis, we will have to bear compensation for such damages, which might have adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Claim by the Israel Ministry of the Protection of the Environment related to alleged violation of the Clean Air Law, 2008 In December 2013, we completed the installation of a system in our Bar-Lev manufacturing facility to reduce styrene emission and following which we have better control of the styrene emission in our Bar-Lev manufacturing facility and we presented to IMPE a plan to further improve our control of styrene emission and comply with the styrene gas emission standards. With respect to our Sdot-Yam manufacturing facility the IMPE summoned us in January 2014 to a hearing to address allegations that, based on the IMPE’s procurement of several gas emission samplings, we exceeded the air ambient standards. Following the hearing, and although the IMPE acknowledged that we were in the process of installing measures to comply with the styrene gas emission standards, the IMPE recommended an investigation to look into allegations that we exceeded from the threshold of styrene air ambient standards during 2013. During 2014, we implemented measures to correct the styrene air ambient standards which we believe should help to remediate excessive emission of styrene gas. Our constant controlling of styrene emission levels requires strict maintenance and compliance with work processes. 95 General From time to time, we are involved in other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business related to a range of matters, including environmental, contract, employment claims, product liability and warranty claims, and claims related to modification and adjustment or replacement of product surfaces sold. While the outcome of these other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any such claims will have a material adverse effect on us, either individually or in the aggregate. See Note 11 of the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Dividends On December 23, 2014, we paid a dividend of $20.0 million to our shareholders. On December 11, 2013, we paid a dividend to our shareholders of $20.1 million. Previously, on April 4, 2012, we paid a special dividend of $26.4 million to our prior shareholders (Kibbutz Sdot-Yam and Tene) following the closing of our IPO in March 2012, and an additional dividend of $0.8 million to our preferred shareholders. We paid dividends equating to $14.0 million in fiscal year 2010 and $6.9 million in fiscal year 2011. All dividends prior to the 2013 one were denominated in NIS and have been translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate prevailing on the date each dividend was distributed. We currently expect that payments of dividends will be made from time to time based on the recommendation of our board of directors, after taking into account legal limitations, growth plans and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We do not have a declared dividend policy although we may adopt one in the future. Under Israeli law, we may declare and pay dividends only if, upon the determination of our board of directors, there is no reasonable concern that the distribution will prevent us from being able to meet the terms of our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. The distribution of dividends is further limited by Israeli law to the greater of retained earnings and earnings generated over the two most recent years. In the event that we do not have retained earnings or earnings generated over the two most recent years legally available for distribution, we may seek the approval of the court to distribute a dividend. The court may approve our request if it is convinced that there is no reasonable concern that a payment of a dividend will prevent us from satisfying our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. To the extent we declare a dividend, we do not intend to distribute dividends from earnings related to our Approved/Beneficiary Enterprise programs. The taxable income exemption provided under the Approved/Beneficiary Enterprise program is valid exclusively for undistributed earnings, and as a result, a distribution of earnings related to our Approved/Beneficiary Enterprise programs would subject us to additional tax payments upon a distribution of these earnings as dividends. The payment of dividends may be subject to Israeli withholding taxes. See “ITEM 10.E: Additional Information—Taxation—Israeli tax considerations and government programs—Taxation of our shareholders—Dividends”. b.

ITEM 10: Additional Information a. Share Capital Not applicable. b. Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association Our authorized share capital consists of 200,000,000 ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.04 per share, of which 35,133,568 are issued and outstanding as of February 28, 2015. Our ordinary shares are not redeemable and do not have preemptive rights. The ownership or voting of ordinary shares by non-residents of Israel is not restricted in any way by our articles of association or the laws of the State of Israel, except for anti-terror legislation and except that citizens of countries which are in a state of war with Israel may not be recognized as owners of ordinary shares. Our prior articles were replaced in March 2012 by new articles of association and at which time all of our issued and outstanding preferred shares converted into ordinary shares. In February 2014, our articles were amended. The description below is a summary of the material provisions of our new articles of association and of the Companies Law. Voting Holders of our ordinary shares have one vote for each ordinary share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders at a shareholder meeting. Shareholders may vote at shareholder meetings either in person, by proxy or, with respect to certain resolutions, by a voting instrument. Israeli law does not allow public companies to adopt shareholder resolutions by means of written consent in lieu of a shareholder meeting. Shareholder voting rights may be affected by the grant of any special voting rights to the holders of a class of shares with preferential rights that may be authorized in the future. Transfer of shares Fully paid ordinary shares are issued in registered form and may be freely transferred under our articles of association unless the transfer is restricted or prohibited by another instrument, Israeli law or the rules of a stock exchange on which the shares are traded. Election of directors Our ordinary shares do not have cumulative voting rights for the election of directors. Rather, under our articles of association our directors are elected by the holders of a simple majority of our ordinary shares at a general shareholder meeting (excluding abstentions). See “ITEM 6.C: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Board Practices—Board of directors and officers.” As a result, the holders of our ordinary shares that represent more than 50% of the voting power represented at a shareholder meeting and voting thereon (excluding abstentions) have the power to elect any or all of our directors whose positions are being filled at that meeting, subject to the special approval requirements for external directors described under “ITEM 6.C: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Board Practices—External Directors.” Dividend and liquidation rights Under Israeli law, we may declare and pay dividends only if, upon the determination of our board of directors, there is no reasonable concern that the distribution will not prevent us from being able to meet the terms of our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. Under the Companies Law, the distribution amount is further limited to the greater of retained earnings or earnings generated over the two most recent years legally available for distribution. In the event that we do not have retained earnings or earnings generated over the two most recent years legally available for distribution, we may seek the approval of the court in order to distribute a dividend. The court may approve our request if it is convinced that there is no reasonable concern that the payment of a dividend will prevent us from satisfying our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. 98 In the event of our liquidation, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, our assets will be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares on a pro-rata basis. Dividend and liquidation rights may be affected by the grant of preferential dividend or distribution rights to the holders of a class of shares with preferential rights that may be authorized in the future. Shareholder meetings We are required to convene an annual general meeting of our shareholders once every calendar year within a period of not more than 15 months following the preceding annual general meeting. Our board of directors may convene a special general meeting of our shareholders and is required to do so at the request of two directors or one quarter of the members of our board of directors, or at the request of one or more holders of 5% or more of our share capital and 1% of our voting power, or the holder or holders of 5% or more of our voting power. All shareholder meetings require prior notice of at least 14 days and, in certain cases, 35 days. The chairman of our board of directors presides over our general meetings. However, if there is no such chairman or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within 15 minutes after the appointed time, or is unwilling to act as chairman, then the board members present at the meeting shall choose one of the board members as chairman of the meeting and if they shall not do so then the shareholders present shall choose a board member, or if no board member is present or if all the board members present decline to take the chair, they shall choose any other person present to be chairman of the meeting. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, shareholders entitled to participate and vote at general meetings are the shareholders of record on a date to be decided by the board of directors, which may be between four and 40 days prior to the date of the meeting, depending on the type of meeting and whether written proxies are being used. Quorum Pursuant to our articles of association, the quorum required for a meeting of shareholders consists of at least two shareholders present in person, by proxy or by a voting instrument, who hold at least 25% of our voting power. A meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum generally is adjourned one week thereafter at the same time and place, or to such other day, time and place, as our board of directors may indicate in the invitation to the meeting or in the notice of the meeting to the shareholders. Pursuant to the Companies Law, at the reconvened meeting, the meeting will take place with whatever number of participants are present, unless the meeting was called pursuant to a request by our shareholders, in which case the quorum required is the number of shareholders required to call the meeting as described under “—Shareholder meetings.” Resolutions Under the Companies Law, unless otherwise provided in the articles of association or applicable law, all resolutions of the shareholders require a simple majority of the voting rights represented at the meeting, in person, by proxy or, with respect to certain resolutions, by a voting instrument, and voting on the resolution (excluding abstentions). A resolution for the voluntary winding up of the company requires the approval by the holders of 75% of the voting rights represented at the meeting, in person, by proxy and voting on the resolution (excluding abstentions). The grant of equity based awards to our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, and any compensation to our Chief Executive Officer are additionally subject to any approval required by applicable law and to the affirmative vote in favor of such grants of at least 75% of our directors then in office. Access to corporate records Under the Companies Law, all shareholders generally have the right to review minutes of our general meetings, our shareholder register and register of significant shareholders (as defined in the Companies Law), our articles of association, our financial statements, other documents as provided in the Companies Law, and any document we are required by law to file publicly with the Israeli Companies Registrar or with the Israel Securities Authority. Any shareholder who specifies the purpose of its request may request to review any document in our possession that relates to: (i) any action or transaction with a related party which requires shareholder approval under the Companies Law; or (ii) the approval, by the board of directors, of an action in which an office holder has a personal interest. We may deny a request to review a document if we determine that the request was not made in good faith, that the document contains a commercial secret or a patent or that the document’s disclosure may otherwise impair our interests. Acquisitions under Israeli law Full tender offer A person wishing to acquire shares of an Israeli public company and who would as a result hold over 90% of the target company’s issued and outstanding share capital is required by the Companies Law to make a tender offer to all of the company’s shareholders for the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the company. 99 A person wishing to acquire shares of an Israeli public company and who would as a result hold over 90% of the issued and outstanding share capital of a certain class of shares is required to make a tender offer to all of the shareholders who hold shares of the same class for the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the same class. If the shareholders who do not respond to or accept the offer hold less than 5% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the applicable class of the shares, and more than half of the shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the offer accept the offer, all of the shares that the acquirer offered to purchase will be transferred to the acquirer by operation of law. However, a tender offer will be accepted if the shareholders who do not accept it hold less than 2% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the applicable class of the shares. Upon a successful completion of such a full tender offer, any shareholder that was an offeree in such tender offer, whether such shareholder accepted the tender offer or not, may, within six months from the date of acceptance of the tender offer, petition the Israeli court to determine whether the tender offer was for less than fair value and that the fair value should be paid as determined by the court. However, under certain conditions, the offeror may determine in the terms of the tender offer that an offeree who accepted the offer will not be entitled to petition the Israeli court as described above. If the shareholders who did not respond or accept the tender offer hold at least 5% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the applicable class, the acquirer may not acquire shares of the company that will increase its holdings to more than 90% of the company’s issued and outstanding share capital or of the applicable class from shareholders who accepted the tender offer. The description above regarding a full tender offer shall also apply, with necessary changes, when a full tender offer is accepted and the offeror has also offered to acquire all of the company’s securities. Special tender offer The Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares of an Israeli public company must be made by means of a special tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a holder of at least 25% of the voting rights in the company. This rule does not apply if there is already another holder of at least 25% of the voting rights in the company. Similarly, the Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a special tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company, if there is no other shareholder of the company who holds more than 45% of the voting rights in the company. These requirements do not apply if the acquisition (i) occurs in the context of a private offering, on the condition that the shareholders’ meeting approved the acquisition as a private offering whose purpose is to give the acquirer at least 25% of the voting rights in the company if there is no person who holds at least 25% of the voting rights in the company, or as a private offering whose purpose is to give the acquirer 45% of the voting rights in the company, if there is no person who holds 45% of the voting rights in the company; (ii) was from a shareholder holding at least 25% of the voting rights in the company and resulted in the acquirer becoming a holder of at least 25% of the voting rights in the company; or (iii) was from a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company and resulted in the acquirer becoming a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company. The special tender offer may be consummated only if (i) at least 5% of the voting power attached to the company’s outstanding shares will be acquired by the offeror and (ii) the special tender offer is accepted by a majority of the votes of those offerees who gave notice of their position in respect of the offer; in counting the votes of offerees, the votes of a holder of control in the offeror, a person who has personal interest in acceptance of the special tender offer, a holder of at least 25% of the voting rights in the company, or any person acting on their or on the offeror’s behalf, including their relatives or companies under their control, are not taken into account. In the event that a special tender offer is made, a company’s board of directors is required to express its opinion on the advisability of the offer or shall abstain from expressing any opinion if it is unable to do so, provided that it gives the reasons for its abstention. An office holder in a target company who, in his or her capacity as an office holder, performs an action the purpose of which is to cause the failure of an existing or foreseeable special tender offer or is to impair the chances of its acceptance, is liable to the potential purchaser and shareholders for damages resulting from his acts, unless such office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to believe he or she was acting for the benefit of the company. However, office holders of the target company may negotiate with the potential purchaser in order to improve the terms of the special tender offer, and may further negotiate with third parties in order to obtain a competing offer. 100 If a special tender offer was accepted by a majority of the shareholders who announced their stand on such offer, then shareholders who did not respond to the special offer or had objected to the special tender offer may accept the offer within four days of the last day set for the acceptance of the offer. In the event that a special tender offer is accepted, then the purchaser or any person or entity controlling it and any corporation controlled by them shall refrain from making a subsequent tender offer for the purchase of shares of the target company and may not execute a merger with the target company for a period of one year from the date of the offer, unless the purchaser or such person or entity undertook to effect such an offer or merger in the initial special tender offer. Merger The Companies Law permits merger transactions if approved by each party’s board of directors and, unless certain requirements described under the Companies Law are met, a majority of each party’s shareholders, by a majority of each party’s shares that are voted on the proposed merger at a shareholders’ meeting. The board of directors of a merging company is required pursuant to the Companies Law to discuss and determine whether in its opinion there exists a reasonable concern that as a result of a proposed merger, the surviving company will not be able to satisfy its obligations towards its creditors, taking into account the financial condition of the merging companies. If the board of directors has determined that such a concern exists, it may not approve a proposed merger. Following the approval of the board of directors of each of the merging companies, the boards of directors must jointly prepare a merger proposal for submission to the Israeli Registrar of Companies. For purposes of the shareholder vote, unless a court rules otherwise, the merger will not be deemed approved if a majority of the shares voting at the shareholders meeting (excluding abstentions) that are held by parties other than the other party to the merger, any person who holds 25% or more of the means of control (See “ITEM 6.C: Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Board Practices—Audit committee—Approval of transactions with related parties” for a definition of means of control) of the other party to the merger or any one on their behalf including their relatives (See “ITEM 6.C: Directors, Senior Management and Employees— Board Practices—External directors—Qualifications of external directors” for a definition of relatives) or corporations controlled by any of them, vote against the merger. In addition, if the non-surviving entity of the merger has more than one class of shares, the merger must be approved by each class of shareholders. If the transaction would have been approved but for the separate approval of each class of shares or the exclusion of the votes of certain shareholders as provided above, a court may still rule that the company has approved the merger upon the request of holders of at least 25% of the voting rights of a company, if the court holds that the merger is fair and reasonable, taking into account the appraisal of the merging companies’ value and the consideration offered to the shareholders. Under the Companies Law, each merging company must send a copy of the proposed merger plan to its secured creditors. Unsecured creditors are entitled to receive notice of the merger, as provided by the regulations promulgated under the Companies Law. Upon the request of a creditor of either party to the proposed merger, the court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there exists a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will be unable to satisfy the obligations of the target company. The court may also give instructions in order to secure the rights of creditors. In addition, a merger may not be completed unless at least 50 days have passed from the date that a proposal for approval of the merger was filed with the Israeli Registrar of Companies and 30 days from the date that shareholder approval of both merging companies was obtained. Anti-takeover measures The Companies Law allows us to create and issue shares having rights different from those attached to our ordinary shares, including shares providing certain preferred or additional rights to voting, distributions or other matters and shares having preemptive rights. We do not have any authorized or issued shares other than ordinary shares. In the future, if we do create and issue a class of shares other than ordinary shares, such class of shares, depending on the specific rights that may be attached to them, may delay or prevent a takeover or otherwise prevent our shareholders from realizing a potential premium over the market value of their ordinary shares. The authorization of a new class of shares will require an amendment to our articles of association which requires the prior approval of a majority of our shares represented and voting at a general meeting. Shareholders voting at such a meeting will be subject to the restrictions under the Companies Law described in “—Voting.” 101 Tax law Israeli tax law treats some acquisitions, such as stock-for-stock swaps between an Israeli company and a foreign company, less favorably than U.S. tax law. For example, Israeli tax law may subject a shareholder who exchanges ordinary shares in an Israeli company for shares in a non-Israeli corporation to immediate taxation unless such shareholder receives an advanced ruling from the Israeli Tax Authority for different tax treatment. See “ITEM 10.E: Additional Information—Taxation—Israeli tax considerations and government programs—Taxation of our shareholders—Capital gains”. Changes in capital Our articles of association enable us to increase or reduce our share capital. Any such changes are subject to the provisions of the Companies Law and must be approved by a resolution duly passed by our shareholders at a general or special meeting by voting on such change. Establishment We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel on December 31, 1989. Our predecessor commenced operations in 1987. We are registered with the Israeli Registrar of Companies in Jerusalem. Our registration number is 51-143950-7. Our purpose as set forth in Article 5 of our articles of association is to engage in any lawful business. Transfer agent and registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our ordinary shares is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Its address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, and its telephone number is (800) 937-5449. Listing Our ordinary shares have been approved for quotation on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSTE.” c. Material Contracts We entered into an underwriting agreement between us and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, on March 21, 2012, with respect to the ordinary shares sold in our IPO in the United States. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect of such liabilities.

Exchange Controls In 1998, Israeli currency control regulations were liberalized significantly, so that Israeli residents generally may freely deal in foreign currency and foreign assets, and non-residents may freely deal in Israeli currency and Israeli assets. There are currently no Israeli currency control restrictions on remittances of dividends on the ordinary shares or the proceeds from the sale of the shares provided that all taxes were paid or withheld; however, legislation remains in effect pursuant to which currency controls can be imposed by administrative action at any time. Non-residents of Israel may freely hold and trade our securities. Neither our memorandum of association nor our articles of association nor the laws of the State of Israel restrict in any way the ownership or voting of ordinary shares by non-residents, except that such restrictions may exist with respect to citizens of countries which are in a state of war with Israel. Israeli residents are allowed to purchase our ordinary shares. e. Taxation The following description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. You should consult your own tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences that may arise under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction. Israeli tax considerations and government programs The following is a brief summary of the material Israeli tax laws applicable to us, and certain Israeli Government programs benefiting us. This section also contains a discussion of material Israeli tax consequences concerning the ownership of and disposition of our ordinary shares. This summary does not discuss all aspects of Israeli tax law that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances or to some types of investors, such as traders in securities, who are subject to special treatment under Israeli law. Because some parts of this discussion are based on new tax legislation that has not yet been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, we cannot assure you that the Israeli governmental and tax authorities or the Israeli courts will accept the views expressed below. The discussion below is subject to amendment under Israeli law or changes to the applicable judicial or administrative interpretations of Israeli law, which could affect the tax consequences described below. The discussion below does not cover all possible tax considerations. Potential investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the Israeli or other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares, including in particular, the effect of any foreign, state or local taxes. General corporate tax structure in Israel Israeli companies were generally subject to corporate tax at the rate of 25% in 2010 and 24% in 2011. Prior to the enactment of the Law for Changing the Tax Burden in Israel (the “Tax Change Law”), Israeli corporate tax rates were scheduled to be reduced to 23% in 2012 and ultimately to 18% by 2016. This scheduled gradual reduction in corporate tax rates was repealed. Instead, the Tax Change Law provides that the corporate tax rate was increased to 25% in 2012 and 2013, further increased to 26.5% in 2014, and thereafter. However, the effective corporate tax rate payable by a company that derives income from an Approved Enterprise, a Beneficiary Enterprise or a Preferred Enterprise (as discussed below) may be considerably less. Capital gains generated by an Israeli company are subject to tax at the prevailing corporate tax rate. 103 Foreign Exchange Regulations: Commencing in taxable year 2014, we had elected and were premitted by the ITA to measure our taxable income and file our tax return under the Israeli Income Foreign Tax Regulations. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, an Israeli company must calculate its tax liability in U.S. dollars according to certain orders. The tax liability, as calculated in U.S. dollars, is translated into NIS based on the exchange rate as of December 31 of each year. Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969 The Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969, generally referred to as the “Encouragement of Industry Law,” provides several tax benefits for “Industrial Companies.” Pursuant to the Encouragement of Industry Law, a company qualifies as an Industrial Company if it is a resident of Israel and at least 90% of its gross income in any tax year (exclusive of income from certain defense loans) is generated from an “Industrial Enterprise” that it owns. An Industrial Enterprise is defined as an enterprise whose principal activity, in a given tax year, is industrial manufacturing. An Industrial Company is entitled to certain tax benefits, including: (i) a deduction of the cost of purchases of patents, know-how and certain other intangible property rights (other than goodwill) used for the development or promotion of the Industrial Enterprise over a period of eight years, beginning from the year in which such rights were first used, (ii) the right to elect to file consolidated tax returns, under certain conditions, with additional Israeli Industrial Companies controlled by it, and (iii) the right to deduct expenses related to public offerings in equal amounts over a period of three years beginning from the year of the offering. Eligibility for benefits under the Encouragement of Industry Law is not contingent upon the approval of any governmental authority. There is no assurance that we qualify or will continue to qualify as an Industrial Company or that the benefits described above will be available in the future. Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 The Israeli Investment Law provides different benefits to “Approved Enterprise”, “Beneficiary Enterprise” and “Preferred Enterprise”. The Investment Law provides that a capital investment in eligible facilities may, upon application to the Investment Center of the Ministry of Economy of the State of Israel (the “Investment Center”), be designated as an “Approved Enterprise.” Each certificate of approval for an Approved Enterprise relates to a specific investment program delineated both by its financial scope, including its sources of capital, and by its physical characteristics, e.g., the equipment to be purchased and utilized pursuant to the program. The tax benefits generated from any such certificate of approval relate only to taxable income attributable to the specific Approved Enterprise. A company owning an Approved Enterprise is eligible for a combination of grants and tax benefits (the “Grant Track”). The tax benefits under the Grant Track include accelerated depreciation and amortization for tax purposes as well as the taxation of income generated from an Approved Enterprise at reduced tax rates. Regarding Grant Tracks approved prior to Amendment No. 68, the maximum corporate tax rate is 25%, for a certain period of time. The benefit period is ordinarily seven years commencing with the year in which the Approved Enterprise first generates taxable income. The benefit period is limited to 12 years from the earlier of the operational year as determined by the Investment Center or 14 years from the date of approval of the Approved Enterprise. A company owning an Approved Enterprise under Amendment No. 68, is eligible, under specific provisions of the Encouragement Law, for the reduced tax rate of Preferred Enterprise status as discussed below. 104 A company owning an Approved Enterprise that was approved on or after April 1, 1986 through December 31, 2004 had the option to elect to forego its entitlement to grants and tax benefits under the Grant Track and apply for an alternative package of tax benefits for a benefit period of between seven and ten years (the “Alternative Track”). The benefit period is limited to the earlier of 12 years from the operational year or 14 years from the date of approval. These benefits provide that undistributed income from the Approved Enterprise is generally fully exempt from corporate tax for a defined period ranging generally between two and ten years from the first year of taxable income, depending principally upon the location of the enterprise within Israel and the type of the Approved Enterprise. Upon expiration of such tax exempt benefit period, the Approved Enterprise is subject to tax at the rate of 25% (or a lower rate in the case of a Foreign Investment Company (“FIC”)), for the remainder of the applicable benefit period. However, a company that pays a dividend out of income generated from the Approved Enterprise(s) during the tax exemption period will be subject to the deferred corporate tax with respect to the amount distributed (grossed up with the effective corporate tax rate which would have applied if the company had not enjoyed the exemption) at the reduced tax rate ranging between 10% and 25% depending on the percentage of foreign ownership in the company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an amendment to the Investment Law, effective as of April 1, 2005, changed certain criteria of the Investment Law (“Amendment No. 60”). An eligible program under Amendment No. 60 qualifies for benefits as a “Beneficiary Enterprise” (rather than as an Approved Enterprise which status is still applicable for investment programs approved prior to December 31, 2004 and/or investment programs under the Grant Track). According to Amendment No. 60, only investment programs eligible for grants under the Grant Track require the prior approval of the Investment Center. Amendment No. 60 also specifies the criteria necessary for investments to qualify as a Beneficiary Enterprise. In order to receive tax benefits as a Beneficiary Enterprise, Amendment No. 60 states that, among other requirements, a company must meet certain conditions including the making of a minimum investment in the Beneficiary Enterprise within a specified amount of time. The tax benefits granted to a Beneficiary Enterprise are determined, depending on the location of the Beneficiary Enterprise within Israel, among other factors, according to one of the following tracks: 1. Similar to the Alternative Track, an exemption from corporate tax may be available on undistributed income for a period of two to ten years, depending on the location of the Beneficiary Enterprise within Israel, as well as a reduced corporate tax rate of 10% to 25% for the remainder of the benefit period, depending on the level of foreign investment in each year (the “Tax Benefits Track”). Benefits are generally granted for a term of seven to ten years, depending on the location of the enterprise within Israel and the level of foreign investment in the company. However, a company that pays a dividend out of income generated from the Beneficiary Enterprise during the tax exemption period is subject to the deferred corporate tax with respect to the amount distributed (grossed up with the effective corporate tax rate which would have applied if the company had not enjoyed the exemption) at a reduced tax rate between 10% and 25%, depending on the level of foreign investment. The company is required to withhold tax on such distribution at a rate of 15% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable double tax treaty); or 2. A special track which enables companies owning facilities in certain locations within Israel to pay corporate tax at the flat rate of 11.5% on the income of the Beneficiary Enterprise (the “Ireland Track”). The benefit period is for ten years. Upon payment of a dividend, the company will not be required to pay an additional corporate tax, but will be subject to a withholding tax on such dividend at a rate of 15% for Israeli residents and at a rate of 4% for foreign residents. Some of our facilities had been granted “Approved Enterprise” status by the Investment Center, which entitled us to investment grants and tax benefits for certain of our investment programs. Until the end of the tax year 2010, we were eligible for tax benefits under three different Approved Enterprise programs. Two of the programs provided us with certain tax benefits for a period of seven consecutive years. The third program provided us with an investment grant of 24% of our approved investments, in addition to certain tax benefits, for a period of seven consecutive years. In addition, some of our facilities had the status of a Beneficiary Enterprise which made us eligible for tax benefits for a period of up to ten years. Our elective year in this program is the year 2008. In December 2010, the Israeli parliament, or the Knesset, approved the Economic Policy Law for the years 2011 and 2012 , which among others things, amended the Investment Law. Amendment No. 68 to the Investment Law, effective as of January 1, 2011, changes the benefit alternatives under the Investment Law. Eligible companies under Amendment No. 68 can receive benefits as a “Preferred Enterprise.” In order to receive benefits as a Preferred Enterprise, Amendment No. 68 states, among other requirements, that a company must meet certain conditions including owning an industrial enterprise that meets the “Competitive Enterprise” conditions as described by the Investment Law. The benefits granted to a Preferred Enterprise are determined depending on the location of the Preferred Enterprise within Israel. Qualified enterprises located in specific locations within Israel are eligible for grants and/or loans simultaneously with tax benefits. Grants and/or loans are approved by the Israeli Investment Center. 105 Amendment No. 68 imposes a reduced flat corporate tax rate which is not program-dependent and applies to the industrial enterprise’s entire preferred income. The reduced flat corporate tax rates for qualified industrial enterprises are as follows: 1. In 2011-2012, the reduced tax rate is 10% or 15% depending on the Preferred Enterprise’s location in Israel. 2. In 2013-2014, the reduced tax rate will be 7% or 12.5% depending on the Preferred Enterprise’s location in Israel. 3. In 2015 and onwards, the reduced tax rate will be 6% or 12% depending on the Preferred Enterprise’s location in Israel. 4. Subsequently, on August 5, 2013, the 2014 and onwards tax bracket was increased by the Knesset to 9% or 16% depending on the Preferred Enterprise’s location in Israel. The tax benefits under Amendment No. 68 also include accelerated depreciation and amortization for tax purposes. A company that pays a dividend out of income generated from the Preferred Enterprise is required to withhold tax on such distribution at a rate of 15% (or a reduced rate under an applicable double tax treaty). Subsequently, such rate was raised to 20% effective 2014 and onwards, based on the August 5, 2013 Knesset decision. Upon a distribution of a dividend to an Israeli company, no withholding tax is remitted. Generally, a company that owns a “Unique Preferred Enterprise” is entitled to a reduced tax rate of 5% or 8%, depending on the Unique Preferred Enterprise location in Israel. The classification as a Unique Preferred Enterprise will be based on a business plan that demonstrates, among other factors, the enterprise’s material contribution to Israel’s economy and promotion of national market targets. In addition, compliance with certain threshold prerequisites is required. We have examined the effect of the implementation of Amendment No. 68 on our financial statements and announced the election of the provisions of Amendment No. 68 on April 11, 2011. Therefore, we are entitled to tax benefits under Amendment No. 68 beginning in year 2011. Once announced, the election of the provisions of Amendment No. 68 cannot be rescinded and all previous Tracks that were effective under the Grant Tracks (Approved Enterprise) and the Tax Benefits Track (Beneficiary Enterprise) expired at the end of 2010. Since we announced the election prior to July 30, 2015, we will be entitled to distribute exempt income generated by the Approved/Beneficiary Enterprise to our Israeli corporate shareholders tax free. Under Amendment No. 68 and from January, 1, 2011, our facilities have “Preferred Enterprise” status, which entitles us to tax benefits at a flat reduced corporate tax rate that will apply to the industrial enterprise’s entire preferred. Those tax rates since 2014 are 16% for the income portion related to the Kibbutz Sdot-Yam facility and 9% for the income portion related to the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility. In addition, the Bar-Lev manufacturing facility is eligible to receive a grant of up to 20% on capital investments, subject to the approval of the Investment Center. In November 2012, Amendment No. 69 to the Investment Law (the “Trapped Earnings Law”) was passed. This amendment provides temporary, partial, relief from taxation on a distribution of dividends from exempt income for companies that elect the “relief option” through November 2013. The Trapped Earnings Law allows a company to qualify a portion of its exempt income (“Elected Earnings”) for a reduced tax rate ranging between 6% to 17.5% (the “relief option”). While the reduced tax is payable within 30 days of election, an electing company is not required to actually distribute the Elected Earnings within a certain period of time. The applicable rate is based on a linear formula involving the portion of Elected Earnings to exempt income and the applicable tax rate prescribed according to the Investment Law. A company electing to qualify its exempt income must undertake to make designated investments in productive fixed assets, research and development in Israel, or wages of new employees during a period of five years starting the year which the company applied the Trapped Earnings Law (“Designated Investment”). The Designated Investment amount is defined by a formula that considers the portion of Elected Earnings to the exempt income and the applicable tax rate prescribed according to the Investment Law. In addition to the reduced tax rate, a distribution of Elected Earnings would be subject to a 15% withholding tax and from 2014 and onwards 20%. We have examined the effect of the Trapped Earnings Law on our financial statements and decided to not elect the “relief option” to not apply the Trapped Earnings Law. There can be no assurance that we will comply with the conditions required to remain eligible for benefits under the Investment Law in the future or that we will be entitled to any additional benefits thereunder. The benefits available to Beneficiary, Approved and Preferred Enterprises are conditioned upon terms stipulated in the Investment Law and regulations, in the case of the “Grants Track” (under the Investment Law before and after Amendment No. 68), also to the criteria set forth in the applicable certificate of approval. If we do not fulfill these conditions in whole or in part, the benefits can be reduced or canceled and we may be required to refund the amount of the benefits, linked to the Israeli consumer price index, with interest. 106 The Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development Law, 5744-1984 The Israeli law under which the OCS of the Ministry of Economy of the State of Israel grants are made, limits our ability to manufacture products, or transfer technologies developed using these grants outside of Israel. If we were to seek approval to manufacture products, to consummate a merger or acquisition transaction with a non-Israeli third party or to transfer technologies developed using these grants outside of Israel, we could be subject to additional royalty requirements or be required to pay certain redemption fees. If we were to violate these restrictions, we could be required to refund any grants previously received, together with interest and penalties, and may be subject to criminal charges. We believe that our planned construction of a new production facility in the United States will not subject us to any royalty payment obligations or require us to refund any grants because our OCS grants financed our development of a product that has not been commercialized and will not be manufactured at the U.S. production facility. In addition, based on OCS statements, we believe that our OCS funding is exempted from royalty payment obligations. During2013, and 2012, we recognized OCS grants of $0.01 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. Our relevant program with the OCS ended in 2013. Taxation of our shareholders Capital gains Capital gains tax is imposed on the disposal of capital assets by an Israeli resident and on the disposal of such assets by a non-Israeli resident if those assets are either (i) located in Israel; (ii) shares or rights to shares in an Israeli resident company, or (iii) represent, directly or indirectly, rights to assets located in Israel. The Israeli Income Tax Ordinance distinguishes between “Real Capital Gain” and “Inflationary Surplus.” The Real Capital Gain on the disposition of a capital asset is the amount of total capital gain in excess of Inflationary Surplus. Inflationary Surplus is computed, generally, on the basis of the increase in the Israeli Consumer Price Index between the date of purchase and the date of disposal of the capital asset. Real Capital Gain generated by a company is generally subject to tax at the corporate tax rate (24% in 2011, 25% in 2012 and 2013 and 26.5% in 2014 thereafter). As of January 1, 2012, the Real Capital Gain accrued by individuals on the sale of our securities is taxed at the rate of 25%. However, if the individual shareholder is a “Controlling Shareholder” (i.e., a person who holds, directly or indirectly, alone or together with another, 10% or more of one of the Israeli resident company’s “means of control” (including, among other rights, the right to company profits, voting rights, the right to the company’s liquidation proceeds and the right to appoint a company director) at the time of sale or at any time during the preceding 12 month period, such gain will be taxed at the rate of 30%. Individual and corporate shareholders dealing in securities in Israel are taxed at the tax rates applicable to business income (a tax rate of 24% for a corporation in 2011, 25% in 2012 and 2013 and 26.5% in 2014 and thereafter) and a marginal tax rate of up to 45% for an individual in 2011, 48% in 2012 and 50% in 2013 and thereafter. In 2014, an additional tax liability of 2% was added to the applicable tax rate on the annual taxable income of individuals (whether any such individual is an Israeli resident or non-Israeli resident) exceeding NIS 811,560 ($208,681). Notwithstanding the foregoing, capital gains generated from the sale of securities by a non-Israeli shareholder may be exempt under the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance from Israeli taxes provided that all the following conditions are met: (i) the securities were purchased upon or after the registration of the securities on a stock exchange (this requirement generally does not apply to shares purchased on or after January 1, 2009), (ii) the seller of the securities does not have a permanent establishment in Israel to which the generated capital gain is attributed and (iii) if the seller is a corporation, less than 25% of its means of control are held, directly and indirectly, by Israeli resident shareholders. In addition, the sale of the securities may be exempt from Israeli capital gain tax under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty. For example, the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Israel-U.S.A. Double Tax Treaty”) exempts U.S. residents from Israeli capital gains tax in connection with such sale, provided that (i) the U.S. resident owned, directly or indirectly, less than 10% of the Israeli resident company’s voting power at any time within the 12-month period preceding such sale; (ii) the seller, if an individual, has been present in Israel for less than 183 days (in the aggregate) during the taxable year; and (iii) the capital gain from the sale was not generated through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident in Israel. The purchaser of the securities, the stockbrokers who effected the transaction or the financial institution holding the traded securities through which payment to the seller is made are obligated, subject to the above-referenced exemptions, to withhold tax on the Real Capital Gains resulting from a sale of securities at the rate of 25% for a corporation and/or an individual (the withholding tax rate applicable to an individual was 20% in 2011). A detailed return, including a computation of the tax due, must be filed and an advance payment must be paid on January 31 and June 30 of each tax year for sales of securities traded on a stock exchange made within the previous six months. However, if all tax due was withheld at the source according to applicable provisions of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the return does not need to be filed and an advance payment does not need to be made. Capital gains are also reportable on an annual income tax return. 107 Dividends A distribution of a dividend from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise/Beneficiary Enterprise (either to an individual or a corporation) will be subject to tax in Israel at the rate of 15% (4% for a foreign investor under the Ireland Track), subject to a reduced rate under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty. A distribution of a dividend from income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise to an Israeli corporation will be tax exempt in Israel. Only a distribution of a dividend to an individual or a foreign company will be subject to withholding tax in Israel at a rate of 20% from 2014 and onward or in accordance with the relevant tax treaty. In addition, subject to certain conditions, Preferred Enterprises can distribute dividends derived from accumulated historic profits attributed to Approved/Beneficiary Enterprises free of tax to an Israeli corporation shareholder. A distribution of a dividend from income that is not attributed to an Approved Enterprise/Beneficiary Enterprise/Preferred Enterprise to an Israeli resident individual will generally be subject to income tax at a rate of 25%. If the recipient of the dividend is an Israeli resident company, such dividend will be exempt from income tax provided the income from which such dividend is distributed was generated or accrued in Israel. As of January 1, 2012, the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance provides that a non-Israeli resident (either an individual or a corporation) is generally subject to an Israeli income tax on the receipt of dividends at the rate of 25%. Such rates may be reduced by the application of the provisions of applicable double tax treaties. Thus, under the Israel-U.S.A. Double Tax Treaty the following rates will apply to dividends distributed by an Israeli resident company to a U.S. resident: (i) if (A) the U.S. resident is a corporation which held during the portion of the taxable year preceding the date of payment of the dividend and during the whole of its prior taxable year (if any), at least 10% of the outstanding shares of the voting stock of the Israeli resident paying company and (B) not more than 25% of the gross income of the Israeli resident paying company for such prior taxable year (if any) consists of certain type of interest or dividends then the tax rate is 12.5%, (ii) if both the conditions mentioned in section (i) above are met and the dividend is paid from the income of an Israeli resident company which was entitled to a reduced tax rate applicable to an Approved Enterprise/Beneficiary Enterprise/Preferred Enterprise then the tax rate is 15%, and (iii) in all other cases, the tax rate is 25%. The aforementioned rates will not apply if the dividend income was generated through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident in Israel. Our company is obligated to withhold tax, upon the distribution of a dividend attributed to an Approved Enterprise’s/Beneficiary Enterprise’s/Preferred Enterprise’s income from the amount distributed at the following rates: (i) Israeli resident corporations – 0%, (ii) Israeli resident individuals – 15%/20% (the 20% tax rate shall apply if the dividend distributed from 2014 and onwards from income attributed to the Preferred Enterprise) and (iii) non-Israeli residents – 15%/20% (the 20% tax rate shall apply if the dividend distributed from 2014 and onwards from income attributed to the Preferred Enterprise), subject to a reduced tax rate under the provisions of an applicable double tax treaty. If the dividend is distributed from income not attributed to the Approved Enterprise/Beneficiary Enterprise/Preferred Enterprise, the following withholding tax rates will apply: (a) for securities registered and held by a clearing corporation: (i) Israeli resident corporations – 0%, (ii) Israeli resident individuals – 25% and (iii) non-Israeli residents – 25%, subject to a reduced tax rate under the provisions of an applicable double tax treaty; (b) in all other cases: (i) Israeli resident corporations – 0%, (ii) Israeli resident individuals – 25% at the time of the distribution or at any time during the preceding 12 month period)), and (iii) non-Israeli residents – 25% as referred to above with respect to Israeli resident individuals, subject to a reduced tax rate under the provisions of an applicable double tax treaty. Estate and gift tax Israeli law presently does not impose estate or gift taxes. United States federal income taxation The following is a description of the material United States federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder (as defined below) of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. This description addresses only the United States federal income tax consequences to holders that hold such ordinary shares as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes. This description does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation: · banks, financial institutions or insurance companies; 108 · real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies or grantor trusts; · dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies; · tax-exempt entities; · certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; · persons that received our shares as compensation for the performance of services; · persons that will hold our shares as part of a “hedging,” “integrated” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” for United States federal income tax purposes; · partnerships (including entities classified as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes) or other pass-through entities, or holders that will hold our shares through such an entity; · S-corporations; · holders that acquire ordinary shares as a result of holding or owning our preferred shares; · U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. Dollar; or · holders that own directly, indirectly or through attribution 10.0% or more of the voting power or value of our shares. Moreover, this description does not address the United States federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, or any state, local or foreign tax consequences, of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. This description is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), existing, proposed and temporary United States Treasury Regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, in each case as in effect and available on the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below. There can be no assurances that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares or that such a position could not be sustained. For purposes of this description, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that, for United States federal income tax purposes, is: · a citizen or resident of the United States; · a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, including the District of Columbia; · an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or · a trust if such trust has validly elected to be treated as a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes or if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and (2) one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of such trust. If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds our ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its tax advisor as to its tax consequences. You should consult your tax advisor with respect to the United States federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our ordinary shares. 109 Distributions Subject to the discussion below under “Passive foreign investment company considerations,” if you are a U.S. Holder, the gross amount of any distribution made to you with respect to our ordinary shares before reduction for any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom, other than pro rata distributions of our ordinary shares to all our shareholders, generally will be includible in your income as dividend income to the extent such distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Subject to the discussion below under “Passive foreign investment company considerations,” non-corporate U.S. Holders may qualify for the lower rates of taxation with respect to dividends on ordinary shares applicable to long-term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale of capital assets held for more than one year) provided that certain conditions are met, including certain holding period requirements and the absence of certain risk reduction transactions. However, such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. Holders. Subject to the discussion below under “Passive foreign investment company considerations,” to the extent that the amount of any distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under United States federal income tax principles, it will be treated first as a tax-free return of your adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares and thereafter as capital gain. We do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits under United States federal income tax principles and, therefore, U.S. Holders should expect that the entire amount of any distribution generally will be reported as dividend income. Dividends paid to U.S. Holders with respect to our ordinary shares will be treated as foreign source income, which may be relevant in calculating your foreign tax credit limitation. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, Israeli tax withheld on dividends may be deducted from your taxable income or credited against your United States federal income tax liability. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends that we distribute generally should constitute “passive category income,” or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, “general category income.” A foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed on distributions may be denied if you do not satisfy certain minimum holding period requirements. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are complex, and you should consult your tax advisor to determine whether and to what extent you will be entitled to this credit. Future distributions with respect to our ordinary shares may be paid in U.S. dollars or NIS. If a distribution is denominated in NIS, the amount of such distribution will equal the U.S. dollar value of the NIS received, calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date that distribution is received, whether or not the U.S. Holder in fact converts any NIS received into U.S. dollars at that time. If the distribution is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the distribution. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the distribution is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt. Any gains or losses resulting from the conversion of NIS into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss, as the case may be, of the U.S. Holder and will be U.S.-source. Sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares Subject to the discussion below under “Passive foreign investment company considerations,” U.S. Holders generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our ordinary shares equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale, exchange or other disposition and such holder’s adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares, and such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. The adjusted tax basis in an ordinary share generally will be equal to the cost of such ordinary share. If you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder, capital gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares is generally eligible for a preferential rate of taxation applicable to capital gains, if your holding period for such ordinary shares exceeds one year (i.e., such gain is long-term capital gain). The deductibility of capital losses for United States federal income tax purposes is subject to limitations under the Code. Any such gain or loss that a U.S. Holder recognizes generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Passive foreign investment company considerations If we were to be classified as a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, in any taxable year, a U.S. Holder would be subject to special rules generally intended to reduce or eliminate any benefits from the deferral of United States federal income tax that a U.S. Holder could derive from investing in a non-U.S. company that does not distribute all of its earnings on a current basis. A non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either: · at least 75% of its gross income is “passive income”; or · at least 50% of the average value of its gross assets is attributable to assets that produce “passive income” or are held for the production of passive income. 110 Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, gains from commodities and securities transactions, the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income, and includes amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of funds raised in offerings of our ordinary shares. If a non-U.S. corporation owns at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, the non-U.S. corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation’s income. If we are classified as a PFIC in any year with respect to which a U.S. Holder owns our ordinary shares, we will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder in all succeeding years during which the U.S. Holder owns our ordinary shares, regardless of whether we continue to meet the tests described above. Based on the composition of our income, the composition and estimated fair market value of our assets and the nature of our business, we do not believe we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2014 and do not expect that we will be classified as a PFIC for the taxable year ending December 31, 2015. However, because PFIC status is based on our income, assets and activities for the entire taxable year, it is not possible to determine whether we will be characterized as a PFIC for the 2015 taxable year until after the close of the taxable year. Moreover, we must determine our PFIC status annually based on tests which are factual in nature, and our status in future years will depend on our income, assets and activities in those years. Furthermore, because the value of our gross assets is likely to be determined in large part by reference to our market capitalization, a decline in the value of our ordinary shares may result in our becoming a PFIC. There can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. If we were a PFIC then unless you make one of the elections described below, a special tax regime will apply to both (a) any “excess distribution” by us to you (generally, your ratable portion of distributions in any year which are greater than 125% of the average annual distribution received by you in the shorter of the three preceding years or your holding period for our ordinary shares) and (b) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares. Under this regime, any excess distribution and realized gain will be treated as ordinary income and will be subject to tax as if (a) the excess distribution or gain had been realized ratably over your holding period, (b) the amount deemed realized in each year had been subject to tax in each year of that holding period at the highest marginal rate for such year (other than income allocated to the current period or any taxable period before we became a PFIC, which will be subject to tax at the U.S. Holder’s regular ordinary income rate for the current year and will not be subject to the interest charge discussed below), and (c) the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax had been imposed on the taxes deemed to have been payable in those years. In addition, dividend distributions made to you will not qualify for the lower rates of taxation applicable to long-term capital gains discussed above under “Distributions.” Certain elections may be available that would result in an alternative treatment (such as mark-to-market treatment) of our ordinary shares. We do not intend to provide the information necessary for U.S. Holders to make qualified electing fund elections if we are classified as a PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine whether any of these elections would be available and if so, what the consequences of the alternative treatments would be in their particular circumstances. If we are determined to be a PFIC, the general tax treatment for U.S. Holders described in this paragraph would apply to indirect distributions and gains deemed to be realized by U.S. Holders in respect of any of our subsidiaries that also may be determined to be PFICs. If a U.S. Holder owns ordinary shares during any year in which we are classified as a PFIC and the U.S. Holder recognizes gain on a disposition of our ordinary shares or receives distributions with respect to our ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder generally will be required to file an IRS Form 8621 with respect to the company, generally with the U.S. Holder’s federal income tax return for that year. If our company were a PFIC for a given taxable year, then you should consult your tax advisor concerning your annual filing requirements. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding whether we are a PFIC and the potential application of the PFIC rules. Backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements United States backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments to certain holders of stock. Information reporting generally will apply to payments of dividends on, and to proceeds from the sale or redemption of, our ordinary shares made within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, to a holder of our ordinary shares, other than an exempt recipient (including a payee that is not a United States person that provides an appropriate certification and certain other persons). A payor will be required to withhold backup withholding tax from any payments of dividends on, or the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, ordinary shares within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, to a holder, other than an exempt recipient, if such holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or establish an exemption from, such backup withholding tax requirements. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the beneficial owner’s United States federal income tax liability, if any, and any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 111 3.8% Medicare Tax on “Net Investment Income” Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates or trusts are required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares of common stock. Foreign asset reporting Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals are required to report information relating to an interest in our ordinary shares, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for shares held in accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions). U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their information reporting obligations, if any, with respect to their ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. You should consult your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of your particular situation. f. Dividends and Paying Agents Not applicable. g. Statements by Experts Not applicable. h. Documents on Display We are currently subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers and fulfill the obligations of these requirements by filing reports with the SEC. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act relating to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we intend to file with the SEC, within 120 days after the end of each subsequent fiscal year, an annual report on Form 20-F containing financial statements which will be examined and reported on, with an opinion expressed, by an independent public accounting firm. We also intend to furnish with the SEC reports on Form 6-K containing unaudited quarterly financial information. You may read and copy any document we file with the SEC without charge at the SEC’s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may also obtain copies of the documents at prescribed rates by writing to the Public Reference Section of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference room. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are also available to the public through this web site at http://www.sec.gov. As permitted under Nasdaq Rule 5250(d)(1)(C), we will post our annual reports filed with the SEC on our website at we will post our annual reports filed with the SEC on our website at http://www.caesarstone.com. The information contained on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. We will also furnish hard copies of such reports to our shareholders free of charge upon written request. i. Subsidiary Information Not applicable. ITEM 11: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Since July 1, 2012, our functional currency has been the U.S. dollar. We conduct business in a large number of countries and, as a result, we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, Australian dollars and Canadian dollars. Sales in Australian dollars accounted for 24.0%, 25.2%, and 30.0% of our revenues in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Sales in Canadian dollars accounted for 12.9%, 13.8%, and 13.6% of our revenues in 2014, 2013,and 2012, respectively. As a result, devaluation of the Australian dollar, and to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profitability significantly. Our expenses are largely denominated in, US dollars, NIS and euros, and a smaller proportion in Australian and Canadian dollars. As a result, a revaluation of the NIS, or to a lesser extent, the euro, relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profitability significantly. 112 The following table presents information about the year over year percentage changes in the average exchange rates of the principal currencies that impact our results of operations: Australian dollar against U.S. dollar Canadian dollar against U.S. dollar NIS against U.S. dollar Euro against U.S. dollar 2012 0.3% (1.1)% (7.2)% (7.6)% 2013 (6.4)% (2.9)% 6.8% 3.4% 2014 (6.7)% (6.7)% 1.1% 0.0% Assuming a 10% decrease in the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and assuming no other changes, our operating income would have decreased by 8.4 million in 2014. An appreciation of NIS relative to the U.S. dollar, would increase our revenues generated in Israel. However, our operating costs denominated in U.S. dollars would increase to a greater extent, resulting in lower operating income. As a result, assuming a 10% increase in NIS relative to the U.S. dollar and assuming no other changes, our operating income, as reported in U.S. dollars, would decrease by $3.9 million in 2014. Assuming a 10% decrease in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and assuming no other changes, our operating income would have decreased by $4.0 million in 2014. Assuming a 10% increase in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and assuming no other changes, our operating income would have decreased by $0.9 in 2014. Our exposure related to exchange rate changes on our net asset position denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar varies with changes in our net asset position. Net asset position refers to financial assets, such as trade receivables and cash, less financial liabilities, such as loans and accounts payable. The impact of any such transaction gains or losses is reflected in finance expenses, net. Our exposure was reduced when we obtained new loans in 2009 in Australian, U.S. and Canadian dollars, however, as the loan balances have been reduced, and in 2013 completely repaid, the exposure has increased. Our most significant exposure as of December 31, 2014, relates to a potential change in the exchange rate of the NIS and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Assuming a 10% increase in the NIS and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar, and assuming no other changes, our finance expenses would have increased by $1.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in 2014 due to our current net liability position denominated in both currencies. A change of 10% decrease in Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would have an impact of $0.5 million based on our December 31, 2014 net asset position. We use forward contracts to manage currency risk with respect to those currencies in which we generate revenues or incur expenses. Beginning in July 2012, when we changed our functional currency to the U.S. dollar, we have used Australian/U.S. dollar, Euro/U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar forward contracts along with U.S. dollar/NIS and Euro/U.S. dollar options. Prior to July 2012, we used Australian dollar/NIS, Euro/NIS and Canadian dollar/NIS forward contracts. The derivatives instruments partially offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We may in the future use derivative instruments to a greater extent or engage in other transactions or invest in market risk sensitive instruments if we determine that it is necessary to offset these risks. Currency instruments other than our USD/NIS forward contracts are not designated as hedging accounting instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (originally issued as SFAS 133). Therefore, we have been incurring financial loss or income as a result of these derivatives. 113 As of December 31, 2014, we had the following foreign currency hedge portfolio(USD in thousands): USD/NIS USD/CAD EUR/USD AUD/USD TOTAL Buy forward contracts Notional – 9,564 16,126 – 25,689 Fair value – 426 (1,053 ) – (627 ) Average rate – 1.11 1.30 – Sell forward contracts Notional 12,925 – – 21,067 33,992 Fair value (1,447 ) – – 1,803 355 Average rate 3.45 – – 0.88 Buy put options Notional 20,411 – – – 20,411 Fair value 250 – – – 250 Average rate 3.77 – – – Sell call options Notional 19,472 – – – 19,472 Fair value (400 ) – – – (400 ) Average rate 3.95 – – – Total notional value 52,808 9,564 16,126 21,067 99,565 Total fair value $ (1,596 ) $ 426 $ (1,053 ) $ 1,803 $ (421 ) For the year ended December 31, 2014, net embedded losses on our foreign currency open derivative transactions were $0.4. For the year ended December 31, 2013, net embedded gains on our foreign currency derivatives transactions totaled $1.6 million for open derivative transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2012, net embedded loss on our foreign currency derivatives transactions totaled $0.7 million for open derivative transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our finance income generated from derivatives including the impact of the foreign exchange rate revaluation were $0.6 For the year ended December 31, 2013, our finance income generated from derivatives and foreign exchange rate transactions were $0.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2012, our finance expenses generated from derivatives and foreign exchange rate transactions were $1.3 million. Interest rates We had cash and short-term bank deposits totaling $54.3 million at December 31, 2014. Our cash, cash equivalents and short term bank deposits are held for working capital and other purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of the investments in cash equivalents and our relatively low debt balances, we do not believe that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and, therefore, we believe that a sensitivity analysis would not be material to investors. However, declines in interest rates will reduce future investment income. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our labor may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit margins and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase in line with increases in costs. ITEM 12: Description of Securities Other Than Equity Securities Not applicable. PART II ITEM 13: Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies None. 114 ITEM 14: Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds Initial Public Offering The effective date of the registration statement (file no. 333-179556) for our IPO of ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.04, was March 21, 2012. The offering commenced on March 6, 2012 and was closed on March 27, 2012. We registered 6,660,000 ordinary shares in the offering and granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to 999,000 additional shares from the selling shareholders to cover over-allotments, if any. The over-allotment was exercised by the underwriters on April 4, 2012. As a result, we issued a total of 7,659,000 ordinary shares with aggregate proceeds of $84.2 million (including the over-allotment option) at a price per share of $11.00. Under the terms of the offering, we incurred aggregate underwriting discounts of $5.5 million (including the over-allotment option), resulting in net proceeds of $78.8 million. We also incurred expenses of $3.4 million in connection with the offering. From the effective date of the registration statement and until December 31, 2012, we used $27.2 million of the net proceeds to pay a special dividend to our existing shareholders immediately following the closing of the IPO. In addition, in December 2013, we paid a $20.1 million dividend to our shareholders of record as of November 27, 2013. Further, in December 2014, we paid a special dividend of $20.0 million to our shareholders of record as of November 26, 2014. See “ITEM 8.A: Financial Information—Consoldiated Statements and Other Financial Information—Dividends.” We used $6.5 million of the net proceeds to pay the balance of the acquisition price for the remaining 75% equity interest in our U.S. distributor, Caesarstone USA, in which we acquired a 25% interest in January 2007. We acquired the remaining interest in May 2011 and the balance of the purchase price was payable following the closing of our IPO. We may use a portion of the balance of the net proceeds to expand our production capacity during the next one to two years. See “
