D. Risk Factors Birch is an Early Production Stage Company Birch opened the Muskeg Valley Quarry, the initial starter quarry situated within the Hammerstone Project, in December 2005, under the regulatory approvals and operating permits received in August 2005. The MVQ is fully operational, providing and selling a range of limestone aggregate products. First commercial sales occurred in the second quarter of 2006. In May 2006, Birch filed an application with the provincial regulatory authorities for the remainder of the Hammerstone Project, to integrate the existing MVQ with an expanded quarry and aggregate plant, as well as a limestone processing complex to produce limestone-based reagent products. There are risks that the MVQ's ongoing operations may experience slowdowns and production interruptions and that operating costs may be higher than estimated. Similarly, there are risks that the Hammerstone Project may be delayed or that the limestone processing complex may not commence operations. These risks are due to many factors, including, without limitation: • breakdown or failure of equipment or processes; • production performance falling below expected levels of output or efficiency; • design errors; • contractor or operator errors; • non-performance by third-party contractors; • labour disputes, disruptions or declines in productivity; • increases in materials, equipment or labour costs; • inability to attract sufficient numbers of qualified workers; • delays in obtaining, or conditions imposed by, regulatory approvals; • changes in the scope of the development or operations; • violation of permit requirements; • disruption of energy supply; and • catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, storms or explosions. The current operation and construction schedules may not proceed as planned, there may be delays and the development of the Hammerstone Project may not be completed on budget. Any such delays will likely increase the costs and may require additional financing, which financing may not be available. Actual costs to construct and develop the Hammerstone Project will vary from estimates and such variances may be significant. Given the stage of development of the Hammerstone Project, various changes may be made prior to completing construction. Based upon current scheduling, the Hammerstone Project is not expected to start commercial quicklime operations until 2009. The information contained herein, including, without limitation, reserve and economic evaluations, is conditional upon receipt of all regulatory approvals and no material changes being made to the planned MVQ operations and the Hammerstone Project. 9 Mineral Reserve Quantities and Quality are Based on Estimates There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of mineral reserves, including many factors beyond Birch's control, and no assurance can be given that the indicated level of reserves or recovery thereof will be realized. In general, estimates of economically recoverable limestone reserves and the future net cash flow there from are based upon a number of factors and assumptions made as of the date on which the reserve estimates were determined, such as estimates of future demand for limestone products, geological and engineering estimates which have inherent uncertainties, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and estimates of future commodity prices and operating costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. All such estimates are, to some degree, uncertain and classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of uncertainty involved. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable limesto ne, the classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenue expected there from, prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Estimates with respect to mineral reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves and/or estimates of future sales, rather than upon actual production history. Estimates based on these methods generally are less reliable than those based on actual production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations, which may be material, in the estimated reserves. Mineral reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production experience. Mineral reserves have been determined based upon projected demand and estimated aggregate and quicklime prices and operating costs. Market price fluctuations of aggregate, quicklime, cement and other product prices may render uneconomic the recovery of certain grades of limestone. Moreover, short-term factors relating to oil sands development and world oil prices may impair profitability in any particular period. No assurance can be provided as to the quantity or quality of the limestone to be produced from the quarry. Birch Has a Lack of Cash Flows and Financing May Not be Available to the Company Birch is a developing company and does not yet have sufficient revenues to meet its yearly operating and capital requirements. The Company has historically raised funds necessary to conduct its business primarily through issuance of equity or debt. There is no guarantee the Company will be able to continue to raise funds through additional equity issuances, project debt financing, joint ventures and/or partnering arrangements. The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception in 1995. Losses are from costs incurred in operating and developing the Industrial Minerals Division, mineral exploration and mineral technology research. Additional operating losses may occur in the future as a result of the continued operation of the MVQ and development of the Hammerstone Project. However, the MVQ is expected to start generating increased revenues from aggregate sales in 2007. Competitive Risk May Reduce the Company's Ability to Operate Birch negotiates sale arrangements with its customers and has proven that its aggregate products are reliable and suitable for use in the oil sands industry. Although the Company believes that competing aggregate resources in the Fort McMurray region are limited in both size and quality and, as a result, high market share assumptions have been made, Birch may have to compete with larger companies that have greater assets and financial and human resources, and which may be able to sustain larger losses than the Company to develop business. Birch, and the economic viability of the MVQ and the Hammerstone Project may be negatively impacted if large new sources of aggregates and/or industrial minerals are located and developed. 10 Although no other quicklime and reagent limestone production operations exist in the region, one or more competitors currently supply lime products to the oil sands industry. Even with a quicklime and reagent limestone plant in the region, Birch expects it will face intense competitive pressures as it begins to bring its reagent limestone and lime products to market. In the face of this competition, Birch may need to lower prices for its products to reach its market share objectives. Alternate Technologies May Reduce the Demand for the Company's Products The use of limestone for aggregates and the use of quicklime and limestone as products for the treatment of air emissions and water treatment could be replaced by alternate technologies if the oil sands industry develops or locates more cost effective and efficient methods. The rate of development of new technologies and the impact of their development on the Company's business cannot be determined. Price Risks May Affect the Marketability of Products Produced and the Company's Financial Results The industrial mineral industry is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of mineral reserves are developed, a profitable market may not exist for the sale of such reserves. Factors beyond the control of the Company may affect the marketability of any product produced. Significant price movements over short periods of time may be affected by numerous factors, including international economic and political trends, expectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations (specifically, the Canadian dollar relative to other currencies), interest rates and global or regional consumption patterns, speculative activities and increased production due to improved mining and production methods. The price of industrial minerals has a significant influence on the market price of the Company's shares and the Company's business activities. The effect of these factors on the price of the Company's products cannot accurately be predicted. Aggregate pricing in the Fort McMurray region is typically done on a spot or job basis and long-term contracts are uncommon. Future prices and forecasting of revenues is difficult and unknown and future prices are outside the control of the Company. If prices decline, the financial results of the Company will be adversely affected. Customer Dependency May Reduce the Flexibility of the Company to Operate Birch is reliant on the oil sands industry in the Fort McMurray area for the majority of its revenue. Costs of transportation of aggregate are high relative to its cost of production and will limit the Company's ability to ship the product over longer distances. Risks affecting oil sands companies, such as fluctuating oil and natural gas prices, fluctuations between the US and Canadian dollar, energy costs, labour shortages and capital cost overruns, could have a negative impact on Birch. There is no guarantee oil sands companies will require the predicted volume of the Company's products. 11 Personnel Risks May Impact the Company's Ability to Carry Out its Operational Plans At December 31, 2006, Birch had 27 full time and two part-time employees. The Company relies on various other part time workers, contractors and consultants to assist in executing operations and providing technical guidance. From time to time, Birch also utilizes the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various specific professional services, particularly in the areas of engineering, environmental assessment, drilling, blasting, crushing, processing, analysis and research. Although Birch believes that its relations with its employees, management, directors, consultants and contractors are satisfactory, there can be no assurance that they will remain with Birch for the immediate or foreseeable future. Birch will be dependent on maintaining its key staff to explore and develop the mineral deposits on the Company's mineral properties. As the Company continues to grow and expand its operations. it will be necessary to rely on workers, contractors and consultants in the local area. In northern Alberta, skilled labour shortages are common. There is uncertainty regarding the ability to retain and attract personnel to the project and should the Company not have adequate personnel, the project may not become operational or may not be economically viable. Additionally, Birch is relying upon the good faith, expertise and judgment of the officers and directors of the Company to make appropriate decisions with respect to investments and operations. Birch Will Require Additional Regulatory Approvals and Operating Permits In the ordinary course of business, mining companies are required to seek regulatory approvals and operating permits from the federal, provincial and local governments for expansion of existing operations and the commencement of new operations. Obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and operating permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous agencies and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings on the part of the Company. The duration and success of regulatory and permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables outside the Company's control. Environmental protection permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, may increase costs and cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority. There can be no assurance that all regulatory approvals and operating permits will be obtained and, if obtained, that the c osts involved will not exceed those previously estimated by the Company. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that the Company could not proceed with the development or operation of the Hammerstone Project. All regulatory approvals and operating permits for the MVQ were received in July 2005. Title Risks May Result in Title Claims or Disputes Birch is satisfied that it has good and proper right, title and interest in and to the mineral properties that are currently under development or in production. Aboriginal peoples have claimed aboriginal title and rights to a substantial portion of western Canada. Certain aboriginal peoples have filed a claim against the Government of Canada, the Province of Alberta, certain governmental entities and the RMWB (which includes the City of Fort McMurray, Alberta) claiming, among other things, aboriginal title to large areas of lands surrounding Fort McMurray, including the lands on which the MVQ and the Hammerstone Project and most of the oil sands operations in Alberta are located. Such claims, if successful, could have a significant adverse effect on the oil sands bitumen producers and on Birch, the MVQ and/or the Hammerstone Project. 12 Regulatory and Environmental Requirements May Impact the Company's Ability to Operate The Company operates in areas that are subject to governmental provisions regulating operations and development of mineral resources. Birch Mountain may be constrained or forbidden to develop its plans or mandated operating guidelines may adversely affect the economic viability of the projects. The Company holds mineral permits and leases issued by the Government of Alberta. Birch is required by regulation to operate under certain environmental guidelines that are mandated by the Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada. Additionally, public expectation of industry's environmental performance remains high. The Company has established environmental policies that it believes will allow it to operate effectively under the environmental guidelines. Birch has and will continue to work with the regulators and local communities to address public environmental concerns. Regulatory agencies may impose operating limitations that could adversely affect Birch's revenues and/or the economic viability of a project. Abandonment and Reclamation Costs and Regulations May Change Birch is responsible for complying with terms and conditions of environmental and regulatory approvals and all laws and regulations regarding the abandonment of the site and reclamation of its lands at the end of its economic life, which abandonment and reclamation costs may be substantial. A breach of such legislation and/or regulations may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including an order for cessation of operations at the site until satisfactory remedies are made. Abandonment and reclamation costs are estimates and since they will be a function of regulatory requirements at the time, costs of goods and services at the time and the value of the salvaged equipment may be more or less than the abandonment and reclamation costs. Birch is required to post bond or a letter of credit with Alberta Environment annually in an amount sufficient to reclaim the lands disturbed, thus managing the long-term reclamation liability. Birch is Subject to Certain Mining Hazards The business of mining is subject to certain types of risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, and industrial accidents. Such occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damages, delays in mining, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Any payments made with regards to such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on Birch's financial position. The Company carries insurance to protect itself against certain risks of mining and processing to the extent that it is economically feasible but which may not be adequate. Independent Reviews Provide No Assurance of Future Results Although third parties have prepared reviews, reports and projections relating to the viability and expected performance of the MVQ and the Hammerstone Project, it cannot be assured that these reports, reviews and projections and the assumptions on which they are based will, over time, prove to be accurate. There is a Possibility of Dilution to Present and Prospective Shareholders Any transaction involving the issuance of additional Birch shares or securities may result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective holders of Common Shares. 13 Shareholders Rights Plan May Discourage Change in Control Transactions Although the Company's shareholders rights plan (Rights Plan) is not intended to prevent a take over of the Company, to secure continuance of current management or the directors in office or to deter fair offers for the common shares of the Company, it may have the result of discouraging certain transactions by making such transactions impractical. See Item 10B - Additional Information - Memorandum and Articles of Association. Enforcement of Civil Liabilities by Present and Prospective Shareholders May be Adversely Affected The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the US may be affected adversely by the fact that the Company is incorporated under the laws of Alberta, Canada, that the independent auditors who have audited the Company's financial statements and some or all of its directors and officers may be residents of Canada or elsewhere, and that all or a substantial portion of the Company's assets and said persons are located outside the US. As a result, it may be difficult for holders of the Common Shares to effect service of process within the US upon people who are not residents of the US or to realize in the US upon judgments of courts of the US predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the US.
