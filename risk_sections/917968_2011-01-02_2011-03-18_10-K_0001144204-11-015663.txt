Item 1A. Risk Factors We may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or our business strategy may not be successful, either of which will impede our growth and operating results. Our business strategy emphasizes expansion through multiple channels of distribution. Our ability to implement this business strategy depends on our ability to: · market our products on a national scale and over the internet; · enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of our coffee; · increase our brand recognition on a national scale; · effectively compete in emerging where consumers purchase their coffee such as single serve; · identify and lease strategic locations suitable for new stores; and · manage growth in administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result from the planned expansion of our retail and non-retail distribution channels. We do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or whether our business strategy will be successful. Our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our business strategy or if we divert resources to a business strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful. Because our business is highly dependent on a single product, specialty coffee, if the demand for specialty coffee decreases, our business could suffer. Sales of specialty coffee constituted approximately 84% of our 2010 and 2009 net revenue and 83% of our 2008 net revenue. Demand for specialty coffee is affected by many factors, including: · Consumer tastes and preferences; · National, regional and local economic conditions; · Demographic trends; and · Perceived or actual health benefits or risks. Because we are highly dependent on consumer demand for specialty coffee, a shift in consumer preferences away from specialty coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified product offerings. If customer demand for specialty coffee decreases, our sales would decrease accordingly. 6 If we fail to continue to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer. We believe that maintaining and developing our brand is critical to our success and that the importance of brand recognition may increase as a result of competitors offering products similar to ours. Because the majority of our retail stores are located on the West Coast, primarily in California, our brand recognition remains largely regional. Our brand building initiative involves increasing the availability of our products in grocery stores, license locations and foodservice locations to increase awareness of our brand and create and maintain brand loyalty. If our brand building initiative is unsuccessful, we may never recover the expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business strategy. Our success in promoting and enhancing the Peet's brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high-quality products and customer service. Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted whole bean coffee and that our retail employees properly prepare our coffee beverages, we have no control over our whole bean coffee products once purchased by customers. Accordingly, customers may prepare coffee from our whole bean coffee inconsistent with our standards, store our whole bean coffee for long periods of time or resell our whole bean coffee without our consent, which in each case, potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared from our products. If customers do not perceive our products and service to be of high-quality, then the value of our brand may be diminished and, consequently, our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected. Coffee costs have increased significantly over the past year and increases in the cost of high-quality Arabica coffee beans could impact the profitability of our business. In second half of 2010 and first quarter of 2011, we have experienced a dramatic rise in the costs of Arabica coffee traded on New York Board of Trade. In mid-March 2011, coffee commodity prices reached a 35-year high at a level approximately 50% higher than they were six months earlier and over 100% higher than they were a year earlier. While we do not purchase coffee on the commodity markets, price movements in the commodity trading of Arabic coffee beans impact the prices we pay. We expect the coffee commodity market to continue to be challenging as the market continues to be influenced by worldwide demand, the weakness of the dollar, speculative trading and weather and as Brazil – the largest coffee producing company – enters a cyclically low production year in its biennial crop cycle. Coffee cost is our second largest cost line item after personnel costs and in 2010 represented approximately 15% of our net revenue. In order to manage coffee costs we purchase and hold large quantities of inventory and use future fixed-price purchase commitments. As of January 2, 2011, between our ending inventory and our fixed-price commitments, we had approximately 21 million pounds of coffee at fixed prices for use in 2011 and 2012. Our requirements for green coffee for 2011 are expected to be approximately 28 to 30 million pounds. Since the coffee we purchase comes from over 20 different countries and creates 28 different types of coffee (including 12 single origin coffees), these coffees are not necessarily interchangeable or substitutable and therefore the covered needs of specific origin coffees varies due to differing growing seasons and origin specific situations. We have historically raised prices in each of our channels to offset the higher costs and we did increase prices in each channel in the fourth quarter of 2010 or the first quarter of 2011. Given the concentration of coffee in our cost structure, if coffee costs do not decline and we are unable to pass along increased coffee costs to our customers through further price increases, our profitability is likely to decrease. We will continue to monitor these markets and take actions we feel are appropriate to minimize the impact on us in the short and long term. Decreases in the availability of high-quality Arabica coffee beans could impact the profitability and growth of our business. In addition to the cost implications of the above-described factors affecting worldwide coffee production and demand, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of high-quality Arabica beans due to those or other factors, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, our revenue may decrease and our ability to expand our business may be negatively impacted. Besides coffee, we face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations, which could impair our profitability. In addition to the increase in coffee costs discussed in the risk factor above, we are exposed to cost fluctuation in other commodities, including, in particular, milk, natural gas and gasoline. In addition, an increase in the cost of fuel could indirectly lead to higher electricity costs, transportation costs and other commodity costs. Much like coffee costs, the costs of these commodities depend on various factors beyond our control, including economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, and global weather patterns. To the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases, our margins and profitability will decrease. 7 The recent recession or a worsening of the United States and global economy could materially adversely affect our business. Our revenues and performance depend significantly on consumer confidence and spending, which have deteriorated due to the recession and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Some of the factors that could influence the levels of consumer confidence and spending include, without limitation, continuing conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, access to credit, labor and healthcare costs, increases in fuel and other energy costs, elevated unemployment levels and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results. Because our business is based primarily in California, a worsening of economic conditions, a decrease in consumer spending or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenue and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy. Our California retail stores generated approximately 55% of our 2010 net revenue and approximately 60% of our 2009 and 2008 net revenue and a substantial portion of the revenue from our other distribution channels is generated in California. We expect that our California operations will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenue. In addition, our California retail stores provide us with means for increasing brand awareness, building customer loyalty and creating a premium specialty coffee brand. As a result, if the current economic downturn and decrease in consumer spending in California continues or worsens, it may not only lead to a substantial decrease in revenue, but may also adversely impact our ability to market our brand, build customer loyalty, or otherwise implement our business strategy. Complaints or claims by current, former or prospective employees or governmental agencies could adversely affect us. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations which govern such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, meal and rest periods, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated, by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters. We have been, and in the future may be, the subject of complaints or litigation from current, former or prospective employees or governmental agencies. In addition, successful complaints against our competitors may spur similar lawsuits against us. For instance, in 2003, two lawsuits (which have since been settled) were filed against us alleging misclassification of employment position and sought damages, restitution, reclassification and attorneys’ fees and costs. In 2008, a lawsuit (which has since been settled) was filed alleging that store managers based in California were not paid overtime wages, were not provided meal or rest periods, were not provided accurate wage statements and were not reimbursed for business expenses. In addition, on February 23, 2010, a complaint was filed by non-exempt employees on their own behalf and on behalf of employees similarly situated alleging claims for unpaid overtime, unpaid meal and rest period premiums, unpaid business expenses, unpaid minimum wages, untimely wages paid at time of termination, untimely payment of wages, failure to pay vacation wages and non-compliant wage statements. These types of claims and litigation involving current, former or prospective employees could divert our management’s time and attention from our business operations and might result in substantial costs of defense, settlement or other disposition, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in one or more fiscal periods. Potential claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition to employment-related claims, Peet’s may be subject to various other claims and litigation. For example, in August 2010, a public interest group sued a number of companies, including us, that sell “ready to drink” coffee in California for allegedly failing to issue clear and reasonable warnings with regard to potential exposures to acrylamide in accordance with California Health and Safety Code section 25249.6 (“Proposition 65”), and in 2007 Peet’s was involved as defendants in lawsuits relating to Peet’s stock option granting practices. Although option-related actions have been dismissed, Peet’s remains subject to the ongoing Proposition 65 litigation and could in the future become subject to other claims and litigation, which could involve, for example, securities law claims, commercial disputes, public health matters and disputes relating to intellectual property. Lawsuits could divert management’s time and attention from day-to-day operations, often result in significant legal expenses, and can result in outcomes that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and its stock price. Labor conditions in the grocery business could negatively impact our grocery business. There have been grocery strikes in the past that have negatively impacted our grocery business and it is possible that future grocery strikes in places where we have large distribution may adversely impact our grocery business. 8 Government mandatory healthcare requirements could adversely affect our profits. The Company offers healthcare benefits to all employees who work at least 21 hours a week and meet service eligibility requirements. In the past, some states, including California, have proposed legislation mandating that employers pay healthcare premiums into a state run fund for all employees immediately upon hiring or pay a penalty for failing to do so. If legislation similar to this was to be enacted in California, or in the other states in which we do business, it could have an adverse affect on the Company’s results of operations. In addition, comprehensive health care legislation (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010) was passed and signed into law in March, 2010. Due to the breadth and complexity of this legislation, the phased-in nature of the implementation, and the lack of implementing regulations, it is difficult to predict the financial and operational impacts this legislation will have on us. Our expenses may significantly increase over the long-term as a result of this legislation. Because we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis, any disruption in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely affect our business. We rely on a number of common carriers to deliver coffee to our customers and retail stores. We consider roasted coffee a perishable product and we rely on these common carriers to deliver fresh roasted coffee on a daily basis. We have no control over these common carriers and the services provided by them may be interrupted as a result of labor shortages, contract disputes or other factors. If we experience an interruption in these services, we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner. A delay in shipping could: · have an adverse impact on the quality of the coffee shipped, and thereby adversely affect our brand and reputation; · result in the disposal of an amount of coffee that could not be shipped in a timely manner; and · require us to contract with alternative, and possibly more expensive, common carriers. Any significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices, which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer. We depend on the expertise of key personnel. If these individuals leave or change their role within our Company without effective replacements, our operations may suffer. The success of our business is dependent to a large degree on our management and our coffee roasters and purchasers. If members of our management leave without effective replacements, our ability to implement our business strategy could be impaired. If we lost the services of our coffee roasters and purchasers, our ability to source and purchase a sufficient supply of high-quality coffee beans and roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer. In either case, our business and operations could be adversely affected. We may not be able to hire or retain additional management and other personnel and our recruiting and training costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase our costs and reduce our profits and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy. The success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated, well-qualified management and other personnel, including technical personnel and retail employees. We face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees. Our ability to execute our business strategy may suffer if: · we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees; · the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially; or · the costs of outsourcing certain tasks to third-party providers increase substantially. A significant interruption in the operation of our roasting and distribution facility could potentially disrupt our operations. We have only one roasting and distribution facility that roasts Peet’s coffee. A significant interruption in the operation of our roasting and distribution facility, whether as a result of a natural disaster, pandemic or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business. Since we only roast our coffee to order, we do not carry inventory of roasted coffee in our roasting plant. Therefore, a disruption in service in our roasting facility would impact our sales in our retail and specialty channels almost immediately. Moreover, our roasting and distribution facility and most of our stores are located near several major earthquake faults and our roastery is located directly on the bay in Alameda. The impact of a major earthquake or tsunami on our facilities, infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict and an earthquake or tsunami could seriously disrupt our entire business. A major earthquake or tsunami could seriously disrupt our entire business. Our roasting and distribution facility and several dozens of our stores are located near several major earthquake faults and near the water in the San Francisco Bay area. The impact of a major earthquake and/or tsunami in the San Francisco Bay area on our facilities, infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict, and an earthquake or tsunami could seriously disrupt our entire business. Our insurance may not adequately cover our losses and expenses in the event of an earthquake. As a result, a major earthquake or tsunami in the San Francisco Bay area could not only seriously disrupt our business, but may also lead to substantial losses. 9 Our costs could be negatively affected by an unpredictable workers' compensation environment. The majority of our employees are located in California, which has experienced higher workers compensation costs and rates than other states. For the policy years beginning March 2002 through February 2008 our workers' compensation insurance program was a modified self-insured program with a high deductible and an overall program ceiling to limit exposure. For those years, we have established a reserve of $0.5 million. However, the settlement costs for the remaining claims for those years could exceed our reserves. For the policy years beginning March 1, 2008, we have purchased a guaranteed cost policy. As a result, for 2008 and subsequent policy years, we remain exposed to premium fluctuations due to California’s unpredictable workers compensation environment and rising costs and our historical worker compensation experience. Settlement costs in excess of our reserves (for claims before March 2008) or an increase in insurance premiums could impair our profitability. Our roasting methods are not proprietary, so competitors may be able to duplicate them, which could harm our competitive position. We consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our roasted whole bean coffee and, therefore, essential to our brand. Because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods, it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods. If our competitors copy our roasting methods, the value of our brand may be diminished, and we may lose customers to our competitors. In addition, competitors may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than our roasting methods, which may also harm our competitive position. Competition in the specialty coffee market is intense and could affect our profits and outlook. The specialty coffee category is highly competitive and fragmented among various distribution channels. Our major distribution channels remain coffeehouses (our retail segment) and grocery stores (part of our specialty segment), but coffee is sold by coffee roasters like Peet’s to foodservice operators, direct to consumers through websites and mail order, offices and other places where coffee is consumed or purchased for home consumption. In addition, the single cup coffee market, though still in the early stages, is growing rapidly. The United States single cup market is currently dominated by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (“GMCR”) with its cartridge-based Keurig® K-Cup brewing system. Starbucks and GMCR announced in March 2011 that Starbucks is “the exclusive, licensed super-premium coffee brand produced by GMCR for the Keurig Single-Cup brewing system.” There are also several other large, well funded participants with cartridge- or pod-based systems competing in this market including Nestle (Nespresso and Dolce Gusto), Kraft (Tassimo), Sara Lee (Senseo) and Mars (Flavia). Currently, most, but not all, single cup cartridge- or pod-based brewing systems are proprietary and could require us to come to an agreement with the owner of the brewing system to have Peet’s-branded coffee and tea available in cartridges that work in the brewers. If the single cup cartridge or pod-based market of proprietary brewing systems continues to grow rapidly at the expense of the non-proprietary single cup brewing methods or existing drip brewing methods and we do not participate in that market segment, our revenue and profit margins could be negatively impacted in the future. Many of Peet’s competitors, including Starbucks, GMCR, Millstone (J.M. Smucker) Nestle and Kraft, are much larger and have greater financial resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may greater flexibility and resources to react to changes in the market. For instance, we were unable to purchase Diedrich Coffee in 2009, because GMCR, the eventual purchaser of Diedrich Coffee, had substantially greater financial resources than us and was able to pay a substantially higher purchase price for Diedrich Coffee. Our competitors may continue to use their size and financial resources to impair our ability to execute our business strategy and reduce our profit margins in the future. Adverse public or medical opinion about caffeine may harm our business. Our specialty coffee contains significant amounts of caffeine and other active compounds, the health effects of some of which are not fully understood. A number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate, nausea and vomiting, restlessness and anxiety, depression, headaches, tremors, sleeplessness and other adverse health effects. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly reduce the demand for coffee, which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits. In addition, we could become subject to litigation relating to the existence of such compounds in our coffee; litigation that could be costly and could divert management attention. 10 Adverse publicity regarding product quality or food and beverage safety, whether or not accurate, may harm our business. We may be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging beverage and food-related illnesses, injuries suffered on the premises or other quality, health or operational concerns. Adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect us, regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable. In addition, any litigation relating to such allegations could be costly and could divert management attention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not Applicable.
