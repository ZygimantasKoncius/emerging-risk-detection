ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Company operates in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect its operations. The following highlights some of these factors that have affected, or may affect, the Company's operations. IF OUR MARKETING EFFORTS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MAINTAIN AND EXPAND OUR BRAND NAME RECOGNITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. We believe that broader recognition and favorable perception of our brand-name by consumers in our target markets are essential to our future success. To increase brand-name recognition, we believe we must continue to devote significant amounts of time and resources to advertising and promotions. These expenditures, however, may not result in favorable increase in recognition of our brand-name or a sufficient increase in revenues to cover such advertising and promotional expenses. In addition, even if our brand recognition increases, our consumer base and our revenues may not increase, and may in fact decline, either of which would harm our business. 8 WE DEPEND ON CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES AND THE LOSS OF THESE EMPLOYEES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS We are dependent on the services of Seth Horowitz, our Chairman of our Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as other key members of our management team. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Horowitz and he has agreed to continue his employment and not to compete with us. In addition, we employ an executive who is solely responsible for worldwide licensing of the Everlast brand name. The failure of these executives or any other members of our management team to effectively work together could prevent efficient decision-making, affecting product development and sales and marketing efforts which would negatively impact our ability to manage our business and operations. In addition, the loss of the services of Mr. Horowitz or other key managers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. DEPENDENCE ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CYCLE Historically, our industry has experienced substantial changes in its business cycle. Recessions, the states of the global, national and local economies and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects affect consumer spending habits and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we, as well as our competitors, sell to retailers who have experienced financial difficulties during the past several years, which have led to, among other things, consolidation of retailers and stores. If these financial patterns continue or worsen, we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes that the sales of both sporting goods and licensing are slightly seasonal towards the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year. Our products, taken as a whole, are sold year-round. While our results of operations may vary quarterly, we do not believe that such variations are material to our business. Consequently, our results of operations in any one quarter are not representative of the results of operations we expect for other quarters or for the full fiscal year. CHANGES IN CONSUMER MARKET TRENDS; NEW PRODUCTS The market trends and consumer demands for Sporting Products and Licensed Products quickly change primarily due to the influence of fashion trends and developments of technology of raw materials. Our sporting goods business and our licensees' ability to anticipate, gauge and respond adequately and timely to rapid changes in consumer demand and market trends materially affect our business and results of operations. If we or our licensees do not effectively adapt to the quick changes in customer demands and market trends, we may not be able to achieve our profitability goals. WE RELY ON A FEW CUSTOMERS FOR A LARGE PORTION OF NET SALES FROM SPORTING GOODS AND WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG TERM CONTACTS WITH ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS For each of the fiscal years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003, Sports Authority has accounted for approximately 13% of our sales of Sports Products. Sports Authority Inc. has been our customer since 1992 although no long term contract exists between us and them. Although we believe that our business relationship with Sports Authority is satisfactory, we cannot assure you, you that this business relationship will continue to generate satisfactory sales in the future. We are also trying to expand our network of retailers carrying our products. We plan to focus on sporting goods stores, mass merchandisers, gymnasiums and martial arts studios for our Sports Products. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our market. 9 WE RELY ON OUR ROYALTY STREAM FROM THE LICENSING OF OUR EVERLAST TRADEMARK TO NUMEROUS GLOBAL LICENSEES Our net revenues from our licensing business has grown substantially in the last few years from approximately $5 million for the year ending December 31, 2001 to $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. For fiscal year 2005, one licensee accounted for approximately 20% of our gross licensing revenues and we believe that an adverse affect in its business and results of operations, would negatively impact the Company's revenues and results of operations. WE DEPEND ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT THESE RIGHTS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR LICENSING BUSINESS Our success is dependent upon the continued protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Counterfeit versions of our products may harm our reputation for producing high quality products and lead to losses in future periods. Accordingly, we devote resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks on a worldwide basis. We may be forced to incur substantial costs to protect our intellectual property and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the image of our brand may suffer. Our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and some of our trademarks are instrumental to our ability to create and sustain demand for and market our products. We cannot assure you that third-parties, particularly in other countries, will not assert claims to our trademarks and other intellectual property or that we will be able to successfully resolve those claims. While we seek international protection of our intellectual property, the laws of some foreign countries may not allow us to protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, we could incur substantial costs to defend legal actions taken against us relating to our use of trademarks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS WILL BE COMPLIED WITH AND NON COMPLIANCE MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS We require our licensees to submit samples of products that are to be sold under exclusive license agreements and licensees who are not in compliance with our quality control standards are in breach of their license agreements. These sample Licensed Products are inspected by our management for quality and proper placement of our Everlast(R) trademark. Licensees that do not comply with our quality or trademark standards are notified that they are in breach of their license agreement. No assurance may be made, however, that all non-compliant Licensed Products will be identified and that the non-compliant licensees will be notified of the breach of their license agreement. We have quality control procedures in effect at our manufacturing facility in Moberly, Missouri. Manufacturing supervisors inspect Sports Products for defects throughout both the manufacturing process and the finishing stages. No assurance may be made, however, that these quality control procedures will prevent all defects of manufacturing and finishing. IF THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO IMPOSE TARIFFS AND IMPORT QUOTA RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED IN CHINA, OUR LICENSEES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR MANUFACTURING NEEDS FROM COUNTRIES OTHER THAN CHINA OR FROM DOMESTIC SOURCES. The United States and the countries in which our products are produced for our licensees or sold internationally have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels. Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization, or WTO, Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, effective as of January 1, 2005, the United States and other WTO member countries eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result of the eliminated quotas, our licensees experienced lower costs on their imports of finished goods which benefited their margins and operating profitability in the second half of fiscal year 2005. The United 10 States has now imposed quotas on certain categories of products that our licensees import from China, including, but not limited to, certain shirts and certain sportswear. If our licensees are unable to meet their product needs either from countries not affected by the United States' restrictions or tariffs or from domestic sources, it could materially affect their gross margin and financial performance, which may in turn materially affect our license revenues and financial performance. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION AND IT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE Aggressive competition is found in the licensing and manufacture of sporting goods brands. We believe that the Everlast(R) trademark, however, is the most recognized brand associated with the sport of boxing. We also believe that none of our competitors in the boxing segment of the sporting goods industry have significant licensing programs. We cannot assure you that we will effectively compete against our competitors and this could have a material adverse affect on our financial performance. WE RECENTLY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS AND OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As a result of a borrowing consummated on February 8, 2006, we have incurred $25,000,000 of debt. While we believe that we currently generate cash sufficient to pay the principal and interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due, a payment of $15.5 million is due on December 31, 2009 for which we may not have sufficient cash. In addition, our level of indebtedness could have other effects on our future operations, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and our ability to obtain additional financing. POTENTIAL SPORTS PRODUCT LIABILITY EXPOSURE MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS Our Sports Products are exposed to an inherent risk of potential product liability claims as boxing is a high-risk activity which involves physical contact. A judgment against us due to an alleged failure or defects of our Sports Product could lead to substantial damage awards. Although we invest resources in research and development and every attempt is made to ensure the safety of the Sport Products, claims against us may arise and regardless of their merit or eventual outcome these claims may have a material adverse effect on the consumer demand for our products. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITY AND AN UNFORESEEN NATURAL OCCURRENCE, ACT OF WAR OR ACT OF TERRORISM COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OPERATIONS AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR SPORT PRODUCTS BUSINESS We own a manufacturing and distribution facility in Moberly, Missouri of approximately 304,000 square feet. If a situation arises that would cause the Missouri manufacturing plant to close down or reduce our production, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. These situations may include fire, floods, power loss, power shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Furthermore, certain actions domestically or abroad could lead to business disruptions or to cancellations of customer orders or a general decrease in consumer spending. Our products are considered non-essential and their demand is highly elastic with the spending capability of our customers. An economic slow-down may have a material effect on our financial performance. 11 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED SEC COMMENTS None
