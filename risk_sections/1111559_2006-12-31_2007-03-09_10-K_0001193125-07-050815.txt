ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this report, as well as the preceding Business section of this report, should be read and evaluated together with the issues, uncertainties and risk factors relating to our business described below. While we have been and continue to be confident in our business and business prospects, we believe it is very important that anyone who reads this report consider these issues, uncertainties and risk factors, which include business risks relevant both to our industry and to us in particular. These issues, uncertainties and risk factors are not intended to be exclusive. Issues, uncertainties and risk factors are also included in other sections of this report when specifically relevant to a statement we have made about an aspect of our business, or our financial condition or results of operations. This report also contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this report, the words anticipate(s), anticipated, anticipation, assume(s), assumption(s), become(s), belief(s), believe(s), believed, could, designed, estimate, estimates, estimated, expect(s), expected, expectation(s), going forward, future, hopeful, hope(s), intend(s), intended, look forward, may, might, opportunity, opportunities, outlook(s), pending, plan(s), planned, potential, scheduled, shall, should, think(s), to be, upcoming, well-positioned, will, wish, would, and similar expressions, if and to the extent used, are intended to identify the forward-looking statements. 14 Table of Contents All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report. Actual results may differ materially from the results suggested in this report. Factors that may cause or contribute to such differences, and our business risks and uncertainties generally, include, but are not limited to, the items described below, as well as those described in other sections of this report, our other public filings and our press releases. There Are Several Factors That May Cause Fluctuations In Our Quarterly Operating Results, Which Could Result In Significant Volatility In Our Stock Price Quarterly revenues and operating results of TradeStation Group have fluctuated significantly in the past, and our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future. Causes of such significant fluctuations may include, but are not limited to:  general economic and market factors that affect active trading and brokerage revenues, including trade volume, market volatility, market direction or trends, the level of confidence and trust in the markets, and seasonality (summer months and holiday seasons typically being slower periods), and changes in interest rates  a significant and growing portion of our revenues is interest income, and increases or decreases in short-term rates may have a material impact on our revenues and net income;  market or competitive pressure to lower commissions and fees charged to customers (our competitors continue to reduce their online brokerage commissions and we have recently announced a reduction in our futures commission pricing), or to reduce or eliminate monthly platform fees paid by brokerage customers (we have recently, on more than one occasion, materially reduced the trading activity thresholds our brokerage clients need to meet to qualify for a waiver of monthly platform fees), or to reduce interest rates charged to customers for margin loans or to increase the interest rates used to credit customers account cash balances;  the quality and success of, and potential continuous changes in, sales or marketing strategies (which continue to evolve), including the effects of our recent decisions to change the structure of, and reduce, our futures commission pricing and to lower materially the trade activity thresholds that need to be met for a brokerage customers $99.95 monthly platform fee to be waived;  technical difficulties, errors and/or failures in our electronic and software products, services and systems relating to market data, order execution and trade processing and reporting, and other software or system errors and failures (there have been several market data and order execution outages recently, the causes of which we have been working to correct, as well as failures to perform on the part of the brokerage firms back-office system vendor), any of which could result in a business or legal requirement to issue large credit amounts to customers, loss of accounts, reduced trading activity, loss of or diminished reputation and recognition in the industry, increased monetary costs and diversion of internal resources, regulatory inquiries, fines and sanctions, and other material adverse consequences (also, we do not maintain a seamless, redundant back-up system to our order execution systems, which could materially intensify the negative consequences described above); 15 Table of Contents  pending or potential third-party claims or regulatory matters that turn out to be significantly more costly, in terms of both judgment or settlement amounts and legal expenses (or the refusal or failure of our insurer to make payments), or fines, than we currently estimate or expect, including, but not necessarily limited to, the two remaining claims filed in 2003 by the co-founders of the predecessor company to TradeStation Securities against the company, certain of its executive officers and directors and certain family partnerships owned by the two former Co-Chief Executive Officers (which seek, in the aggregate, tens of millions of dollars in damages), and pending issues relating to NASD OATS reporting, NYSE OTS reporting, and NASD short sale procedures;  acquisitions of businesses, assets, accounts or similar transactions relating to company growth or strategies, which may significantly impact future financial results, our balance sheet and our cash position depending upon the type and size of any such transaction;  variations from our expectations with respect to hiring and retention of personnel, sales and marketing expenditures, product development, customer account growth, customer trading activity and the share volume of customer trades, or other revenue or expense items;  the ability to collect unsecured accounts receivable that may arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business or otherwise;  the timing and success of our planned 2007 launch of a seamless forex trading platform;  the success or lack thereof of the companys new product feature that enables the design, testing and automation of fundamental data strategies;  costs, material shifts in cash requirements and/or adverse financial consequences that may occur with respect to clearing organization, clearing agent and/or exchange requirements, or regulatory issues, including exchange, clearing agent or clearing organization cash deposit requirements, reserve and settlement requirements and other financial requirements;  if revenues are lower than budgeted expectations (as a result of lower-than-expected share volume, brokerage accounts, assets per equity account or daily average trades or other reasons), the negative effects of such lower revenues to our bottom line, including our inability to make in a timely fashion commensurate expense reductions (as a large amount of our expenses do not vary with revenues in the short term);  changes in demand for our products and services due to the rapid pace at which new technology is offered to customers in our industry;  the size and frequency of any trading errors or unsecured brokerage account debit balances for which we may ultimately suffer the economic burden, in whole or in part (including losses from third-party claims that may arise from time to time  since June 1, 2002, we have not carried errors or omissions insurance for third-party claims);  the appeal of our products and services to the forex and institutional markets (given our limited experience selling to those markets), and the cost of technology development and sales, marketing, compliance, technical, administrative and other infrastructure that may be required to improve our chances of success in those markets; 16 Table of Contents  the appeal of our products and services to markets outside of the United States (principally Europe), given our lack of experience selling to markets outside of the United States, our success (or lack of success) in developing or enhancing products or services that may be more attractive to non-US traders, and the costs, including sales, marketing, compliance, administrative and development, that may be required to improve our chances of success in those markets; and  the effect of any decision to suspend or terminate the companys current share buy back plan. Conditions In The Securities And Financial Markets May Affect Our Rates Of Customer Acquisition, Retention And Trading Activity, And Level of Interest Income Our products and services are, and will continue to be, designed for customers who trade actively in the securities and financial markets. To the extent that interest in active trading, or trading generally, decreases due to low trading volumes, lack of volatility, significant downward movement in the securities or financial markets, or negative market sentiment, or future tax law changes, recessions, depressions, wars, terrorism (including cyberterrorism), or otherwise, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Unfavorable market conditions have, historically, seemed to severely negatively impact the share price of publicly-held online brokerage firms, and also usually result in more losses for our customers, which could result in increases in quantity and size of errors or omissions or other claims that may be made against us by customers. We do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover, in part, some of those potential claims. See The Nature Of Our Business Results In Potential Liability To Customers below. Also, we derive a significant portion of our brokerage revenues from interest income on customers credit balances and account borrowings. Therefore, changes in interest rates or in the size of such balances and borrowings, depending upon the extent of the change, could materially change, positively or negatively (depending upon the direction of the change) the amount of our interest income. Our Industry Is Intensely Competitive, Which Makes It Difficult To Attract And Retain Customers The markets for online brokerage services, trading software tools, and real-time market data services are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, and there has been substantial consolidation of those three products and services in the industry, as well as consolidation of the types of financial instruments (equities, equity options, futures, forex) offered by firms. There has also been consolidation of online brokerage firms generally, as well as intense price competition. We believe that competition from large online and other large brokerage firms and smaller brokerage firms focused on active traders, as well as consolidation, will continue. Recently, some of our larger competitors have been adding or emphasizing rule-based or strategy trading products and features to the active trader market, including comparison advertisements with our active trader offering. Competition may be further intensified by the size of the active trader market, which is generally thought to be comprised of less than 10% of all online brokerage accounts. We believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control. Factors outside of our control include: price pressure (on transactional commissions, monthly platform fees and interest rates offered to customers for both credit balances and account borrowings); the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by our competitors (including strategy back-testing and automation capabilities); market conditions, such as recession; the size of 17 Table of Contents the active trader market today and in the future; the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use electronic brokerage services from firms that have traditionally served mostly retail customers; data availability and cost; and exchange and third-party clearing costs. Factors over which we have more control, but which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties with respect to our ability to effectively compete, include: timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements we develop; our ability to meet changing market demands for a unified, integrated trading platform that offers customers the ability to trade and manage portfolios containing multiple asset classes; our ability to design, improve and support materially error-free and sufficiently robust Internet-based systems; ease-of-use of our products and services; reliability of our products and services; and pricing decisions and other sales and marketing decisions and efforts (we have recently reduced futures commission pricing and our monthly platform fee waiver thresholds). Systems Failures May Result In Our Inability To Deliver Accurately, On Time, Or At All, Important And Time-Sensitive Services To Our Customers The online electronic trading platform we provide to our customers is based upon the integration of our sophisticated front-end software technology with our equally-sophisticated, Internet-based server farm technology. Our server farm technology is the foundation upon which online trading customers receive real-time market data and place buy and sell orders. However, in order for this technology to provide a live, real-time trading platform, it requires integration with real-time market data, which are currently provided directly by the exchanges or by systems of independent third-party market data vendors (who obtain the data directly from the exchanges), the electronic order book systems of ECNs and electronic systems offered by the exchanges, the clearing and back-office systems we license from SunGard for self-clearing and of the clearing agents we use for trades that we do not self-clear, and the forex deal order placement, settlement and back-office systems of or licensed to the forex dealer firm which is responsible for all of our customers forex trades. Accordingly, our ability to offer a platform that enables the development, testing and automation of trading strategies and the placement, execution, clearing and settlement of buy and sell orders depends heavily on the effectiveness, integrity, reliability and consistent performance of all of these systems and technologies. In particular, the stress that is placed on these systems during peak trading times could cause one or more of these systems to operate too slowly or fail. Outages and other system failures may also be caused by natural disasters and other events and circumstances beyond our control. We have experienced several delays and outages since we launched our online trading platform, many of which related to data vendor, clearing agent, exchange and ECN outages or issues which are beyond our control. There have also been several market data and order execution outages recently, as well as failures to perform on the part of the brokerage firms back-office system vendor. Any major system failure or outage (or series of frequent failures or outages), regardless of the cause, could result in a business or legal requirement to issue large credit amounts to customers, loss of accounts, reduced trading activity, loss of or diminished reputation and recognition in the industry, increased monetary costs and diversion of internal resources, regulatory inquiries, fines and sanctions, and other material adverse consequences. Also, we do not maintain a seamless, redundant back-up system to our order execution systems, which could materially intensify these negative consequences. Additionally, as a general matter not applicable only to our company, the integrity of these types of systems may be attacked by persons sometimes referred to as hackers who intentionally introduce viruses or other defects to cause damage, inaccuracies or complete failure. Also, cyberterrorism, should it occur, may significantly affect peoples willingness to use Internet-based services, particularly ones that involve their personal or companys assets. 18 Table of Contents During a system outage or failure, our brokerage may be able to take orders by telephone; however, only associates with appropriate licenses, knowledge and experience can accept telephone orders, and an adequate number of associates likely would not be available to take customer calls in the event of a system outage or failure. System delays, errors, outages and failures, depending upon how serious and how often they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See The Nature Of Our Business Results In Potential Liability To Customers below. The Loss Of Key Employees Could Decrease The Quality Of Our Management And Operations  Most Recently, The Companys Co-Founders, Co-Chairmen and Co-CEOs Have Announced They Are Transitioning Out of Their Day-To-Day Roles And Will No Longer Serve As Executive Officers Our success depends to a very significant extent on the continued availability and performance of a number of senior management and product development personnel. The loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our company. In particular there may be adverse consequences to the company and/or its operations as a result of the recent change in company senior management roles, which included the transition of William and Ralph Cruz, the companys co-founders and co-chairmen, out of their day-to-day senior management roles as Co-CEOs. The causes of potential adverse consequences may include changes in management styles or decisions that produce less favorable results than would have been produced under the prior management structure. We Are Exposed to Credit Risk We make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities, and borrow securities to cover trades. In fact, nearly all of our clients accounts are margin, as opposed to cash, brokerage accounts. A portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans. To the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us, we must obtain financing from third parties. We may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts. By permitting clients to purchase securities on margin, we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit, especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral substantially decreases in proportion to the amount of a clients indebtedness. While we have implemented additional risk-management procedures designed to reduce this risk, there can be no assurance that we will not experience periodic or frequent unsecured account debits that materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders. Sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. The Nature Of Our Business Results In Potential Liability To Customers Many aspects of the securities, futures and forex brokerage business, including online trading services, involve substantial risks of liability. In recent years there has been a high incidence of litigation involving the securities and futures brokerage industry, including both class action and individual suits and arbitrations that generally seek substantial damages, including in some cases punitive damages. Our proprietary order routing technology, in addition to offering charting, trade analysis and trade execution 19 Table of Contents services of various kinds, is designed to automatically locate, with immediacy, the best available price in the appropriate market in completing execution of a trade triggered by programmed market entry and exit rules. There are risks that the electronic communications and other systems upon which these products and services rely, and will continue to rely, or our products and services themselves, as a result of flaws or other imperfections or limitations in their designs or performance, may operate too slowly, fail, cause confusion or uncertainty to the user, or operate or produce results not understood or intended by the user. An investor or trader using either our full electronic trading platform or our subscription service might claim that investment or trading losses or lost profits resulted from use of a flawed version of one of our trading software tools or systems, or inaccurate assumptions made by the trading software tools regarding data, or inaccurate data. Major failures of this kind may affect all customers who are online simultaneously. Any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover, in part, some of the above-described risks. While our contracts with customers are, we believe, clear that customers who do business with us must knowingly assume all of the risks described above, there can be no assurance that a judge, arbitrator or regulator would enforce or honor such contractual provisions. See Conditions In The Securities And Financial Markets May Affect Our Rates Of Customer Acquisition, Retention And Trading Activity, And Level of Interest Income and Systems Failures May Result In Our Inability To Deliver Accurately, On Time, Or At All, Important And Time-Sensitive Services To Our Customers above. Dependence Upon Outside Data Sources And Clearing Relationships Creates Risks Outside Of Our Control Which May Affect Our Ability To Provide, And Our Cost To Provide, Market Data And Clearing And Account Services Our business is currently dependent upon our ability to maintain contracts with private market and news data vendors and clearing and dealer firms in order to provide certain market data and news, and clearing and account services, respectively, to our customers. We currently obtain NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, regional equities exchange, Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA), CME, CBOT, New York Mercantile Exchange/ Commodities Exchange (NYMEX/COMEX), New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), OneChicago and EUREX futures real-time market data directly from those exchanges, and real-time market depth displays directly from ECN book services, but obtain other market data (such as forex data) and news pursuant to non-exclusive licenses from private data vendors who in turn obtain the data from exchanges or other sources. Clearing and back-office account services for our brokerage customers are obtained from established clearing agents and, with respect to our self-clearing operations, our software system licensing agreement with SunGard. For our forex services, we rely on a third-party forex dealer firm for all trade activity account services. The data and news contracts typically provide for royalties based on usage or minimums, the clearing contracts provide for transactional clearing fees and charges, and the contract with the forex dealer provides for sharing a fixed amount of the spread made by the forex dealer in each deal. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or maintain contracts or acceptable clearing cost or vendor fee rates. In fact, in 2003 we needed to quickly change our futures clearing agent in response to a substantial increase in our clearing costs imposed by our former futures clearing agent. Changes (or, in some cases, the failure or inability to make changes) in our relationships with one or more of these third parties, or involuntary termination of one or more of those relationships, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 20 Table of Contents We May Be Subject To Intellectual Property Litigation There has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights. Although we do not believe that we are or will be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others, there was recently an infringement claim asserted against us and eight other online brokerage firms by a company named Datamize, Inc., which could have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if it was successful (we settled the suit in December 2004 for an amount immaterial to our financial statements). Such a case, as well as any other infringement case that may be brought against us, could result in our being unable to use intellectual property which is integral to our business. We May Not Be Able To Adequately Protect Or Preserve Our Rights In Intellectual Property Our success is and will continue to be heavily dependent on proprietary technology, including existing trading software, Internet, Web-site and order-execution technology, and those types of technology currently in development. We view our technology as proprietary, and rely, and will be relying, on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. We also have pending patent applications covering the TradeStation electronic platform, but we do not yet know if the patents will be issued. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services is difficult, however, and we may be unable to prevent, or unsuccessful in attempts to prevent, theft, copying or other unauthorized use or exploitation of our product and service technologies. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect (or defend) our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies or products and services. Self-Clearing Equity Trades For Active Trader Accounts Has Risks Self-clearing operations for our active trader equities accounts began in September 2004 and for options trades began in March 2005. Prior to the September conversion of clearing services, all of our customers equities trades were cleared through Bear Stearns, as our clearing agent, which also provided to our active trader clients its short sale borrowing inventory. Cost savings and efficiencies of self-clearing may in future periods turn out to be less favorable than we expect as a result of unanticipated increased fixed, infrastructure or incremental costs, mistakes or other factors. Further, errors made by us related to the confirmation, receipt, settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions, the custody and control of client securities and other assets, or otherwise relating to the handling of our clients securities and funds, could lead to civil penalties and increased deposit and other requirements by governmental and self-regulatory organizations, as well as losses and liability in lawsuits relating to client accounts affected by such errors. Also, our savings may be more than offset by account losses or reduced trading activity if we experience difficulties in providing to our clients sufficient short sale borrowing inventory or if any self-clearing mistakes or failures occur which undermine our customers or prospects confidence in our ability to conduct reliable self-clearing operations. Also, our self-clearing back-office operations rely on the Phase3 self-clearing software licensed to us by SunGard, and our business would likely suffer substantial harm if that software fails, fails to be adequately supported by SunGard, or otherwise causes unintended results. 21 Table of Contents We May Need Cash In The Foreseeable Future While we anticipate having sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next 12 months, our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including: the rate of customer acceptance of our products and services, including the number of new brokerage accounts acquired and the number and volume of trades made by our brokerage customers; the effect of price reductions; price competition that may result in our continuing to charge lower commissions and fees to customers; significant, increased infrastructure and operating costs as our business grows, large cash or security deposits (which were $20.2 million as of March 1, 2007, and which are expected to increase as our business grows); increased net capital or excess net capital requirements and unanticipated reserve and settlement requirements; unanticipated costs relating to our planned forex service offering; costs of technology development and sales, marketing, compliance, technical and administrative operations relating to increased and intensified pursuit of institutional customers; substantial legal costs and/or unexpected unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits and arbitrations currently pending against us; and competing technological and market developments. Funds, if and when needed, may be raised through debt financing and/or the issuance of equity securities, there being no assurance that any such type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur. Any equity financing or debt financing which requires issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender, or any securities litigation settlement or judgment that requires issuance of equity securities to the claimants, would reduce the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company. Shareholders also may, if issuance of equities occurs, experience additional dilution in net book value per share, or the issued equities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. Operation In A Highly-Regulated Industry And Compliance Failures May Result In Severe Penalties And Other Harmful Governmental Or SRO Actions Against Us The securities and commodity futures industries are subject to extensive regulation covering all aspects of those businesses. Regulation of forex dealer and brokerage services is increasing as well. The various governmental authorities and industry SROs that supervise and regulate our brokerage firm have broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, suspend, enjoin, expel or issue cease-and-desist orders to our brokerage firm or any of its officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, rules relating specifically to active traders have been enacted and more may be enacted which severely limit the operations and potential success of our business. For example, about six years ago, the NYSE and NASD required brokerage firms to establish systems that enabled them to identify pattern day traders and to ensure that those types of accounts maintained higher minimum account balances and stricter margin maintenance requirements. In a more recent example, in January 2005 new short sale rules promulgated by the SEC became effective that could have materially, adversely affected our ability to provide quality short sale brokerage services to our equities brokerage customers. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our brokerages maintenance of compliance and reporting systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other operations personnel and enter into suitable contractual relationships with appropriate vendors, lenders and counterparties. We currently have pending issues relating to NASD OATS reporting, NYSE OTS reporting, and NASD short sale procedures that could have negative consequences for our brokerage. In general, our brokerage could be subject to disciplinary or other regulatory or legal actions, fines and penalties in the future due to noncompliance. 22 Table of Contents Our Brokerage Must Meet Net Capital And Other Financial Requirements As A Broker-Dealer That, If Not Satisfied, Could Result In Severe Penalties Or Other Negative Consequences, And Which At All Times Limit Our Right To Use All Of The Brokerages Cash The SEC, the NASD, the CFTC, the NFA, the DTCC (i.e., NSCC and DTC), the OCC, certain exchanges and other regulatory and self-regulatory agencies or organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers and futures commission merchants, large, fluctuating cash deposit requirements, and reserve, settlement and other financial requirements. Net capital is the net worth of the regulated company (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges. If a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC or CFTC and suspension or expulsion by the NASD or NFA, and it could ultimately lead to the firms liquidation. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require the use of capital would be restricted. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from our TradeStation Securities brokerage subsidiary is subject to SEC rules, which in turn could materially impact our available working capital and materially impact or limit our ability to repay debt as and when due, redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock, if required or desirable, and pay dividends in the future. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our then present levels of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See We May Need Cash In The Foreseeable Future above. There Are Risks Relating To Our Ability To Maintain Customer Privacy And Security And That Increased Government Regulation Of Internet Business May Occur Customers may refuse to transact business over the Internet, particularly business, such as ours, that involves the handling of significant amounts of customers funds, due to privacy or security concerns. This risk will grow if, as and to the extent cyberterrorism occurs or is perceived to be a viable, prominent threat or likelihood to occur (or recur on a regular basis). We do incorporate security measures into our privacy policies. However, no assurances can be made that a breach of such measures will not occur, and a major breach of customer privacy or security could have serious consequences for our Internet-based operations, which are central to our business. Use of the Internet, particularly for commercial transactions, may not continue to increase as rapidly as it has during the past few years as a result of privacy or security concerns, or for other reasons. If this occurs, the growth of our operations would be materially hindered. If Internet activity becomes heavily regulated in these respects or otherwise, that could also have significant negative consequences for the growth of our current and planned operations. Control Of TradeStation Group By The Cruzes Means That Important Decisions Affecting The Company Are Concentrated In The Judgment Of Two Related Individuals As of March 1, 2007, affiliates of William R. Cruz and Ralph L. Cruz (the non-executive Co- Chairmen of our company) owned approximately 37% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and we believe that no other shareholder or related group owned more than 7%. Therefore, the Cruzes have significant control over TradeStation Group on matters subject to shareholder approval, including the election of our Board of Directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of TradeStation Groups assets that may be proposed. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
