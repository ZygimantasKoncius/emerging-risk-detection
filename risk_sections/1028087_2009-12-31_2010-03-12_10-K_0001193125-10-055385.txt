ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results would likely suffer, possibly materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Our business is highly dependent on the performance of the affiliated practices, which are predominantly independent third-parties that exercise sole decision-making authority with respect to all clinical matters. We derive our net revenue primarily from revenue generated by the affiliated practices. The affiliated practices, with the exception of Arizona Tooth Doctor, are independent third parties. We cannot be certain that the affiliated practices will operate their businesses successfully or realize their full revenue potential. The affiliated practices have sole decision-making authority with respect to all clinical matters. Because clinical decisions are made without revenue considerations, we cannot be certain what impact those decisions may have on the revenue of the affiliated practices. The affiliated practices, other then Arizona Tooth Doctor, control all employment decisions regarding dentists, and, with respect to certain affiliated practices, dental hygienists and assistants. The affiliated practices may, among other things, ineffectively recruit or manage their employees resulting in high employee turnover, loss of key personnel, employment disputes, any of which could negatively affect the revenue of the affiliated practices. The restrictive covenants that we rely upon to protect, in part, the value of our investments in the affiliated practices may be difficult or costly to enforce. We invest substantial sums to affiliate with practices and to maintain and support their growth. As part of the affiliation process, we acquire certain assets of the affiliated practice. The asset acquisition agreement typically includes time-limited covenants that restrict, among other things, the sellers from providing competing business services or interfering with our relationships with personnel or business partners. Although we believe that these restrictive covenants are reasonable to protect our investments and we attempt to draft such covenants to be legally enforceable, we cannot guarantee that such covenants will be upheld as reasonable and enforced, in whole or in part, by a court of competent jurisdiction if legally challenged. Additionally, we may incur significant costs defending the legality of the covenants. To the extent any of the restrictive covenants are unenforceable or enforcement proves not to be cost-effective, our investments may diminish in value, our competitive position may be compromised and our results of operation may suffer. Our business model is dependent upon the enforceability and legality of the service agreements between us and the affiliated practices. Our net revenue derives primarily from revenue generated by the affiliated practices. The service agreements create the affiliations and establish the terms under which we receive payment for the management services that we provide to the affiliated practices. We structure the service agreement in the context of each affiliation to comply with relevant state laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those concerning the practice of dentistry. We cannot, however, be certain that our interpretations of certain laws and regulations are correct. State regulatory authorities have in the past reviewed, and may in the future review, our service agreement for legal and regulatory compliance. To the extent our service agreement with any affiliated practice were deemed 15 Table of Contents by a regulatory or judicial authority to be in violation of any law or regulation, our relationship with that affiliated practice might terminate, the service agreement might require material amendments with uncertain consequences, or we might be required to restructure our business model at significant cost. A significant percentage of our net revenue results from a disproportionately small number of affiliated practices. Revenue generated from our service agreements with Northland Dental Partners, PLLC, the affiliated practice at Metro Dentalcare, and with Wisconsin Dental Group, S.C., the affiliated practice at ForwardDental, represented 22% and 14%, respectively of our consolidated net revenue in 2009. The termination of either of these service agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The recent economic downturn has negatively affected consumer demand for dental care, which may negatively affect revenue and profitability. Our net revenue depends primarily on revenue generated by the affiliated practices. Demand for dental care has declined among patients both with and without dental insurance. We estimate approximately 90% of patients at the affiliated practices have dental insurance. In general, dental insurance covers 100% of preventative care, 80% of basic restorative procedures and 50% of more extensive restorative procedures. In addition, dental insurance often caps benefits at an annual maximum of $1,000 to $1,500. As a result, even patients with dental insurance are financially responsible for a considerable portion of their dental expenditures. The recent economic downturn has caused consumer spending patterns to change. The affiliated practices have observed patients either delaying care or, for those patients with dental insurance, opting for dental procedures that are largely covered by insurance. As a result, revenue growth rates of the affiliated practices have decreased and revenue mix has shifted towards lower cost and lower profitability dental procedures. The effect to us has been lower net revenue and lower profit margins. We anticipate that negative macroeconomic conditions will continue to adversely affect our business in 2010, although we are unable to predict the likely duration or severity of those conditions or the magnitude effect on our business or results of operations. We do not, however, believe that the current economic conditions will lessen the dental care needs of patients and do not therefore expect lasting long-term impact on the dental care industry. Our net revenue may be adversely affected by third-party payor cost containment efforts. A significant portion of the payments for dental care that is received by the affiliated practices is paid or reimbursed under insurance programs with third-party payors. To contain reimbursement and utilization rates, third-party payors often attempt to, or do in fact, amend or renegotiate their fee reimbursement schedules. Loss of revenue by the affiliated practices caused by third-party payor cost containment efforts or an inability to negotiate satisfactory reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. Our net revenue at Arizona Tooth Doctor and Texas Tooth Doctor may be adversely affected by changes in state Medicaid programs. Arizona Tooth Doctor and Texas Tooth Doctor are largely dependent upon reimbursements from authorized third-party payors operating under state Medicaid programs. Certain states, including Arizona, have recently reduced or proposed reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates in response to state budgetary shortfalls. These reductions generally are passed on to contracted practices and negatively affect revenue and operating results. We and the affiliated practices are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations. If we or the affiliated practices fail to comply with existing or new laws or regulations, we or they could suffer civil or criminal penalties. The practice of dentistry is highly regulated. Our operations and those of the affiliated dental groups are subject to a broad range of state and federal laws, regulations and licensing requirements, including laws and regulations 16 Table of Contents affecting the structure of our relationships with the affiliated practices, governing the qualifications and conduct of clinical personnel, billing and reimbursement, fee splitting, patient referrals, advertising and regarding privacy and security of protected health information. The substance and enforcement of many of these laws and regulations, particularly at the state level, lack consistency from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In certain jurisdictions, laws and regulations may be ambiguous or vague without clarifying case law or administrative guidance. Although we strive to maintain a legally-compliant business, our operations may not be in compliance with certain laws or regulations, as written or as may be interpreted. Failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us or the affiliated practices to civil or criminal penalties, licensing or other sanctions, or refunding of reimbursement, that limit our ability to operate our business or their ability to provide dental services. In addition, the affiliated practices that provide services under Medicaid programs could be excluded from participating in those programs. Changes to laws and regulations pose two additional risks. First, as described above, failure to comply with changes to law and regulations may subject us or the affiliated practices to civil or criminal penalties, or licensing or other sanctions that limit our ability to operate our business or the ability of the practices to provide dental services. Second, changes to laws or regulations might have the effect of rendering invalid or illegal, in whole or in part, certain aspects of the services agreements between us and the affiliated practices. Sedation is used extensively by Arizona Tooth Doctor and Texas Tooth Doctor, and harm to a patient resulting from its use could have a material adverse effect on our business. Arizona Tooth Doctor and Texas Tooth Doctor utilize sedation extensively in providing dental services to patients, including children, ranging from conscious sedation to general anesthesia. Although we believe these affiliated practices have appropriate protocols and procedures in place for the safe and efficient use of sedation, a certain level of risk is inherent with those procedures, and there can be no assurance that harm to a patient will not occur. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on those affiliated practices, as well as our overall reputation. In addition, the ability of these affiliated practices to continue using sedation to the extent currently in use is dependent upon their ability to retain, credential and supervise a sufficient number of qualified professionals and staff to perform these services, whether anesthesiologists or certified registered nurse anesthetists as may be required under applicable protocols or legal requirements, and to obtain sufficient reimbursement for their services. There can be no assurance that either affiliated practice will be able to continue retaining and utilizing the services of these individuals, or that their services can be obtained on a cost-effective basis. New affiliations could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business or impair our financial results. To the extent we affiliate with new practices, we undertake certain risks that include, but are not limited to: difficulty assimilating the operations, assets and personnel that we acquire from the affiliated practice; potential loss of key employees from the affiliated practice; unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence; and the possibility of incurring impairment losses related to goodwill or other intangible assets that we acquire from the affiliated practice. We may not realize the expected value of our goodwill and intangible assets. A significant portion of our total assets are represented by goodwill and intangible assets. Our goodwill and intangible assets will likely increase to the extent we consummate additional affiliations or acquisitions in the future. The amortization expense related to definite lived intangible assets will also likely increase in the future as a result of additional intangible assets being recorded in connection with new affiliations. Management performs an impairment test on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or when facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired. An impairment test on goodwill and definite lived intangible assets is likewise performed when facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that the definite lived intangible asset may be impaired, such as loss of key personnel or contracts or change in legal factors. Impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to 17 Table of Contents assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. If impairment were determined, we would make the appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset to reduce the assets carrying value to fair value. In the event of any sale or liquidation of us or a portion of our assets, there can be no assurance that the value of our intangible assets will be realized. Any future determination requiring the write-off of goodwill, indefinite lived intangibles or a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could negatively affect our balance sheet. Our dental benefits third party administrator historically earned a significant percentage of its revenue from administering capitated managed care plans. As a result of the continuing decline of capitated managed care plans in the dental profession, our dental benefits third party administrator has been developing additional product offerings, including dental referral plans, to offset the decline of this part of its business. In 2009, our dental benefits third party administrator experienced a reduction of revenue and incurred an operating loss as a result of the continuing decline of administrative services for capitated managed care plans. Based on its business plan and future projections, we determined the fair value of this business reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of $2,266,000 at October 1, 2009. If this business plan is not successfully executed or projected financial results are not achieved, we may need to record an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the goodwill of this reporting unit. Our operating results may be adversely affected by professional liability claims against the affiliated practices. The affiliated practices and/or individual dentists in their employ are subject from time to time to professional liability claims, and it is possible that these claims could also be asserted against us. These claims, if successful, could result in substantial damage awards that could exceed the limits of our applicable insurance coverage. We are named as an insured under the professional liability insurance policy covering the affiliated practices. In addition, we require each affiliated practice to indemnify us for actions or omissions related to the provision of dental care by the affiliated practice. Nonetheless, a successful professional liability claim against an affiliated practice might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Interruptions in our information systems could limit our ability to operate our business. Our business is dependent on information systems, which could be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, human error, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. A significant or prolonged interruption in our computer network, data center or software applications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A catastrophic event may significantly limit our ability and that of the affiliated dental groups to conduct business as normal. We operate a complex, geographically dispersed business. Disruption or failure of networks or systems, or injury or damage to personnel or physical infrastructure, caused by a natural disaster, public health crisis, terrorism, cyber attack, act of war or other catastrophic event may significantly limit our ability and that of the affiliated practices to conduct business as normal, including our ability to communicate and transact with the affiliated practices, as well as with suppliers and vendors, and the ability of the affiliated practices to provide dental care to patients. We may not be adequately insured for all losses and disruptions caused by catastrophic events, and we may not have a sufficiently comprehensive enterprise-wide disaster recovery plan in place.
